12963346	Purification of recombinant plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in the active conformation by refolding from inclusion bodies.	Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) acts as the major inhibitor of fibrinolysis by inhibiting tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators. Although it shares a common tertiary structure with other serine protease inhibitors, PAI-1 is unique in its conformational lability, which allows conversion of the active form to the latent conformation under physiological conditions. Therefore, recombinant PAI-1 expressed in eukaryotic or prokaryotic cells almost always contains its inactive, latent form, with very low specific activity. In this study, we developed a simple and efficient method for purifying the active form of recombinant PAI-1 rather than the latent conformation from PAI-1 overexpressing Escherichia coli cells. The overall level of expression and the amount of PAI-1 found in inclusion bodies were found to increase with culture temperature and with time after induction. Refolding of unfolded PAI-1 from inclusion bodies and ion-exchange column chromatography were sufficient to purify PAI-1. The purified protein yielded a single, 43kDa protein band upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and it efficiently inhibited tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators similar to PAI-1 from natural sources. Activity measurements showed that PAI-1 purified from inclusion bodies exhibited a specific activity near the theoretical maximum, unlike PAI-1 prepared from cytosolic fractions. Conformational analysis by urea gel electrophoresis also indicated that the PAI-1 protein purified from inclusion bodies was indeed in its active conformation.	2003 Sep	Lee Hak-Joo,Im Hana	Protein expression and purification. 31(1) 99-107	Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPSSRVHHPPSYVAHLASDFGVRVFQQVAQASKDRNVVFSPYGVASVLAMLQLTTGGETQQQIQAAMGFKIDDKGMAPALRHLYKELMGPWNKDEISTTDAIFVQRDLKLVQGFMPHFFRLFRSTVKQVDFSEVERARFIINDWVKTHTKGMISNLLGKGAVDQLTRLVLVNALYFNGQWKTPFPDSSTHRRLFHKSDGSTVSVPMMAQTNKFNYTEFTTPDGHYYDILELPYHGDTLSMFIAAPYEKEVPLSALTNILSAQLISHWKGNMTRLPRLLVLPKFSLETEVDLRKPLENLGMTDMFRQFQADFTSLSDQEPLHVAQALQKVKIEVNESGTVASSSTAVIVSARMAPEEIIMDRPFLFVVRHNPTGTVLFMGQVMEPFEA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P05121			5.6	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11880376	Mutant Neuroserpin (S49P) that causes familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies is a poor proteinase inhibitor and readily forms polymers in vitro.	Familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB) is an autosomal dominant dementia that is characterized by intraneuronal inclusions of mutant neuroserpin. We report here the expression, purification, and characterization of wild-type neuroserpin and neuroserpin containing the S49P mutation that causes FENIB. Wild-type neuroserpin formed SDS-stable complexes with tPA with an association rate constant and K(i) of 1.2 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1) and 5.8 nm, respectively. In contrast, S49P neuroserpin formed unstable complexes with an association rate constant and K(i) of 0.3 x 10(4) m(-1) s(-1) and 533.3 nm, respectively. An assessment by circular dichroism showed that S49P neuroserpin had a lower melting temperature than wild-type protein (49.9 and 56.6 degrees C, respectively) and more readily formed loop-sheet polymers under physiological conditions. Neither the wild-type nor S49P neuroserpin accepted the P7-P2 alpha(1)-anti-trypsin or P14-P3 antithrombin-reactive loop peptides that have been shown to block polymer formation in other members of the serpin superfamily. Taken together, these data demonstrate that S49P neuroserpin is a poor proteinase inhibitor and readily forms loop-sheet polymers. These findings provide strong support for the role of neuroserpin polymerization in the formation of the intraneuronal inclusions that are characteristic of FENIB.	2002 May	Belorgey Didier,Crowther Damian C,Mahadeva Ravi,Lomas David A	The Journal of biological chemistry. 277(19) 17367-73	Neuroserpin	MRGSHHHHHHADLSVNMYNRLRATGEDENILFSPLSIALAMGMMELGAQGSTQKEIRHSMGYDSLKNGEEFSFLKEFSNMVTAKESQYVMKIANSLFVQNGFHVNEEFLQMMKKYFNAAVNHVDFSQNVAVANYINKWVENNTNNLVKDLVSPRDFDAATYLALINAVYFKGNWKSQFRPENTRTFSFTKDDESEVQIPMMYQQGEFYYGEFSDGSNEAGGIYQVLEIPYEGDEISMMLVLSRQEVPLATLEPLVKAQLVEEWANSVKKQKVEVYLPRFTVEQEIDLKDVLKALGITEIFIKDANLTGLSDNKEIFLSKAIHKSFLEVNEEGSEAAAVSGMIAISRMAVLYPQVIVDHPFFFLIRNRRTGTILFMGRVMHPETMNTSGHDFEEL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q99574			7.8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12182837	Preparation of active recombinant cathepsin K expressed in bacteria as inclusion body.	Human cathepsin K (EC 3.4.22.38) is a member of the cysteine protease family with high primary sequence homology to cathepsins S, L, and B. It has been shown that cathepsin K plays a major role in the resorption of the bone matrix by osteoclasts. Cathepsin K has a potential as a drug target for the diseases related to bone matrix metabolism such as osteoporosis. We have expressed recombinant human procathepsin K in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Purified procathepsin K had size of 38kDa which is in agreement with the predicted mass of the construct. Refolding was done by rapid dilution into 50mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 buffer containing 5mM EDTA, 10 mM GSH, 1mM GSSG, 0.7 M L-arginine, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1% CHAPS and further dialysis against 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 containing 0.5 M NaCl. Mature active cathepsin K was prepared from refolded procathepsin K by incubating at 40 degrees C in pH 4.0 buffers with or without pepsin or cysteine. The presence of pepsin or cysteine in autocatalysis buffer did not have effect on the degree of conversion of nascent to mature cathepsin K, but reduced the autocatalysis time slightly. Proteolytic activity was confirmed using synthetic substrate, and Western blotting identified mature cathepsin K. Active cathepsin K had type I and II collagenolytic activities which could be inhibited by E-64.	2002 Aug	Hwang Hyo-Sung,Chung Hye-Shin	Protein expression and purification. 25(3) 541-6	ProCathepsin K	MRGSHHHHHHLYPEEILDTHWELWKKTHRKQYNNKVDEISRRLIWEKNLKYISIHNLEASLGVHTYELAMNHLGDMTSEEVVQKMTGLKVPLSHSRSNDTLYIPEWEGRAPDSVDYRKKGYVTPVKNQGQCGSCWAFSSVGALEGQLKKKTGKLLNLSPQNLVDCVSENDGCGGGYMTNAFQYVQKNRGIDSEDAYPYVGQEESCMYNPTGKAAKCRGYREIPEGNEKALKRAVARVGPVSVAIDASLTSFQFYSKGVYYDESCNSDNLNHAVLAVGYGIQKGNKHWIIKNSWGENWGNKGYILMARNKNNACGIANLASFPKM	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P43235			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11812217	High-level expression of human extracellular superoxide dismutase in Escherichia coli and insect cells.	Much is known about the physical properties of the Cu,Zn- and Mn-superoxide dismutases (SODs). However, the biochemical characteristics and pharmacological properties of extracellular (EC)-SOD have been severely limited due to difficulties in obtaining and purifying the enzyme. The EC-SOD cDNA was inserted into the Escherichia coli expression plasmid pET-28a(+) which contains the T7 promoter and transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3). After induction with 1 mmol/L isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside, the recombinant human EC-SOD was highly expressed as inclusion bodies. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that recombinant EC-SOD accumulated up to 260f the total soluble protein of E. coli cells. The expression product was purified by a Ni(2+)-IDA-Sepharose 6B column. After the denaturing and refolding processes, the recombinant human EC-SOD retains the specific enzymatic activity of 920 U/mg of the purified product. The gene encoding human EC-SOD mature peptide was also inserted into the donor plasmid pFastBacHTb. After transposition, transfection, and amplification were performed, the recombinant baculoviruses infected the Tn-5B1-4 cells and EC-SOD was highly expressed in Tn-5B1-4 cells. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis revealed that the subunit molecular weight of the expression product is 28 kDa. Furthermore, recombinant human EC-SOD retains the enzymatic specific activity of 200 U/mg of the Tn-5B1-4 cell lysates.	2002 Feb	He Hua-Jun,Yuan Qin-Sheng,Yang Guan-Zhen,Wu Xiang-Fu	Protein expression and purification. 24(1) 13-7	Extracellular Superoxide Dismutase	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMWTGEDSAEPNSDSAEWIRDMYAKVTEIWQEVMQRRDDDGTLHAACQVQPSATLDAAQPRVTGVVLFRQLAPRAKLDAFFALEGFPTEPNSSSRAIHVHQFGDLSQGCESTGPHYNPLAVPHPQHPGDFGNFAVRDGSLWRYRAGLAASLAGPHSIVGRAVVVHAGEDDLGRGGNQASVENGNAGRRLACCVVGVCGPGLWERQAREHSERKKRRRESECKAA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P08294			7.4	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10686149	Optimization of inclusion body solubilization and renaturation of recombinant human growth hormone from Escherichia coli.	Recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. In 10 h of fed-batch fermentation, 1.6 g/L of r-hGH was produced at a cell concentration of 25 g dry cell weight/L. Inclusion bodies from the cells were isolated and purified to homogeneity. Various buffers with and without reducing agents were used to solubilize r-hGH from the inclusion bodies and the extent of solubility was compared with that of 8 M urea as well as 6 M Gdn-HCl. Hydrophobic interactions as well as ionic interactions were found to be the dominant forces responsible for the formation of r-hGH inclusion bodies during its high-level expression in E. coli. Complete solubilization of r-hGH inclusion bodies was observed in 100 mM Tris buffer at pH 12.5 containing 2 M urea. Solubilization of r-hGH inclusion bodies in the presence of low concentrations of urea helped in retaining the existing native-like secondary structures of r-hGH, thus improving the yield of bioactive protein during refolding. Solubilized r-hGH in Tris buffer containing 2 M urea was found to be less susceptible to aggregation during buffer exchange and thus was refolded by simple dilution. The r-hGH was purified by use of DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography and the pure monomeric r-hGH was finally obtained by using size-exclusion chromatography. The overall yield of the purified monomeric r-hGH was approximately 500f the initial inclusion body proteins and was found to be biologically active in promoting growth of rat Nb2 lymphoma cell lines.	2000 Mar	Patra A K,Mukhopadhyay R,Mukhija R,Krishnan A,Garg L C,Panda A K	Protein expression and purification. 18(2) 182-92	Growth Hormone	FPTIPLSRLFDNAMLRAHRLHQLAFDTYQEFEEAYIPKEQKYSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNREETQQKSNLELLRISLLLIQSWLEPVQFLRSVFANSLVYGASDSNVYDLLKDLEEGIQTLMGRLEDGSPRTGQIFKQTYSKFDTNSHNDDALLKNYGLLYCFRKDMDKVETFLRIVQCRSVEGSCGF		P01241			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8144550	Single amino acid substitutions of alpha 1-antitrypsin that confer enhancement in thermal stability.	A recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin variant which increased thermal stability was obtained from random mutagenesis followed by screening. The clone was identified as having a single mutation of Phe51--&gt;Cys. Heat deactivation of purified recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin produced in Escherichia coli revealed that the mutation slowed down the deactivation rate 10-fold at 57 degrees C, increasing thermal stability of recombinant protein to almost that of natural glycosylated plasma form. The mutant protein also exhibited increased stability against denaturant. The urea-induced unfolding monitored by the changes in fluorescence intensity at 360 nm showed that the mutation shifted midpoint of the transition from 1.9 M to 2.8 M. The mutation site is particularly interesting in that some genetic variants mapped at adjacent positions were shown previously to cause aggregation of the polypeptides, while the Phe51--&gt;Cys mutation decreased aggregation rate significantly during heat deactivation. The association rate constant with porcine pancreatic elastase revealed that the mutation did not affect inhibitory activity significantly. The site identified may be critical for regulating stability of alpha 1-antitrypsin. Characterization of various single amino acid substitutions at position 51 suggests that volume and flexibility of hydrophobic side chain at the site are critical factors for enhancing the stability of alpha 1-antitrypsin.	1994 Apr	Kwon K S,Kim J,Shin H S,Yu M H	The Journal of biological chemistry. 269(13) 9627-31	Alpha-1-Antitrypsin	DPQGDAAQKTDTSHHDQDHPTFNKITPNLAEFAFSLYRQLAHQSNSTNIFFSPVSIATAFAMLSLGTKADTHDEILEGLNFNLTEIPEAQIHEGFQELLRTLNQPDSQLQLTTGNGLFLSEGLKLVDKFLEDVKKLYHSEAFTVNFGDTEEAKKQINDYVEKGTQGKIVDLVKELDRDTVFALVNYIFFKGKWERPFEVKDTEEEDFHVDQVTTVKVPMMKRLGMFNIQHCKKLSSWVLLMKYLGNATAIFFLPDEGKLQHLENELTHDIITKFLENEDRRSASLHLPKLSITGTYDLKSVLGQLGITKVFSNGADLSGVTEEAPLKLSKAVHKAVLTIDEKGTEAAGAMFLEAIPMSIPPEVKFNKPFVFLMIEQNTKSPLFMGKVVNPTQK		P01009			6.5	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10850803	Role of Lys335 in the metastability and function of inhibitory serpins.	The native form of inhibitory serpins (serine protease inhibitors) is not in the thermodynamically most stable state but in a metastable state, which is critical to inhibitory functions. To understand structural basis and functional roles of the native metastability of inhibitory serpins, we have been characterizing stabilizing mutations of human alpha1-antitrypsin, a prototype inhibitory serpin. One of the sites that has been shown to be critical in stability and inhibitory activity of alpha1-antitrypsin is Lys335. In the present study, detailed roles of this lysine were analyzed by assessing the effects of 13 different amino acid substitutions. Results suggest that size and architect of the side chains at the 335 site determine the metastability of alpha1-antitrypsin. Moreover, factors such as polarity and flexibility of the side chain at this site, in addition to the metastability, seem to be critical for the inhibitory activity. Substitutions of the lysine at equivalent positions in two other inhibitory serpins, human alpha1-antichymotrypsin and human antithrombin III, also increased stability and decreased inhibitory activity toward alpha-chymotrypsin and thrombin, respectively. These results and characteristics of lysine side chain, such as flexibility, polarity, and the energetic cost upon burial, suggest that this lysine is one of the structural designs in regulating metastability and function of inhibitory serpins in general.	2000 May	Im H,Yu M H	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 9(5) 934-41	Alpha-1-Antichymotrypsin	HPNSPLDEENLTQENQDRGTHVDLGLASANVDFAFSLYKQLVLKAPDKNVIFSPLSISTALAFLSLGAHNTTLTEILKGLKFNLTETSEAEIHQSFQHLLRTLNQSSDELQLSMGNAMFVKEQLSLLDRFTEDAKRLYGSEAFATDFQDSAAAKKLINDYVKNGTRGKITDLIKDLDSQTMMVLVNYIFFKAKWEMPFDPQDTHQSRFYLSKKKWVMVPMMSLHHLTIPYFRDEELSCTVVELKYTGNASALFILPDQDKMEEVEAMLLPETLKRWRDSLEFREIGELYLPKFSISRDYNLNDILLQLGIEEAFTSKADLSGITGARNLAVSQVVHKAVLDVFEEGTEASAATAVKITLLSALVETRTIVRFNRPFLMIIVPTDTQNIFFMSKVTNPKQA	Mutants K337V and K337A also produced	P01011			6.5	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9177748	Reactivation of C1-inhibitor polymers by denaturation and gel-filtration chromatography.	C1-inhibitor is a proteinase inhibitor in the serpin family. It is an important inhibitor of complement C1, plasma kallikrein, and factor XIIa, and as such is involved in regulating inflammatory pathways. Studies on the plasma-derived protein are hampered by the relative ease with which the protein converts to an inactive state on storage, under mild denaturing conditions, or by incubating in some unfavorable buffers. This inactivation is caused by formation of soluble polymers which can be visualized on native electrophoresis. In order to facilitate studies on both the plasma-derived protein and recombinant variants planned for the future, it was necessary to devise a method for the rapid reactivation of the polymers in high yield. It was found that nonionic detergents did not dissociate the polymers, but they were readily dissociated in 0.1% SDS. Treatment with 0.1% SDS followed by rapid removal of the SDS and refolding on an FPLC Superose 6 column allowed for recovery of about 150f the protein in the active monomeric form. Eighty-five percent eluted as a range of higher order polymers. Using 8 M urea as the denaturant a 25% yield of active monomer was recovered. However, with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride as the denaturant, the yield of active monomer was almost 50%. The remaining material was not present as a range of polymeric species but was probably a dimer. Therefore this method is a useful technique to facilitate studies on C1-inhibitor. Moreover, the ability to produce monomer, dimer, and polymer forms of C1-inhibitor is useful for studies investigating the conformational changes which have occurred in the different forms.	1997 Jun	Gauthier M,Patston P A	Analytical biochemistry. 248(2) 228-33	C1-Inhibitor	NPNATSSSSQDPESLQDRGEGKVATTVISKMLFVEPILEVSSLPTTNSTTNSATKITANTTDEPTTQPTTEPTTQPTIQPTQPTTQLPTDSPTQPTTGSFCPGPVTLCSDLESHSTEAVLGDALVDFSLKLYHAFSAMKKVETNMAFSPFSIASLLTQVLLGAGENTKTNLESILSYPKDFTCVHQALKGFTTKGVTSVSQIFHSPDLAIRDTFVNASRTLYSSSPRVLSNNSDANLELINTWVAKNTNNKISRLLDSLPSDTRLVLLNAIYLSAKWKTTFDPKKTRMEPFHFKNSVIKVPMMNSKKYPVAHFIDQTLKAKVGQLQLSHNLSLVILVPQNLKHRLEDMEQALSPSVFKAIMEKLEMSKFQPTLLTLPRIKVTTSQDMLSIMEKLEFFDFSYDLNLCGLTEDPDLQVSAMQHQTVLELTETGVEAAAASAISVARTLLVFEVQQPFLFVLWDQQHKFPVFMGRVYDPRA		P05155			7.4	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12597900	One-step purification and refolding of recombinant photoprotein aequorin by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography.	A hexahistidine tag was fused to the N-terminus of apoaequorin. A suitable vector encoding the fusion protein was constructed and used for transformation of Escherichia coli JM109 cells. Apoaequorin was overexpressed under the control of tac promoter. It was found, however, that most of the protein existed in the form of inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies were solubilized with urea, followed by purification and refolding of (His)(6)-apoaequorin in a single chromatographic step by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography using Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose. The purity, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, was greater than 80%. The yield was 0.7-1 mg apoaequorin from a 50 ml bacterial culture. The kinetics of light emission of purified aequorin upon addition of Ca(2+) was typical of the commercial aequorin. The luminescence of the purified aequorin was a linear function of its concentration extending over six orders of magnitude. As low as 0.5 attomoles purified aequorin gave a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.8.	2003 Feb	Glynou Kyriaki,Ioannou Penelope C,Christopoulos Theodore K	Protein expression and purification. 27(2) 384-90	Aequorin	MHHHHHHVKLTPDFDNPKWIGRHKHMFNFLDVNHNGRISLDEMVYKASDIVINNLGATPEQAKRHKDAVEAFFGGAGMKYGVETEWPEYIEGWKRLASEELKRYSKNQITLIRLWGDALFDIIDKDQNGAISLDEWKAYTKSDGIIQSSEDCEETFRVCDIDESGQLDVDEMTRQHLGFWYTMDPACEKLYGGAVP	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P07164			7.8	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12034444	Refolding and structural characterization of the human p53 tumor suppressor protein.	The human tumor suppressor p53 is a conformationally flexible and functionally complex protein that is only partially understood on a structural level. We expressed full-length p53 in the cytosol of Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. To obtain active, recombinant p53, we varied renaturation conditions using DNA binding activity and oligomeric state as criteria for successful refolding. The optimized renaturation protocol allows the refolding of active, DNA binding p53 with correct quaternary structure and domain contact interfaces. The purified protein could be allosterically activated for DNA binding by addition of a C-terminally binding antibody. Analytical gelfiltration and chemical cross-linking confirmed the tetrameric quaternary structure and the spectroscopic analysis of renatured p53 by fluorescence and circular dichroism, suggested that native p53 is partially unstructured.	2002 May	Bell Stefan,Hansen Silke,Buchner Johannes	Biophysical chemistry. 96(2-3) 243-57	P53 tumor suppressor	MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQETFSDLWKLLPENNVLSPLPSQAMDDLMLSPDDIEQWFTEDPGPDEAPRMPEAAPPVAPAPAAPTPAAPAPAPSWPLSSSVPSQKTYQGSYGFRLGFLHSGTAKSVTCTYSPALNKMFCQLAKTCPVQLWVDSTPPPGTRVRAMAIYKQSQHMTEVVRRCPHHERCSDSDGLAPPQHLIRVEGNLRVEYLDDRNTFRHSVVVPYEPPEVGSDCTTIHYNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLEDSSGNLLGRNSFEVRVCACPGRDRRTEEENLRKKGEPHHELPPGSTKRALPNNTSSSPQPKKKPLDGEYFTLQIRGRERFEMFRELNEALELKDAQAGKEPGGSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKLMFKTEGPDSD		P04637			8	15	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11049743	Expression, purification, refolding, and characterization of recombinant human interleukin-13: utilization of intracellular processing.	Interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a pleiotropic cytokine that elicits both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses. Recent studies underscore its role in several diseases, including asthma and cancer. Solution studies of IL-13 and its soluble receptors may facilitate the design of antagonists/agonists which would require milligram quantities of specifically labeled protein. A synthetic gene encoding human IL-13 (hIL-13) was inserted into the pMAL-c2 vector with a cleavage site for the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. Coexpression of the fusion protein and TEV protease led to in vivo cleavage, resulting in high levels of hIL-13 production. hIL-13, localized to inclusion bodies, was purified and refolded to yield approximately 2 mg per liter of bacteria grown in minimal media. Subsequent biochemical and biophysical analysis of both the unlabeled and (15)N-labeled protein revealed a bioactive helical monomer. In addition, the two disulfide bonds were unambiguously demonstrated to be Cys29-Cys57 and Cys45-Cys71 by a combined proteolytic digestion and mass spectrometric analysis.	2000 Nov	Eisenmesser E Z,Kapust R B,Nawrocki J P,Mazzulla M J,Pannell L K,Waugh D S,Byrd R A	Protein expression and purification. 20(2) 186-95	Interleukin-13	GGPVPPSTALRELIEELVNITQNQKAPLCNGSMVWSINLTAGMYCAALESLINVSGCSAIEKTQRMLSGFCPHKVSAGQFSSLHVRDTKIEVAQFVKDLLLHLKKLFREGRFN	N-terminal maltose binding protein	P35225			8	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
11922755	Expression and refolding of recombinant human alpha-tocopherol transfer protein capable of specific alpha-tocopherol binding.	alpha-Tocopherol transfer protein (alpha-TTP) is a cytosolic protein found predominantly in mammalian liver that is proposed to be responsible for the stereoselective uptake of alpha-tocopherol from the diet. Although recombinant alpha-TTP has been reported previously, little detail has been provided about the yields and competency of the recovered protein at binding tocopherols and other ligands. In this work, we report the successful expression and refolding of a recombinant human alpha-TTP. Ligation-independent cloning generated a construct in pET-30 encoding an alpha-TTP fusion protein (pET-30/ttp) containing a six-histidine tag and an S-tag, each cleavable by a separate protease upon expression in Escherichia coli. Overexpression of the protein led to the formation of inclusion bodies that were solubilized in 8 M urea and purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography. Another construct in pET-28b (pET-28b/ttp) provided a soluble protein product after expression that contained a 40-amino-acid N-terminal extension, which can be reduced to 21 amino acids by cleavage with thrombin. The success of different refolding experiments was assessed using a Lipidex gel-based tocopherol binding assay. The best recovery of refolded recombinant alpha-TTP fusion capable of binding alpha-tocopherol was provided by matrix-assisted refolding in the presence of 0.5 M arginine. Cleavage of the fusion protein with Factor Xa successfully generated the full-length wild-type protein with no additional N-terminal amino acids. The resulting purification scheme provides recombinant alpha-TTP in good yield and purity for investigation of both its structure and its binding affinities for different ligands including natural and synthetic tocols.	2002 Apr	Panagabko Candace,Morley Samantha,Neely Steve,Lei Huangshu,Manor Danny,Atkinson Jeffrey	Protein expression and purification. 24(3) 395-403	Alpha-tocopherol transfer protein	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMASMTGGQQMGRGSEFELRRMAEARSQPSAGPQLNALPDHSPLLQPGLAALRRRAREAGVPLAPLPLTDSFLLRFLRARDFDLDLAWRLLKNYYKWRAECPEISADLHPRSIIGLLKAGYHGVLRSRDPTGSKVLIYRIAHWDPKVFTAYDVFRVSLITSELIVQEVETQRNGIKAIFDLEGWQFSHAFQITPSVAKKIAAVLTDSFPLKVRGIHLINEPVIFHAVFSMIKPFLTEKIKERIHMHGNNYKQSLLQHFPDILPLEYGGEEFSMEDICQEWTNFIMKSEDYLSSISESIQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag and Protein S peptide tag	P49638			7.6	14	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10973823	Expression of a kallikrein-like protease from the snake venom: engineering of autocatalytic site in the fusion protein to facilitate protein refolding.	In order to circumvent the difficulty encountered in the expression and purification of the recombinant products in E. coli system, we have developed a novel and facile method of removing the polyhistidine tag from target proteins after heterologous gene expression. The expression of a serine protease (Tm-5) from Taiwan habu (Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus) is taken as an exemplar to illustrate the basic rationales and protocols involved. In place of an enterokinase recognition site, a polyhistidine tag linked to an autocatalyzed site based on cleavage specificity of the serine protease flanking on the 5&#39;-end of Tm-5 clone sequence was engineered before protein expression in E. coli system. Renaturation of the fusion protein after expression revealed that the recombinant protease had refolded successfully from the inclusion bodies. Upon autocleavage of the expressed protease, the polyhistidine tag with additional amino acid residues appended to the N-terminus of the coding sequence is found to be removed accordingly. The protein expressed and purified by this new strategy possesses a molecular weight of approximately 28,000 in accord with the expected value for this venom protease. Further characterization of the recombinant protein employing a variety of techniques which include immunoblot analysis, RP-HPLC, ESI-MS, and N-terminal amino acid sequencing all shows indistinguishable properties to those of the isolated native protease. Most noteworthy is that the recombinant Tm-5 protease also exhibits amidase activity against N-benzoyl-Pro-Phe-Arg-p-nitroanilide, a unique and strict substrate for native Tm proteases reported previously.	2000 Sep	Hung C C,Chiou S H	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 275(3) 924-30	Mucrofibrase 1	MRGSVIGGDECNINEHPFLVLVYYDDYQCGGTLLNEEWVLTAAHCNGKDMEIYLGVHSKKVPNKDVQRRVPKEKFFCDSSKTYTKWNKDIMLIRLDRPVRKSAHIAPLSLPSSPPSVGSVCRVMGWGTITSPQETYPDVPHCANINLLDYEVCRAAYAGLPATSRTLCAGILEGGKDSCVGDSGGPLICNGQFQGIVSWGGDPCAQPREPGVCTNVFDHLDWIKGIIAGNTDVTCPL		Q91507			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10360984	Expression of a synthetic gene encoding canine milk lysozyme in Escherichia coli and characterization of the expressed protein.	A high-expression plasmid of the canine milk lysozyme, which belongs to the family of calcium-binding lysozymes, was constructed in order to study its physico-chemical properties. Because the cDNA sequence of the protein has not yet been determined, a 400 base-pair gene encoding canine milk lysozyme was first designed on the basis of the known amino acid sequence. The gene was constructed by an enzymatic assembly of 21 chemically synthesized oligonucleotides and inserted into an Escherichia coli expression vector by stepwise ligation. The expression plasmid thus constructed was transformed into BL21(DE3)/pLysS cells. The gene product accumulated as inclusion bodies in an insoluble fraction. Recombinant canine milk lysozyme was obtained by purification and refolding of the product and showed the same characteristics in terms of bacteriolytic activity and far- and near-UV circular dichroism spectra as the authentic protein. The NMR spectra of refolded lysozyme were also characteristic of a native globular protein. It was concluded that recombinant canine milk lysozyme was folded into the correct native structure. Moreover, the thermal unfolding profiles of the refolded recombinant lysozyme showed a stable equilibrium intermediate, indicating that the molten globule state of this protein was extraordinarily stable. This expression system of canine milk lysozyme will enable biophysical and structural studies of this protein to be extended.	1999 May	Koshiba T,Hayashi T,Miwako I,Kumagai I,Ikura T,Kawano K,Nitta K,Kuwajima K	Protein engineering. 12(5) 429-35	Lysozyme	MKIFSKCELARKLKSMGMDGFHGYSLANWVCMAEYESNFNTQAFNGRNSNGSSDYGIFQLNSKWWCKSNSHSSANACNIMCSKFLDDNIDDDIACAKRVVKDPNGMSAWVAWVKHCKGKDLSKYLASCNL		P81708			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14550647	Large scale production of biologically active Escherichia coli glutamyl-tRNA reductase from inclusion bodies.	Glutamyl-tRNA reductase catalyzes the initial step of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in plants and prokaryotes. Recombinant Escherichia coli glutamyl-tRNA reductase was purified to apparent homogeneity from an overproducing E. coli strain by a two-step procedure yielding 5.6 mg of enzyme per gram of wet cells with a specific activity of 0.47 micromol min(-1)mg(-1). After recombinant production, denatured glutamyl-tRNA reductase from inclusion bodies was renatured by an on-column refolding procedure. Residual protein aggregates were removed using Superdex 200 gel-filtration chromatography. Solubility, specific activity, and long-term storage properties were improved compared to previous protocols. Obtained enzyme amounts of high purity now allow the research on the recognition mechanism of tRNAGlu and high-throughput inhibitor screening.	2003 Oct	Schauer Stefan,Lüer Corinna,Moser Jürgen	Protein expression and purification. 31(2) 271-5	Glutamyl-tRNA reductase	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLGDMTLLALGINHKTAPVSLRERVSFSPDKLDQALDSLLAQPMVQGGVVLSTCNRTELYLSVEERDDLQEALIRWLCDYHNLNEDDLRNSLYWHQDNDAVSHLMRVASGLDSLVLGEPQILGQVKKAFADSQKGHMKASELERMFQKSFSVAKRVRTETDIGASAVSVAFAACTLARQIFESLSTVTVLLVGAGETIELVARHLREHKVQKMIIANRTRERAQILADEVGAEVIALSDIDERLREADIIISSTASPLPIIGKGMVERALKSRRNQPMLLVDIAVPRDVEPEVGKLANAYLYSVDDLQSIISHNLAQRKAAAVEAETIVAQEASEFMAWLRAQSASETIRDYRSQAEQVRDELTAKALAALEQGGDAQTIMQDLAWKLTNRLIHAPTKSLQQAARDGDNERLNILRDSLGLE	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8FI03			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11049739	Large-scale expression, refolding, and purification of the catalytic domain of human macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12) in Escherichia coli.	We have cloned, overexpressed, and purified the catalytic domain (residues Gly106 to Asn268) of human macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12) in Escherichia coli. This construct represents a truncated form of the enzyme, lacking the N-terminal propeptide domain and the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain. The overexpressed protein was localized exclusively to insoluble inclusion bodies, in which it was present as both an intact form and an N-terminally truncated form. Inclusion bodies were solubilized in an 8 M guanidine-HCl buffer and purified by gel filtration chromatography under denaturing conditions. Partial refolding of the protein by dialysis into a 3 M urea buffer caused selective degradation of the truncated form of the protein, while the intact catalytic domain was unaffected by proteolysis. An SP-Sepharose chromatography step purified the protein to homogeneity and served also to complete the refolding. The purified protein was homogeneous by mass spectrometry and had an activity similar to that of the recombinant enzyme purified from mammalian cells. The protein was both soluble and monodisperse at a concentration of 9 mg/ml. This purification procedure enables the production of 23 mg of protein per liter of E. coli culture and is amenable to large-scale protein production for structural studies.	2000 Nov	Parkar A A,Stow M D,Smith K,Panicker A K,Guilloteau J P,Jupp R,Crowe S J	Protein expression and purification. 20(2) 152-61	Macrophage Metalloelastase (MMP-12)	GPVWRKHYITYRINNYTPDMNREDVDYAIRKAFQVWSNVTPLKFSKINTGMADILVVFARGAHGDFHAFDGKGGILAHAFGPGSGIGGDAHFDEDEFWTTHSGGTNLFLTAVHEIGHSLGLGHSSDPKAVMFPTYKYVDINTFRLSADDIRGIQSLYGDPKEN		P39900		Catalytic domain aa.106-268	7.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12135557	High recovery of prochymosin from inclusion bodies using controlled air oxidation.	Refolding of proteins from inclusion bodies is a field of increasing interest for obtaining large amounts of active enzymes. Consequently, the development of inexpensive and scalable processes is required. This is particularly challenging in the case of eukaryotic proteins containing cysteines, which may form disulfide bonds in the native active protein. Previous studies have shown that the formation of disulfide bonds is essential for the refolding of prochymosin. In this work we demonstrate that air oxidation can be efficiently used for the refolding of prochymosin and that 480f the unfolded protein can be recovered as active enzyme at a final protein concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. Refolding of the protein strictly correlates with the change in pH of the refolding solution. We were able to follow the degree of oxidative renaturation of the prochymosin by simply measuring pH. Thus, the scaling up of the refolding system under controlled conditions was easily achieved. Analyses of different substances as folding aids indicate that the use of L-arginine or neutral surfactants improves the recovery of active protein up to 670f the initial protein. The overall results indicate that prochymosin can be efficiently and inexpensively refolded with high yields by controlled air oxidation.	2002 Jul	Menzella Hugo G,Gramajo Hugo C,Ceccarelli Eduardo A	Protein expression and purification. 25(2) 248-55	Prochymosin	MAEITRIPLYKGKSLRKALKEHGLLEDFLQKQQYGISSKYSGFGEVASVPLTNYLDSQYFGKIYLGTPPQEFTVLFDTGSSDFWVPSIYCKSNACKNHQRFDPRKSSTFQNLGKPLSIHYGTGSMQGILGYDTVTVSNIVDIQQTVGLSTQEPGDVFTYAEFDGILGMAYPSLASEYSIPVFDNMMNRHLVAQDLFSVYMDRNGQESMLTLGAIDPSYYTGSLHWVPVTVQQYWQFTVDSVTISDVVVACEGGCQAILDTGTSKLVGPSSDILNIQQAIGATQNQYGEFDIDCDNLSYMPTVVFEINGKMYPLTPSAYTSQDQGFCTSGFQSENHSQKWILGDVFIREYYSVFDRANNLVGLAKAI		P00794			10.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10733878	Overexpression, purification, and refolding of a Porphyromonas gingivalis cysteine protease from Escherichia coli.	This paper describes the overexpression of the Rgp-1 (arginine) protease domain from Porphyromonas gingivalis. This protease and the related Kgp (lysine) protease, both of which display trypsin-like specificity, have been implicated as major virulence factors and may play a significant role in the etiology of periodontal disease. Both Rgp-1 and Kgp are initially translated as polyproteins, each containing a protease domain and multiple adhesin domains. The Rgp-1 protease domain was expressed in E. coli, purified, refolded, and assayed for activity. These expression studies demonstrated that prior to the formation of inclusion bodies in the E. coli cytoplasm, the protease was proteolytically active and could hydrolyze a specific synthetic substrate. When the Rgp-1 protease domain was purified from inclusion bodies and refolded, it was found to be autolytically active and displayed specific catalytic activity. This is the first report on the expression and purification of active Rgp-1 from E. coli. Polyclonal antisera raised against recombinant protein recognized the native form of the protease in the P. gingivalis strain W50, indicating that the recombinant protein contained some of the antigenic determinants of the native protease.	2000 Apr	Margetts M B,Barr I G,Webb E A	Protein expression and purification. 18(3) 262-8	Arg specific Gingipain 1	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMASMTGGQQMGRGTPVEEKQNGRMIVIVAKKYEGDIKDFVDWKNQRGLRTEVKVAEDIASPVTANAIQQFVKQEYEKEGNDLTYVLLVGDHKDIPAKITPGIKSDQVYGQIVGNDHYNEVFIGRFSCESKEDLKTQIDRTIHYERNITTEDKWLGQALCIASAEGGPSADNGESDIQHENVIANLLTQYGYTKIIKCYDPGVTPKNIIDAFNGGISLVNYTGHGSETAWGTSHFGTTHVKQLTNSNQLPFIFDVACVNGDFLFSMPCFAEALMRAQKDGKPTGTVAIIASTINQSWASPMRGQDEMNEILCEKHPNNIKRTFGGVTMNGMFAMVEKYKKDGEKMLDTWTVFGDPSLLVRTLVPTKMQVTAPAQINLTDASVNVSCDYNGAIATISANGKMFGSAVVENGTATINLTGLTNESTLTLTVVGYNKETVIKTINTNGEPNPYQPVSNLTATTQGQKVTLKWDAPSTKTNATTNTARSVDGIRELVLLSVSDAPELLR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P28784			7.8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11162398	Refolding and purification of Bothropstoxin-I, a Lys49-phospholipase A2 homologue, expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.	Hydrolysis of phospholipids by Group II phospholipase A2 enzymes involves a nucleophilic attack on the sn-2 ester bond by the His48 residue and stabilization of the reaction intermediate by a Ca2+ ion cofactor bound to the Asp49 residue in the protein active site region. Bothropstoxin-I (BthTX-I) is a PLA(2) variant present in the venom of the snake Bothrops jararacussu which shows a Asp49 to Lys substitution and which lacks hydrolytic activity yet damages artificial membranes by a noncatalytic Ca2+-independent mechanism. In order to better characterize this unusual mechanism of membrane damage, we have established an expression system for BthTX-I in Escherichia coli. The DNA-coding sequence for BthTX-I was subcloned into the vector pET11-d, and the BthTX-I was expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21(DE3). The native BthTX-I contains seven disulfide bonds, and a straightforward protocol has been developed to refold the recombinant protein at high protein concentration in the presence of surfactants using a size-exclusion chromatography matrix. After refolding, recovery yields of 2.5% (corresponding to 4-5 mg of refolded recombinant BthTX-I per liter of bacterial culture) were routinely obtained. After refolding, identical fluorescent and circular dichroism spectra were obtained for the recombinant BthTX-I compared to those of the native protein. Furthermore, the native and refolded recombinant protein demonstrated identical membrane-damaging properties as evaluated by measuring the release of an entrapped fluorescent marker from liposomes.	2001 Feb	Ward R J,de Oliveira A H,Bortoleto R K,Rosa J C,Faça V M,Greene L J	Protein expression and purification. 21(1) 134-40	Bothropstoxin-I	MSLFELGKMILQETGKNPAKSHGAYGCNCGVLGRGKPKDATDRCCYVHKCCYKKLTGCDPKKDRYSYSWKDKTIVCGENNPCLKELCECDKAVAICLRENLGTYNKKYRYHLKPFCKKADAC		Q90249			8	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10480954	Generation of catalytically active granzyme K from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies and identification of efficient granzyme K inhibitors in human plasma.	Granzymes are granule-stored lymphocyte serine proteases that are implicated in T- and natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxic defense reactions after target cell recognition. A fifth human granzyme (granzyme 3, lymphocyte tryptase-2), renamed as granzyme K (gene name GZMK), has recently been cloned from lymphocyte tissue. For its further characterization we successfully generated catalytically active enzyme in milligram quantities per liter of Escherichia coli culture. The natural proform of granzyme K with the amino-terminal propeptide Met-Glu was expressed as inclusion bodies and converted to its active enzyme by cathepsin C after refolding of precursor molecules. Recombinant granzyme K cleaves synthetic thiobenzyl ester substrates after Lys and Arg with k(cat)/K(m) values of 3.7 x 10(4) and 4.4 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. Granzyme K activity was shown to be inhibited by the synthetic compounds Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, PefablocSC, and benzamidine, by the Kunitz-type inhibitor aprotinin and by human blood plasma. The plasma-derived inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor complex, its bikunin subunit, and the second carboxyl-terminal Kunitz-type domain of bikunin were identified as genuine physiologic inhibitors with K(i) values of 64, 50, and 22 nM, respectively. Inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor and free bikunin have the potential to neutralize extracellular granzyme K activity after T cell degranulation and may thus control unspecific damage of bystander cells at sites of inflammatory reactions.	1999 Sep	Wilharm E,Parry M A,Friebel R,Tschesche H,Matschiner G,Sommerhoff C P,Jenne D E	The Journal of biological chemistry. 274(38) 27331-7	Granzyme K	MEIIGGKEVSPHSRPFMASIQYGGHHVCGGVLIDPQWVLTAAHCQYRFTKGQSPTVVLGAHSLSKNEASKQTLEIKKFIPFSRVTSDPQSNDIMLVKLQTAAKLNKHVKMLHIRSKTSLRSGTKCKVTGWGATDPDSLRPSDTLREVTVTVLSRKLCNSQSYYNGDPFITKDMVCAGDAKGQKDSCKGDSGGPLICKGVFHAIVSGGHECGVATKPGIYTLLTKKYQTWIKSNLVPPHTN	first two residues ME constitute pro-region of Granzyme K.

10814596	Scale-up process for expression and renaturation of recombinant human epidermal growth factor from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies.	A cDNA encoding mature epidermal growth factor (EGF) was isolated and cloned into a pQE30 vector in which the His(6)-tagged EGF was expressed. pH-stat feeding of concentrated medium at the time of isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactoside induction and slug-feedings of the enriched medium during the induction resulted in a higher cell density and specific expression. Using a simple refolding protocol that consisted of 1 mM L-cysteine addition for a 1-h reduction followed by 5 mM L-cystine addition for oxidative refolding, we were able to convert nearly all EGF monomers into the oxidized form. Also, there folding aggregate was converted into the monomeric form. Approx. 500verall yield was obtained from the dissolved inclusion bodies to a single peak under FPLC. We hope that the result of this study may provide information that is useful for the scale-up of the recombinant human EGF production process.	2000 Jun	Lee J Y,Yoon C S,Chung I Y,Lee Y S,Lee E K	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 31 ( Pt 3) 245-8	Epidermal Growth Factor	NSDSECPLSHDGYCLHDGVCMYIEALDKYACNCVVGYIGERCQYRDLKWWELR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P01133			9.8	22	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2050673	Recombinant rhizopuspepsinogen. Expression, purification, and activation properties of recombinant rhizopuspepsinogens.	A cDNA clone, which contained the complete rhizopuspepsin structure and the putative proregion, was placed in three different Escherichia coli expression vectors for the synthesis of rhizopuspepsinogen (Rpg). Recombinant Rpgs which were expressed in the cytosol of E. coli as inclusion bodies (cRpg and tRpg) were not active. After solubilization in 6 M urea and refolding by rapid dilution, both of these Rpgs were purified to homogeneity. The third zymogen, pRpg, which was secreted to the periplasmic space of E. coli with an omp leader, was fully active and also was purified. The expression level of pRpg was higher (over 40 mg/liter culture) than that of cRpg (about 1.5 mg/liter culture). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the zymogens revealed that cRpg and pRpg contain 40 and 51 residues of prosequence, respectively. tRpg, which was expressed under the control of T7 promoter, was synthesized at 500 mg/liter culture and was purified at 50 mg/liter culture. This zymogen contained, in addition to 51 residues of proregion, 16 residues inherited from the expression vector construction. All of these Rpgs spontaneously converted to rhizopuspepsin in solutions of pH less than 5. Each of the conversions was associated with a change of molecular weight as monitored in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. At least one intermediate of conversion was observed in the pH range of 2 to 3 for both the cRpg and pRpg zymogens. For pRpg and tRpg, kinetic data demonstrated that the Rpg to rhizopuspepsin conversion was accomplished by a first order, unimolecular reaction at pH 2. The first order kinetic constants in this pH at 15 degrees C were 1.1 and 2.4 min-1 for pRpg and tRpg, respectively. The activation rate decreased as pH was raised above pH 2. At pH greater than 3.0, rhizopuspepsin-catalyzed, second-order activation also takes place. Consequently, the recombinant Rpgs are activated by either of two cleavage mechanisms as is the case for pepsinogen. These results also support the hypothesis that Rpg is synthesized in Rhizopus chinensis as a zymogen. Rpg in the host fungus is probably activated by an acid environment of pH less than 5 in the secretory granules to become rhizopuspepsin before secretion.	1991 Jun	Chen Z,Koelsch G,Han H P,Wang X J,Lin X L,Hartsuck J A,Tang J	The Journal of biological chemistry. 266(18) 11718-25	Rhizopuspepsinogen	PGEKKISIPLAKNPNYKPSAKNAIQKAIAKYNKHKINTSTGGIVPDAGVGTVPMTDYGNDVEYYGQVTIGTPGKKFNLDFDTGSSDLWIASTLCTNCGSRQTKYDPKQSSTYQADGRTWSISYGDGSSASGILAKDNVNLGGLLIKGQTIELAKREAASFANGPNDGLLGLGFDTITTVRGVKTPMDNLISQGLISRPIFGVYLGKASNGGGGEYIFGGYDSTKFKGSLTTVPIDNSRGWWGITVDRATVGTSTVASSFDGILDTGTTLLILPNNVAASVARAYGASDNGDGTYTISCDTSRFKPLVFSINGASFQVSPDSLVFEEYQGQCIAGFGYGNFDFAIIGDTFLKNNYVVFNQGVPEVQIAPVAQ		P06026			9	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

3038177	Characterization of disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins: reduced human interleukin 2 in inclusion bodies and its oxidative refolding.	Cloned cDNA of human interleukin 2 (IL-2) was expressed in Escherichia coli cells in which IL-2 formed insoluble inclusion bodies. Human IL-2 has three Cys residues, namely, Cys-58, Cys-105, and Cys-125, and native IL-2 has an intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys-58 and Cys-105. Since the formation of inclusion bodies was thought to be due to disorder in the oxidation state of these Cys residues, all intramolecular disulfide bond isomers of IL-2 were prepared by denaturation of native IL-2 to characterize the state of a disulfide bond in IL-2 in the inclusion bodies. These isomers can be separated from native IL-2, reduced IL-2, and IL-2&#39;s with intermolecular disulfide bonds by means of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Human IL-2 produced in inclusion bodies in E. coli carrying a recombinant DNA was analyzed by HPLC and was proved to be a fully reduced form with no intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds. Refolding of reduced IL-2 in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione and a low concentration of guanidine hydrochloride resulted in the formation of the biologically active IL-2 quantitatively. Further purification provided a practically pure IL-2 preparation without contamination of any disulfide bond isomers.	1987 Jun	Tsuji T,Nakagawa R,Sugimoto N,Fukuhara K	Biochemistry. 26(11) 3129-34	Interleukin-2	MYRMQLLSCIALSLALVTNSAPTSSSTKKTQLQLEHLLLDLQMILNGINNYKNPKLTRMLTFKFYMPKKATELKHLQCLEEELKPLEEVLNLAQSKNFHLRPRDLISNINVIVLELKGSETTFMCEYADETATIVEFLNRWITFCQSIISTLT		P60568			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11388810	Systematic optimization of expression and refolding of the Plasmodium falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2.	The Plasmodium falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2 is a potential new target for antimalarial chemotherapy. In order to obtain large quantities of active falcipain-2 for biochemical and structural analysis, a systematic assessment of optimal parameters for the expression and refolding of the protease was carried out. High-yield expression was achieved using M15(pREP4) Escherichia coli transformed with the pQE-30 plasmid containing a truncated profalcipain-2 construct. Recombinant falcipain-2 was expressed as inclusion bodies, solubilized, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. A systematic approach was then used to optimize refolding parameters. This approach utilized 100-fold dilutions of reduced and denatured falcipain-2 into 203 different buffers in a microtiter plate format. Refolding efficiency varied markedly. Optimal refolding was obtained in an alkaline buffer containing glycerol or sucrose and equal concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione. After optimization of the expression and refolding protocols and additional purification with anion-exchange chromatography, 12 mg of falcipain-2 was obtained from 5 liters of E. coli, and crystals of the protease were grown. The systematic approach described here allowed the rapid evaluation of a large number of expression and refolding conditions and provided milligram quantities of recombinant falcipain-2.	2001 Jun	Sijwali P S,Brinen L S,Rosenthal P J	Protein expression and purification. 22(1) 128-34	Pro-Falcipain-2	MRGSHHHHHHGKELNRFADLTYHEFKNKYLSLRSSKPLKNSKYLLDQMNYEEVIKKYRGEENFDHAAYDWRLHSGVTPVKDQKNCGSCWAFSSIGSVESQYAIRKNKLITLSEQELVDCSFKNYGCNGGLINNAFEDMIELGGICPDGDYPYVSDAPNLCNIDRCTEKYGIKNYLSVPDNKLKEALRFLGPISISVAVSDDFAFYKEGIFDGECGDELNHAVMLVGFGMKEIVNPLTKKGEKHYYYIIKNSWGQQWGERGFINIETDESGLMRKCGLGTDAFIPLIE	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9NBD4			9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9799718	A new derivatizing agent, trimethylammoniopropyl methanethiosulphonate, is efficient for preparation of recombinant brain-derived neurotrophic factor from inclusion bodies.	Derivatization with trimethylammoniopropyl methanethiosulphonate (TAPS-sulphonate) enabled brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) to be prepared efficiently from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. Reduced BDNF obtained from inclusion bodies solubilized by urea and reduced by dithiothreitol was suggested to form a complex with itself or with other compounds such as lipids. It could hardly be adsorbed on to cation-exchange resin for partial purification prior to a refolding reaction. Reversible derivatization of cysteine residues was tested as a method of dissociating BDNF from such complexes. However, even if a methyl or aminoethyl group was introduced, BDNF could not be dissociated readily. Derivatization with TAPS-sulphonate brought about good dissociation of BDNF, and more than 50% adsorbed on to the cation-exchange resin. BDNF derivatized with TAPS-sulphonate refolded well, and the refolded samples showed the same biological activity as purified BDNF. Derivatization with TAPS-sulphonate would increase the intermolecular repulsion of BDNF, due to the positively charged character of the quaternized amine, and inhibit complex formation. Thus, TAPS-sulphonate is effective for the preparation of BDNF under denatured conditions.	1998 Dec	Inoue M,Akimaru J,Nishikawa T,Seki N,Yamada H	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 28 ( Pt 3) 207-13	Brain-derived neurotrophic factor	APMKEANIRGQGGLAYPGVRTHGTLESVNGPKAGSRGLTSLADTFEHVIEELLDEDQKVRPNEENNKDADLYTSRVMLSSQVPLEPPLLFLLEEYKNYLDAANMSMRVRRHSDPARRGELSVCDSISEWVTAADKKTAVDMSGGTVTVLEKVPVSKGQLKQYFYETKCNPMGYTKEGCRGIDKRHWNSQCRTTQSYVRALTMDSKKRIGWRFIRIDTSCVCTLTIKRGR	approximated sequence only	P23560			9.8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12651027	On-column refolding of an insoluble histidine tag recombinant exopolyphosphatase from Trypanosoma brucei overexpressed in Escherichia coli.	An exopolyphosphatase gene has been cloned by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from Trypanosoma brucei and the corresponding protein overexpressed as a recombinant His-tag (histidine tag) exopolyphosphatase in E. coli in order to characterize its biochemical activity and to produce antibody to determine its localization. Because overexpression of this protein in bacteria resulted in the formation of inactive inclusion bodies, these structures were first solubilized in denaturant condition (6 M urea). Secondly, after a capture step using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), a gradual refolding of the protein was performed on-column from 6 M to 0 M urea in the presence of 1% Triton X-100.

11270657	Purification, refolding of hybrid hIFNgamma-kringle 5 expressed in Escherichia coli.	The DNA sequence coding for plasminogen kringle 5 (pK5), an inhibitor of angiogenesis, was fused with that coding for interferon gamma and over-produced in the form of inactive inclusion bodies in E. coli. The amount of fusion protein was about 400f total protein produced. The fusion protein contained in the inclusion bodies was solubilized in 8 M urea and purified by anion-exchange chromatography. We employed the orthogonal experimental design L16(4(5)) (5 factors, 4 levels, 16 experiments) procedure for researching the influence of denaturant, aggregation suppressor L-arginine, NaCl, pH, and glycine on the refolding procedure. Our results suggest that the presence of appropriate L-arginine, NaCl, and denaturant in the refolding buffer inhibits the aggregation of the fusion protein and increases the yield of renatured protein with biological activity. The refolded fusion protein, gammaIFN/pk5, has in vitro anti-endothelial cell proliferation activity.	2001 Mar	Lu H,Zhang H,Wang Q,Yuan H,He W,Zhao Z,Li Y	Current microbiology. 42(3) 211-6	Plasminogen	CMFGNGKGYRGKRATTVTGTPCQDWAAQEPHRHSIFTPETNPRAGLEKNYCRNPDGDVGGPWCYTTNPRKLYDYCDVPQC	N-terminal interferon gamma	P00747		Kringle 5 domain aa.481-560	9	26	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12531283	Expression and characterization of recombinant canine IL-13 receptor alpha2 protein and its biological activity in vitro.	Our previous study showed that recombinant canine IL-13 (rcaIL-13) stimulated production of allergen-specific IgE in vitro by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from flea allergen-sensitized dogs. This has also been demonstrated using human IL-13 (huIL-13) and PBMC isolated from human allergy patients. The stimulatory activity of rcaIL-13 was specifically inhibited by a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of canine IL-13Ralpha2 and the Fc fragment of canine IgG heavy chain (rcaIL-13Ralpha2-Fc). In this communication, we report the construction and expression of a non-fused recombinant extracellular domain of canine IL-13Ralpha2 (rcaIL-13Ralpha2) in an E. coli expression system. The E. coli expressed rcaIL-13Ralpha2 was isolated in inclusion bodies, then solubilized in buffer containing denaturants and reducing agents. After refolding and purification, the biological activity of rcaIL-13Ralpha2 was found in the monomer fraction resulting from gel filtration and ion exchange chromatographies. Biological activity of purified rcaIL-13Ralpha2 was demonstrated by the specific inhibition of rcaIL-13 activity in a TF-1 cell proliferation assay. Additionally, rcaIL-13Ralpha2 was found to be active in neutralizing rcaIL-13 induced upregulation of IgE mRNA levels in PBMCs of &quot;high IgE&quot; dogs, which have been bred to exhibit a predisposition for high IgE production and are used as a model for allergic asthma. The data confirm our previous report that the regulatory effects of IL-13 on IgE production in canine PBMCs are similar to those reported in humans. Thus, allergic dogs, such as the &quot;high IgE&quot; producing dogs, may be excellent models for research on IgE-mediated diseases in humans.	2003 Jan	Tang Liang,Morales Tony,Boroughs Karen L,Cailles Lo-Keiser Kathy,Sellins Karen,Stedman Kim,McCall Catherine,McDermott Martin J	Molecular immunology. 39(12) 719-27	Interleukin-13 receptor alpha-2	SMLSNAEIKVNPPQDFEIVDPGYLGYLSLQWQPPLFPDNFKECTIEYELKYRNIDSENWKTIITKNLHYKDGFDLNKGIEAKINTLLPAQCTNGSEVRSSWAETTYWTSPQGNRETKIQDMDCVYYNWQYLVCSWKPGMGVHFDTNYQLFYWYEGLDHSAECTDYIKVNGKNMGCRFPYLESSDYKDFYICVNGSSESQPIRPSYFIFQLQNIVKPMPPDYLSLTVKNSEEINLKWNMPKGPIPAKCFIYEIEFTEDGTTWVTTTVENEIQITRTSNESQKLCFLVRSKVNIYCSDDGIWSEWSDEQCWKGDIWKET		Q95LF0		Extracellular domain	10	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9882567	Production of leptin in Escherichia coli: a comparison of methods.	A procedure is described for gram-scale refolding of Escherichia coli-derived human leptin inclusion bodies. Refolding was achieved by gradually reducing denaturant using a diafiltration method. Refolded leptin is characterized by in vivo modulation of food intake, reduction in body weight, and lowering of insulin and glucose levels in ob/ob mice. In addition, refolded leptin is characterized by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and activation of the leptin receptor in a cell-based assay. For comparison we also refolded leptin by a simple dilution method and produced periplasmic derived leptin, which did not require ex vivo folding. Leptin produced by these three methods and leptin obtained from commercial sources were compared using the RIA and the cell-based assay and appeared to be of comparable quality and potency.	1998 Dec	Varnerin J P,Smith T,Rosenblum C I,Vongs A,Murphy B A,Nunes C,Mellin T N,King J J,Burgess B W,Junker B,Chou M,Hey P,Frazier E,MacIntyre D E,Van der Ploeg L H,Tota M R	Protein expression and purification. 14(3) 335-42	Leptin	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMVPIRKVQDDTKTLIKTIVTRINDISHTQSVSSKQRVTGLDFIPGLHPLLSLSKMDQTLAIYQQILASLPSRNVIQISNDLENLRDLLHLLAASKSCPLPQVRALESLESLGVVLEASLYSTEVVALSRLQGSLQDMLRQLDLSPGC	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q28603			7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9756741	Renaturation of recombinant human neurotrophin-3 from inclusion bodies using a suppressor agent of aggregation.	Escherichia coli has been widely used in the production of recombinant proteins. One of the drawbacks inherent in this method is that the proteins produced in the cells often form inactive inclusion bodies. Usually, the inclusion bodies can be separated from other cell components, solubilized by denaturants such as guanidine hydrochloride or urea, and then renatured through a refolding process such as dilution or dialysis. However, it has been shown that biologically active recombinant human neurotrophin-3 cannot be obtained at high yield by this procedure due to aggregation and precipitation of the protein. We applied the refolding process using the aggregation suppressor L-arginine in the renaturation of neurotrophin-3, and obtained biologically active neurotrophin-3 at high yield from the inclusion bodies. Consequently, about 10 mg of purified neurotrophin-3 was prepared from 1 litre of culture broth.	1998 Oct	Suenaga M,Ohmae H,Tsuji S,Itoh T,Nishimura O	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 28 ( Pt 2) 119-24	Neurotrophin-3	YAEHKSHRGEYSVCDSESLWVTDKSSAIDIRGHQVTVLGEIKTGNSPVKQYFYETRCKEARPVKNGCRGIDDKHWNSQCKTSQTYVRALTSENNKLVGWRWIRIDTSCVCAL		P20783			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7706290	High level expression and refolding of mouse interleukin 4 synthesized in Escherichia coli.	Mouse Interleukin 4 is a 20-kDa glycoprotein, synthesized by activated T lymphocytes and mast cells, which regulates the growth and/or differentiation of a broad spectrum of target cells of the immune system, including B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Using an inducible recA promoter and the g10-L ribosome-binding site, recombinant non-glycosylated interleukin 4 (IL-4) was expressed as 170f total cellular protein in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies, as a reduced, inactive 14.5-kDa polypeptide. The protein was refolded and aggregates dissociated when three disulfide bonds were reformed by slowly decreasing the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride and cysteine. The oxidized monomer was purified to homogeneity by sequential ion-exchange and size exclusion chromatography. When compared with native IL-4, E. coli-derived IL-4 displayed an identical specific activity of 4-7 x 10(7) units/mg. This recombinant IL-4 contained a three-amino-acid NH2-terminal extension, which did not affect its biological activity. Purified biologically active protein consisted of three isoforms as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, with a pI greater than 9.0. These data suggest that neither glycosylation nor the NH2 terminus of mouse IL-4 play a critical role in contributing to its in vitro biological activity.	1995 Mar	Levine A D,Rangwala S H,Horn N A,Peel M A,Matthews B K,Leimgruber R M,Manning J A,Bishop B F,Olins P O	The Journal of biological chemistry. 270(13) 7445-52	Interleukin-4	MTRSHIHGCDKNHLREIIGILNEVTGEGTPCTEMDVPNVLTATKNTTESELVCRASKVLRIFYLKHGKTPCLKKNSSVLMELQRLFRAFRCLDSSISCTMNESKSTSLKDFLESLKSIMQMDYS		P07750			9.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9084211	Method for increasing the yield of properly folded recombinant human gamma interferon from inclusion bodies.	A strategy is described for improved refolding and purification of recombinant human gamma interferon (rh-IFN gamma), which could warrant a higher yield and specific activity than reported previously. The optimal conditions of refolding are obtained by addition of a labilizing agent, L-arginine, in the refolding buffer. A 10-fold increase in the yield was observed with 0.5 M L-arginine, compared with renaturation in its absence. By varying renaturation parameters, the conditions that allow functional refolding of approximately 25-300f the recombinant protein have been standardized. A simple process is also described for the purification of rh-IFN gamma. The purification involves a single-column chromatography on S-Sepharose, after refolding of rh-IFN gamma in arginine containing buffer. This procedure has consistently produced rh-IFN gamma having a purity of at least 97%, the rest being the aggregated form of gamma interferon. The purified protein is a dimer under non-denaturing conditions and has a specific activity of 2 x 10(8) IU mg-1 protein, as measured by viral cytopathic assay.	1996 Dec	Arora D,Khanna N	Journal of biotechnology. 52(2) 127-33	Interferon gamma	MKYTSYILAFQLCIVLGSLGCYCQDPYVKEAENLKKYFNAGHSDVADNGTLFLGILKNWKEESDRKIMQSQIVSFYFKLFKNFKDDQSIQKSVETIKEDMNVKFFNSNKKKRDDFEKLTNYSVTDLNVQRKAIHELIQVMAELSPAAKTGKRKRSQMLFRGRRASQ		P01579			8	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Following refolding, proinsulin was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Combined peptide mapping and mass spectrometric analysis indicated that the proinsulin contained the correct disulfide bridging pattern. This proinsulin will be used to study the specificity of the furin/PC family of converting enzymes by using it as a substrate in a recently developed assay.	1997 Feb	Cowley D J,Mackin R B	FEBS letters. 402(2-3) 124-30	Proinsulin	MALWMRLLPLLALLALWGPDPAAAFVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKTRREAEDLQVGQVELGGGPGAGSLQPLALEGSLQKRGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P01308			6.8	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10024476	The refolding, purification, and activity analysis of a rice Bowman-Birk inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli.	A putative rice trypsin/chymotrypsin inhibitor of the Bowman-Birk family, RBBI-8 of about 20 kDa, was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein bearing an N-terminal (His)6 purification tag. The expressed recombinant protein, rRBBI-8, is insoluble and accumulates as inclusion bodies. The insoluble protein was solubilized in 8 M urea under reducing environment and then refolded into its active conformation under optimized redox conditions. Strategies used to optimize yield and efficiency include selecting the redox system, increasing protein concentration during refolding by adding the denatured protein in a stepwise way, utilizing additives to prevent aggregation, and selecting buffer-exchanging conditions. A Ni-chelate affinity column was then employed to purify the renatured protein. rRBBI-8 shows strong inhibitory activity against trypsin and it can slightly inhibit chymotrypsin. In this study, a refolding and purification system was set up for this cysteine-rich recombinant protein expressed in a prokaryotic system.	1999 Feb	Li N,Qu L J,Liu Y,Li Q,Gu H,Chen Z	Protein expression and purification. 15(1) 99-104	Bowman-Birk Inhibitor	MSNTTMATSTILLFLLAGLAAAHGDGDTTIRLPSDGAKASRPRAAKPWDCCDNIEISRLMIYPPLYRCNDEVKQCAAACKECVEAPGGDFNGGAFVCSDWFSTVDPGPKCTAALDGLSMERPWKCCDNIKRLPTKPDPPQWRCNDELEPSQCTAACKSCREAPGPFPGKLICEDIYWGADPGPFCTPRPWGDCCDKAFCNKMNPPTCRCMDEVKECADACKDCQRVESSEPPRYVCKDRFTGHPGPVCKPRAEN	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q0JR25			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10648164	In vitro refolding of heterodimeric CapZ expressed in E. coli as inclusion body protein.	CapZ is a heterodimeric Ca(2+)-independent actin binding protein which plays an important role in organizing the actin filament lattice of cross-striated muscle cells. It caps the barbed end of actin filaments and promotes nucleation of actin polymerization, thereby regulating actin filament length. Here we report the expression of the two muscle-specific isoforms alpha2 and beta1, from chicken in Escherichia coli as individual subunits using the pQE60 expression vector and the subsequent renaturation of the functional CapZ heterodimer from inclusion bodies. Optimal renaturation conditions were obtained both by simultaneous refolding of urea-solubilized subunits and by rapid dilution into a buffer containing 20 0lycerol, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, and 100 mM Tris, pH 7.4. The refolding mixture was incubated for 24 h at 15 degrees C and the protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration. Biochemical characterization of the recombinant heterodimer revealed actin binding activities indistinguishable from those of native CapZ as purified from chicken skeletal muscle. Using the same protocol, we were able to refold the beta1, but not the alpha2 isoform as a single polypeptide, indicating a role for beta1 as a molecular template for the folding of alpha2. The reported recombinant approach leads to high yields of active heterodimer and allows the renaturation and characterization of the beta subunit.	2000 Feb	Remmert K,Vullhorst D,Hinssen H	Protein expression and purification. 18(1) 11-9	CapZ alpha-2 subunit	MADLEEQLSDEEKVRIAAKFIIHAPPGEFNEVFNDVRLLLNNDNLLREGAAHAFAQYNLDQFTPVKIDGYDEQVLITEHGDLGNGKFLDPKNKISFKFDHLRKEATDPRPHEVENAIESWRNSVETAMKAYVKEHYPNGVCTVYGKTIDGQQTIIACIESHQFQAKNFWNGRWRSEWKFTISPSTTQVAGILKIQVHYYEDGNVQLVSHKDIQDSLTVSNEAQTAKEFIKIVEAAENEYQTAISENYQTMSDTTFKALRRQLPVTRTKIDWNKILSYKIGKEMQNA		P28497			7.4	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

9473466	Solubility of proteins isolated from inclusion bodies is enhanced by fusion to maltose-binding protein or thioredoxin.	When the mammalian aspartic proteinases, procathepsin D or pepsinogen, are expressed in Escherichia coli both accumulate in inclusion bodies. While pepsinogen is efficiently refolded in vitro, recovery of procathepsin D is limited by insolubility. We expressed procathepsin D and pepsinogen in E. coli, with E. coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) or thioredoxin (trx) fused to their C-termini (aspartic proteinase-MBP or aspartic proteinase-trx). The fusion proteins were still found in inclusion bodies. However, the recovery of soluble procathepsin D-MBP and procathepsin D-trx after refolding was facilitated by the bacterial fusion partners. Maltose-binding protein was more efficient than thioredoxin in increasing the recovery of soluble protein. The vector, pET23bMBPH6, can be used for general expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli. The vector includes a histidine tag at the C-terminus of MBP to allow one-step purification of the fusion proteins under denaturing conditions. After purification, the protein of interest can be cleaved from MBP with factor Xa protease and separated from the MBP partner. Refolded pepsinogen-MBP and pepsinogen-trx were enzymatically active, but procathepsin D-MBP and procathepsin D-trx were soluble but largely inactive. The results show that the limited recovery of activity upon refolding of procathepsin D is not the consequence of competing aggregation. Thus, the fusions do not necessarily facilitate native refolding, but they do enhance the recovery of soluble protein. Such fusions could provide a system to study, in soluble form, folding states which are otherwise inaccessible because of aggregation and precipitation.	1998 Feb	Sachdev D,Chirgwin J M	Protein expression and purification. 12(1) 122-32	ProCathepsin D	MQPSSLLPLALCLLAAPASALVRIPLHKFTSIRRTMSEVGGSVEDLIAKGPVSKYSQAVPAVTEGPIPEVLKNYMDAQYYGEIGIGTPPQCFTVVFDTGSSNLWVPSIHCKLLDIACWIHHKYNSDKSSTYVKNGTSFDIHYGSGSLSGYLSQDTVSVPCQSASSASALGGVKVERQVFGEATKQPGITFIAAKFDGILGMAYPRISVNNVLPVFDNLMQQKLVDQNIFSFYLSRDPDAQPGGELMLGGTDSKYYKGSLSYLNVTRKAYWQVHLDQVEVASGLTLCKEGCEAIVDTGTSLMVGPVDEVRELQKAIGAVPLIQGEYMIPCEKVSTLPAITLKLGGKGYKLSPEDYTLKVSQAGKTLCLSGFMGMDIPPPSGPLWILGDVFIGRYYTVFDRDNNRVGFAEAARL	C-terminal maltose binding protein	P07339			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7721861	Expression, refolding, and autocatalytic proteolytic processing of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme precursor.	The interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme is a heterodimeric cysteine protease that is produced as a 45-kDa precursor. The full-length precursor form of the enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies. Following solubilization and refolding of the 45-kDa protein, autoproteolytic conversion to a heterodimeric form containing 10- and 20-kDa subunits was observed. This enzyme had catalytic activity against both natural (interleukin-1 beta precursor) and synthetic peptide substrates. The inclusion of a specific inhibitor (SDZ 223-941) of the converting enzyme in the refolding mixture prevented proteolytic processing to the 10-/20-kDa form. Similarly, refolding under nonreducing conditions also prevented processing. Time course experiments showed that the 10-kDa subunit was released from the 45-kDa precursor before the 20-kDa subunit, implying that the N-terminal portion of the precursor is released last and may play a regulatory role.	1995 Apr	Ramage P,Cheneval D,Chvei M,Graff P,Hemmig R,Heng R,Kocher H P,Mackenzie A,Memmert K,Revesz L	The Journal of biological chemistry. 270(16) 9378-83	Interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme	MADKVLKEKRKLFIRSMGEGTINGLLDELLQTRVLNKEEMEKVKRENATVMDKTRALIDSVIPKGAQACQICITYICEEDSYLAGTLGLSADQTSGNYLNMQDSQGVLSSFPAPQAVQDNPAMPTSSGSEGNVKLCSLEEAQRIWKQKSAEIYPIMDKSSRTRLALIICNEEFDSIPRRTGAEVDITGMTMLLQNLGYSVDVKKNLTASDMTTELEAFAHRPEHKTSDSTFLVFMSHGIREGICGKKHSEQVPDILQLNAIFNMLNTKNCPSLKDKPKVIIIQACRGDSPGVVWFKDSVGVSGNLSLPTTEEFEDDAIKKAHIEKDFIAFCSSTPDNVSWRHPTMGSVFIGRLIEHMQEYACSCDVEEIFRKVRFSFEQPDGRAQMPTTERVTLTRCFYLFPGH		P29466			8	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9829968	Expression and renaturation of the N-terminal extracellular domain of torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha-subunit.	The N-terminal extracellular region (amino acids 1-209) of the alpha-subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) from Torpedo marmorata electric tissue was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli using the pET 3a vector. Employing a novel protocol of unfolding and refolding, in the absence of detergent, a water-soluble globular protein of 25 kDa was obtained displaying approximately 15% alpha-helical and 450eta-structure. The fragment bound alpha-[3H]bungarotoxin in 1:1 stoichiometry with a KD value of 0.5 nM as determined from kinetic measurements (4 nM from equilibrium binding). The kinetics of association of toxin and fragment were of second order, with a similar rate constant (8.2 x 10(5) M-1 s-1) as observed previously for the membrane-bound heteropentameric nAChR. Binding of small ligands was demonstrated by competition with alpha-[3H]bungarotoxin yielding the following KI values: acetylcholine, 69 microM; nicotine, 0.42 microM; anatoxin-a, 3 miroM; tubocurarine, 400 microM; and methyllycaconitine, 0.12 microM. The results demonstrate that the N-terminal extracellular region of the nAChR alpha-subunit forms a self-assembling domain that functionally expresses major elements of the ligand binding sites of the receptor.	1998 Dec	Schrattenholz A,Pfeiffer S,Pejovic V,Rudolph R,Godovac-Zimmermann J,Maelicke A	The Journal of biological chemistry. 273(49) 32393-9	Acetylcholine Receptor alpha-Subunit	SEHETRLVANLLENYNKVIRPVEHHTHFVDITVGLQLIQLINVDEVNQIVETNVRLRQQWIDVRLRWNPADYGGIKKIRLPSDDVWLPDLVLYNNADGDFAIVHMTKLLLDYTGKIMWTPPAIFKSYCEIIVTHFPFDQQNCTMKLGIWTYDGTKVSISPESDRPDLSTFMESGEWVMKDYRGWKHWVYYTCCPDTPYLDITYHFIMQRSGC		P02711		N-terminal extracellular domain aa.1-209	9.5	10	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Human retinol-binding protein (RBP) is a monomeric 21-kDa protein that is currently the subject of numerous studies owing to its role in the cellular uptake and utilization of retinol. When the RBP gene is overexpressed in Escherichia coli, inclusion bodies of aggregated RBP are found in the cells. These inclusion bodies are solubilized in 5.0 M GdmCl containing 10 mM DTT. Refolding of RBP is carried out in the presence of vitamin A by diluting denatured and reduced RBP into a redox refolding buffer consisting of 3 mM cysteine/0.3 mM cystine at 4 degreesC. Ion exchange chromatography (HPLC) is utilized to purify refolded RBP to homogeneity as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and electrospray MS. The native structure of refolded RBP was established by its ability to bind to vitamin A and the plasma protein transthyretin. The reconstitution of RBP outlined within affords a 50-600verall yield, i.e., 73 mg of pure RBP/L of E. coli culture.	1998 Oct	Xie Y,Lashuel H A,Miroy G J,Dikler S,Kelly J W	Protein expression and purification. 14(1) 31-7	Serum Retinol Binding Protein	MKWVWALLLLAALGSGRAERDCRVSSFRVKENFDKARFSGTWYAMAKKDPEGLFLQDNIVAEFSVDETGQMSATAKGRVRLLNNWDVCADMVGTFTDTEDPAKFKMKYWGVASFLQKGNDDHWIVDTDYDTYAVQYSCRLLNLDGTCADSYSFVFSRDPNGLPPEAQKIVRQRQEELCLARQYRLIVHNGYCDGRSERNLL		P02753			9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8185322	Isolation and refolding of H-ras from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli: refold procedure and comparison of refolded and soluble H-ras.	A refolding and purification method for economically producing large quantities of H-ras isolated from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies is described. Experiments were performed to optimize the yield of refolded H-ras for structural analysis by NMR spectroscopy. Protein concentration, temperature, and the presence of 10 0lycerol during refolding were varied. The yield of H-ras was highest when the protein was refolded at concentrations less than or equal to 0.1 mg/ml and was independent of the presence of 10 0lycerol. The yield was slightly higher at 4 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. The refolded H-ras was purified by anion exchange chromatography to yield protein with a purity of &gt; 90%, as determined by C4 reverse-phase HPLC, and a GDP-binding stoichiometry greater than 0.9. NMR structural analysis of refolded and soluble H-ras was conducted using [15N]glycine- and [15N]serine-enriched protein.

A chimeric form of hK4 (ch-hK4) was constructed in which the propiece of hK4 was replaced by that of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to create an activation site susceptible to trypsin-type proteases. ch-hK4 was expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated from inclusion bodies, refolded, and purified with an overall yield of 25%. The zymogen was readily self-activated during the refolding process to generate an active form (21 kDa) of hK4 (rhK4). rhK4 cleaved the chromogenic substrates Val-Leu-Arg-pNA (S-2266), Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (S-2302), Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA (S-2222), and Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (S-2251), indicating that rhK4 has a trypsin-type substrate specificity. The rhK4 was inhibited by aprotinin (6 kDa), forming an equimolar 27 kDa complex. rhK4 readily activated both the precursor of PSA (pro-PSA) and single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scuPA, pro-uPA). rhK4 also completely degraded prostatic acid phosphatase but failed to cleave serum albumin, another protein purified from human seminal plasma. These results indicate that hK4 may have a role in the physiologic processing of seminal plasma proteins such as pro-PSA, as well as in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer through its activation of pro-uPA.	2001 Dec	Takayama T K,McMullen B A,Nelson P S,Matsumura M,Fujikawa K	Biochemistry. 40(50) 15341-8	Kallikrein-4/Prostase	GSCSQIINGEDCSPHSQPWQAALVMENELFCSGVLVHPQWVLSAAHCFQNSYTIGLGLHSLEADQEPGSQMVEASLSVRHPEYNRPLLANDLMLIKLDESVSESDTIRSISIASQCPTAGNSCLVSGWGLLANGRMPTVLQCVNVSVVSEEVCSKLYDPLYHPSMFCAGGGQDQKDSCNGDSGGPLICNGYLQGLVSFGKAPCGQVGVPGVYTNLCKFTEWIEKTVQAS	hK4 (prostase, KLK4), a recently cloned prostate-specific serine protease and a member of the tissue kallikrein family, is a zymogen composed of 228 amino acid residues including an amino-terminal propiece, Ser-Cys-Ser-Gln-.

9409760	Human prion proteins expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by high-affinity column refolding.	An efficient method is presented for the production of intact mammalian prion proteins and partial sequences thereof. As an illustration we describe the production of polypeptides comprising residues 23-231, 81-231, 90-231 and 121-231 of the human prion protein (hPrP). Polypeptides were expressed as histidine tail fusion proteins into inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and refolded and oxidized while N-terminally immobilized on a nickel-NTA agarose resin. This &#39;high-affinity column refolding&#39; facilitates the preparation of prion proteins by preventing protein aggregation and intermolecular disulfide formation. After elution from the resin the histidine tail can be removed using thrombin without cleaving the prion protein polypeptide chain. The same protocol as used here for hPrP has been successfully applied with bovine and murine prion proteins. The protein preparations are stable for weeks at room temperature in concentrated solution and are thus suitable for detailed structural studies. Preliminary biophysical characterization of hPrP(23-231) suggests that the C-terminal half of the polypeptide chain forms a well-structured globular domain, and that the N-terminal half does not form extensive regular secondary structures.	1997 Nov	Zahn R,von Schroetter C,Wüthrich K	FEBS letters. 417(3) 400-4	Prion	MANLGCWMLVLFVATWSDLGLCKKRPKPGGWNTGGSRYPGQGSPGGNRYPPQGGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQGGGTHSQWNKPSKPKTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPIIHFGSDYEDRYYRENMHRYPNQVYYRPMDEYSNQNNFVHDCVNITIKQHTVTTTTKGENFTETDVKMMERVVEQMCITQYERESQAYYQRGSSMVLFSSPPVILLISFLIFLIVG	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P04156			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9325143	Optimized gene synthesis, high level expression, isotopic enrichment, and refolding of human interleukin-5.	Structural studies on soluble proteins using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and other structural methods in general require large quantities of isotopically enriched proteins. Human interleukin-5 is a disulfide-linked homodimeric cytokine implicated in asthmatic response. The development of a high yield overexpression system for human interleukin-5 is an important prerequisite to using modern multidimensional NMR in the characterization of the solution structure of the protein and to characterize interactions with a soluble receptor domain. Significant amounts of the protein were expressed using an optimized synthetic gene in a high yield expression system. Gene synthesis was accomplished through the ligation of six oligonucleotides composed of optimized codons. The ligated fragments were further amplified by a polymerase chain reaction and then subcloned into the T7 RNA polymerase based overexpression vector pET11a. However, the induced protein accumulated in the form of inclusion bodies. Initially, the protein was solubilized under denaturing conditions and purified in these denaturing conditions by passage through a single S-200 HR sizing column. Finally, protein refolding was initiated in the presence of 2 M urea followed by dialysis. This protocol yielded 40 mg of biologically active, isotope-enriched protein from 4 liters of minimal medium thus facilitating structural studies by NMR. The strategy described may be of immense value in the production of significant quantities of recombinant, eukaryotic proteins for structural and other studies.	1997 Oct	Mehta D V,DiGate R J,Banville D L,Guiles R D	Protein expression and purification. 11(1) 86-94	Interleukin-5	MRMLLHLSLLALGAAYVYAIPTEIPTSALVKETLALLSTHRTLLIANETLRIPVPVHKNHQLCTEEIFQGIGTLESQTVQGGTVERLFKNLSLIKKYIDGQKKKCGEERRRVNQFLDYLQEFLGVMNTEWIIES		P05113			8.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9268684	Cloning, overexpression, refolding, and purification of the nonspecific phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus.	Bacillus cereus secretes a nonspecific phospholipase C (PLC) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids to yield diacylglycerol and a phosphate monoester. B. cereus PLC has been overexpressed with its signal sequence in Escherichia coli using a T7 expression system. The expressed enzyme formed intracellular inclusion bodies which were solubilized in the presence of 8 M urea. Renaturation was initiated by gradual removal of urea and addition of zinc ions. The signal peptide was specifically cleaved by a protease, clostripain, added when the urea concentration was 1.5 M. Factors that led to protein reaggregation included rapid removal of urea, use of Tris instead of barbital buffer, and presence of the signal peptide when the urea concentration was below 1.5 M. The folded protein was purified by Q-Sepharose Fast flow chromatography to yield a preparation &gt; 99d0c850ure. The final yield of active enzyme was 30-40 mg per liter of culture. The recombinant PLC exhibited biochemical and kinetic properties identical to those of extracellularly produced PLC from B. cereus. Site-specific mutagenesis of Asn-134 was carried out as a test of the general effectiveness of the refolding procedure.	1997 Aug	Tan C A,Hehir M J,Roberts M F	Protein expression and purification. 10(3) 365-72	Phospholipase C	MKKKVLALAAAITVVAPLQSVAFAHENDGGSKIKIVHRWSAEDKHKEGVNSHLWIVNRAIDIMSRNTTLVKQDRVAQLNEWRTELENGIYAADYENPYYDNSTFASHFYDPDNGKTYIPFAKQAKETGAKYFKLAGESYKNKDMKQAFFYLGLSLHYLGDVNQPMHAANFTNLSYPQGFHSKYENFVDTIKDNYKVTDGNGYWNWKGTNPEEWIHGAAVVAKQDYSGIVNDNTKDWFVKAAVSQEYADKWRAEVTPMTGKRLMDAQRVTAGYIQLWFDTYGDR		P09598			7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11388806	Refolding and purification of yeast carboxypeptidase Y expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.	The genes encoding carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and CPY propeptide (CPYPR) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Six consecutive histidine residues were fused to the C-terminus of the CPYPR for facilitated purification. High-level expression of CPY and CPYPR-His(6) was achieved but most of the expressed proteins were present in the form of inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytoplasm. The CPY and CPYPR-His(6) produced as inclusion bodies were separated from the cells and solubilized in 6 and 3 M guanidinium chloride, respectively. The denatured CPYPR-His(6) was refolded by dilution 1:30 into the renaturation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl containing 0.5 M NaCl and 3 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the refolded CPYPR-His(6) was further purified to 90d0c850urity by single-step immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The denatured CPY was refolded by dilution 1:60 into the renaturation buffer containing CPYPR-His(6) at various concentrations. Increasing the molar ratio of CPYPR-His(6) to CPY resulted in an increase in the CPY refolding yield, indicating that the CPYPR-His(6) plays a chaperone-like role in in vitro folding of CPY. The refolded CPY was purified to 92d0c850urity by single-step p-aminobenzylsuccinic acid affinity chromatography. When refolding was carried out in the presence of 10 molar eq CPYPR-His(6), the specific activity, N-(2-furanacryloyl)-l-phenylalanyl-l-phenylalanine hydrolysis activity per milligram of protein, of purified recombinant CPY was found to be about 630f that of native S. cerevisiae CPY.	2001 Jun	Hahm M S,Chung B H	Protein expression and purification. 22(1) 101-7	Carboxypeptidase Y	MKLSKSTLIATLALTATSTNALVVQNPFSNIQQALKLDLSYDKLTSKLTDTFEQGKANIISTIAKVMNEPLDGLTPEIKNIWSEMLMKFPNSITELNFKAPPKKGKITTQQFDFHVTDAQVPNHKLRIKSTPKDLGIDTVKQYSGYLDVVDEDKHFFYYFFESRNDPKNDPVILWLNGGPGCSSLTGLFFELGPSSIDKNLKPVYNPHSWNANASVIFLDQPINVGYSYSSQSVSNTIAAGKDVYAFLQLFFKNFPEYANLDFHIAGESYAGHYIPAFASEILTHPERNFNLTSVLIGNGLTDPLVQYEYYEPMACGEGGEPSVLEPEECDGMLNSLPRCLSLIESCYESGSVWSCVPATIYCNNGQMGPYQKTGRNVYDIRTMCEGSSLCYSQLEYIDQYLNLPEVKKALGAEVDEYQSCNFDINRNFMFAGDWMKPYQKNVIDLLEKELPVLIYAGDKDFICNWLGNQAWTNRLEWSGSKGFTKAPVKSWKVGKNAAGEVKNYKHFTFLRVFGGGHMVPYDQPENALDMVNRWISGDYKY		P30574			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10910725	Purification of the Caenorhabditis elegans transposase Tc1A refolded during gel filtration chromatography.	Full-length recombinant transposase Tc1A from Caenorhabditis elegans (343 amino acids) expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 in inclusion bodies has been purified in a high yield in a soluble form. The procedure includes denaturation of the inclusion bodies followed by refolding of the Tc1A protein by gel filtration. This last step is absolutely crucial to give a high yield of soluble and active protein since it allows the physical separation of the aggregates from intermediates that give rise to correctly refolded protein. This step is very sensitive to the concentration of protein. Good yields of refolded protein are obtained by refolding 2 to 12 mg of denatured protein. The other purification steps involve the initial use of gel filtration under denaturing conditions and a final step of ion-exchange chromatography. Biological activity of the purified protein was confirmed in an in vitro transposon excision assay and its DNA-binding capacity by UV crosslinking. This new Tc1A purification procedure gives a yield of 12-16 mg/liter E. coli culture, in a form suitable for crystallization studies.	2000 Aug	García-Sáez I,Plasterk R H	Protein expression and purification. 19(3) 355-61	Transposase Tc1A	MDRNILRSAREDPHRTATDIQMIISSPNEPVPSKRTVRRRLQQAGLHGRKPVKKPFISKKNRMARVAWAKAHLRWGRQEWAKHIWSDESKFNLFGSDGNSWVRRPVGSRYSPKYQCPTVKHGGGSVMVWGCFTSTSMGPLRRIQSIMDRFQYENIFETTMRPWALQNVGRGFVFQQDNDPKHTSLHVRSWFQRRHVHLLDWPSQSPDLNPIEHLWEELERRLGGIRASNADAKFNQLENAWKAIPMSVIHKLIDSMPRRCQAVIDANGYATKY		P03934			5.5	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8380419	Purification and characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase delta overproduced in Escherichia coli.	In order to further define the enzymatic properties of yeast DNA polymerase delta, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae POL3 gene, whose expression is highly toxic to bacteria in most cloning vectors, was cloned into a new T7 expression vector (W. C. Brown and J. L. Campbell, submitted for publication) which allowed efficient overexpression in bacteria. Fifteen mg of polymerase were obtained from 3 g of cells. Since the protein is produced in insoluble form, to obtain active polymerase, inclusion bodies were solubilized with urea. DNA polymerase delta (124 kDa) was purified in the presence of urea and then renatured by dialysis against buffers containing decreasing concentrations of urea. Optimal protein concentration for refolding was 5 micrograms/ml. By several criteria the enzyme obtained is comparable with that from yeast: specific activity, electrophoretic mobility, template preference, sensitivity to inhibitors, and processivity. The electrophoretic mobility suggests that, unlike DNA polymerase alpha, polymerase delta is not posttranslationally modified in yeast. Polyclonal antibody was raised against the full-length DNA polymerase delta from bacteria and shown to cross-react with the protein purified from yeast on protein blots. The renatured protein also exhibits an exonucleolytic activity. Further examination of this nuclease determined it to be a 3&#39; to 5&#39; exonuclease with the characteristics of a proofreading activity. The presence of this nuclease in the highly purified bacterial polymerase provides biochemical confirmation of earlier genetic evidence (Simon, M., Giot, L., and Faye, G. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 2165-2170) that suggested that DNA polymerase delta&#39;s core catalytic subunit contains an intrinsic 3&#39; to 5&#39; exonuclease.	1993 Jan	Brown W C,Duncan J A,Campbell J L	The Journal of biological chemistry. 268(2) 982-90	DNA Polymerase Delta	MSEKRSLPMVDVKIDDEDTPQLEKKIKRQSIDHGVGSEPVSTIEIIPSDSFRKYNSQGFKAKDTDLMGTQLESTFEQDVSQMEHDMADQEEHDLSSFERKKLPTDFDPSLYDISFQQIDAEQSVLNGIKDENTSTVVRFFGVTSEGHSVLCNVTGFKNYLYVPAPNSSDANDQEQINKFVHYLNETFDHAIDSIEVVSKQSIWGYSGDTKLPFWKIYVTYPHMVNKLRTAFERGHLSFNSWFSNGTTTYDNIAYTLRLMVDCGIVGMSWITLPKGKYSMIEPNNRVSSCQLEVSINYRNLIAHPAEGDWSHTAPLRIMSFDIECAGRIGVFPEPEYDPVIQIANVVSIAGAKKPFIRNVFTLNTCSPITGSMIFSHATEEEMLSNWRNFIIKVDPDVIIGYNTTNFDIPYLLNRAKALKVNDFPYFGRLKTVKQEIKESVFSSKAYGTRETKNVNIDGRLQLDLLQFIQREYKLRSYTLNAVSAHFLGEQKEDVHYSIISDLQNGDSETRRRLAVYCLKDAYLPLRLMEKLMALVNYTEMARVTGVPFSYLLARGQQIKVVSQLFRKCLEIDTVIPNMQSQASDDQYEGATVIEPIRGYYDVPIATLDFNSLYPSIMMAHNLCYTTLCNKATVERLNLKIDEDYVITPNGDYFVTTKRRRGILPIILDELISARKRAKKDLRDEKDPFKRDVLNGRQLALKISANSVYGFTGATVGKLPCLAISSSVTAYGRTMILKTKTAVQEKYCIKNGYKHDAVVVYGDTDSVMVKFGTTDLKEAMDLGTEAAKYVSTLFKHPINLEFEKAYFPYLLINKKRYAGLFWTNPDKFDKLDQKGLASVRRDSCSLVSIVMNKVLKKILIERNVDGALAFVRETINDILHNRVDISKLIISKTLAPNYTNPQPHAVLAERMKRREGVGPNVGDRVDYVIIGGNDKLYNRAEDPLFVLENNIQVDSRYYLTNQLQNPIISIVAPIIGDKQANGMFVVKSIKINTGSQKGGLMSFIKKVEACKSCKGPLRKGEGPLCSNCLARSGELYIKALYDVRDLEEKYSRLWTQCQRCAGNLHSEVLCSNKNCDIFYMRVKVKKELQEKVEQLSKW		P15436			7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9644594	The phage lambda terminase enzyme: 1. Reconstitution of the holoenzyme from the individual subunits enhances the thermal stability of the small subunit.	The terminase enzyme from bacteriophage lambda is a hetero-trimeric complex composed of the viral gpA and gpNu1 proteins (gpA1.gpNu1(2)) and is responsible for packaging a single genome within the viral capsid. Current expression systems for these proteins require thermal induction which may be responsible for the formation of insoluble aggregates observed in E. coli. We report the re-cloning of the terminase subunits into vectors which allow low temperature induction. While this has resulted in increased solubility of the large gpA subunit of the enzyme, the small gpNu1 subunit remains insoluble under all conditions examined. This paper describes the solublization of gpNu1 with guanidinium hydrochloride and purification of the protein to homogeneity. Reconstitution of the enzyme from the individually purified subunits yields a catalytically-competent complex which exhibits activity identical to wild-type enzyme. Thermal denaturation of the proteins was monitored by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and demonstrates that while unfolding of gpA is irreversible, the gpNu1 subunit refolds into a conformation which is essentially identical to the pre-heated protein. Moreover, while denaturation of gpA is highly cooperative, the small subunit unfolds over a wide temperature range and with thermodynamic parameters lower than expected for a small globular protein. Thermally-induced denaturation of the enzyme reconstituted from the individual subunits is highly cooperative with no evidence of multiple transitions. Our data demonstrate that the terminase subunits directly interact in solution, and that this interaction alters the thermal stability of the smaller gpNu1 subunit. The implication of these results with respect to assembly of a catalytically competent enzyme complex are discussed.	1998 Jul	Meyer J D,Hanagan A,Manning M C,Catalano C E	International journal of biological macromolecules. 23(1) 27-36	Phage lambda terminase enzyme	MEVNKKQLADIFGASIRTIQNWQEQGMPVLRGGGKGNEVLYDSAAVIKWYAERDAEIENEKLRREVEELRQASEADLQPGTIEYERHRLTRAQADAQELKNARDSAEVVETAFCTFVLSRIAGEIASILDGLPLSVQRRFPELENRHVDFLKRDIIKAMNKAAALDELIPGLLSEYIEQSG		P03707			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1645734	Construction of deletion mutants of the Escherichia coli UvrA protein and their purification from inclusion bodies.	The functions of each of the three subunits of the damage-specific UvrABC endonuclease is currently being studied by systematically mutagenizing the corresponding genes to generate mutant proteins for characterization in vitro. In this communication, we describe the construction of C-terminal deletion mutants of the UvrA protein and a procedure to purify the mutant and wild-type UvrA proteins from inclusion bodies in cells overexpressing the recombinant proteins. The method yields highly purified proteins with between 10 and 500f the specific activity of wild-type UvrA purified by conventional techniques from the soluble fraction. The wild-type UvrA protein purified by this method had the properties of significant and selective loss of activity in assays of incision of damaged DNA, while still retaining high levels of the other unique molecular phenotypic properties associated with intact UvrA. Furthermore, the demonstration of the absolute requirement for zinc during refolding for recovery of activity is the first evidence that the zinc previously shown to be associated with the UvrA protein is in fact a necessary component for its function.	1991 Jun	Claassen L A,Ahn B,Koo H S,Grossman L	The Journal of biological chemistry. 266(17) 11380-7	UvrA Protein	MDKIEVRGARTHNLKNINLVIPRDKLIVVTGLSGSGKSSLAFDTLYAEGQRRYVESLSAYARQFLSLMEKPDVDHIEGLSPAISIEQKSTSHNPRSTVGTITEIHDYLRLLFARVGEPRCPDHDVPLAAQTVSQMVDNVLSQPEGKRLMLLAPIIKERKGEHTKTLENLASQGYIRARIDGEVCDLSDPPKLELQKKHTIEVVVDRFKVRDDLTQRLAESFETALELSGGTAVVADMDDPKAEELLFSANFACPICGYSMRELEPRLFSFNNPAGACPTCDGLGVQQYFDPDRVIQNPELSLAGGAIRGWDRRNFYYFQMLKSLADHYKFDVEAPWGSLSANVHKVVLYGSGKENIEFKYMNDRGDTSIRRHPFEGVLHNMERRYKETESSAVREELAKFISNRPCASCEGTRLRREARHVYVENTPLPAISDMSIGHAMEFFNNLKLAGQRAKIAEKILKEIGDRLKFLVNVGLNYLTLSRSAETLSGGEAQRIRLASQIGAGLVGVMYVLDEPSIGLHQRDNERLLGTLIHLRDLGNTVIVVEHDEDAIRAADHVIDIGPGAGVHGGEVVAEGPLEAIMAVPESLTGQYMSGKRKIEVPKKRVPANPEKVLKLTGARGNNLKDVTLTLPVGLFTCITGVSGSGKSTLINDTLFPIAQRQLNGATIAEPAPYRDIQGLEHFDKVIDIDQSPIGRTPRSNPATYTGVFTPVRELFAGVPESRARGYTPGRFSFNVRGGRCEACQGDGVIKVEMHFLPDIYVPCDQCKGKRYNRETLEIKYKGKTIHEVLDMTIEEAREFFDAVPALARKLQTLMDVGLTYIRLGQSATTLSGGEAQRVKLARELSKRGTGQTLYILDEPTTGLHFADIQQLLDVLHKLRDQGNTIVVIEHNLDVIKTADWIVDLGPEGGSGGGEILVSGTPETVAECEASHTARFLKPML		P0A698			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

10873534	Refolding and characterization of rat liver methionine adenosyltransferase from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies.	Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, the major methyl donor for transmethylation reactions. Attempts to perform structural studies using rat liver MAT have met with problems because the protein purified from cellular extracts is heterogeneous. Overexpression of the enzyme in Escherichia coli rendered most of the protein as inclusion bodies. These aggregates were purified by specific washes using urea and Triton X-100 and used for refolding. Maximal activity was obtained when chaotropic solubilization included the structural cation Mg(2+), the protein concentration was kept below 0.1 mg/ml, and denaturant removal was carried out in a two-step process, namely, a fast dilution followed by dialysis in the presence of 10 mM DTT or GSH/GSSG redox buffers. Refolding by this procedure generated the oligomeric forms, MAT I and III, which were basically indistinguishable from the purified rat liver forms in secondary structure and catalytic properties.	2000 Jul	López-Vara M C,Gasset M,Pajares M A	Protein expression and purification. 19(2) 219-26	Methionine Adenosyltransferase	MNGQLNGFHEAFIEEGTFLFTSESVGEGHPDKICDQINDAVLDAHLQQDPDAKVACETVAKTGMILLAGEITSRAAIDYQKVVREAIKHIGYDDSSKGFDYKTCNVLVALEQQSPDIAQGVHLDRNEEDIGAGDQGLMFGYATDETEECMPLTIVLAHKLNAKLAELRRNGTLPWLRPDSKTQVTVQYMQDRGAVIPIRVHTIVISVQHDEEVCLDEMRDALKEKLIKAVVPAKYLDEDTIYHLQPSGRFVIGGPQGDAGLTGRKIIVDTYGGWGAHGGGAFSGKDYTKVDRSAAYAARWVAKSLVKGGLCRRVLVQVSYAIGVSHPLSISIFHYGTSQKSERELLEIVKNNFDLRPGVIVRDLDLKKPIYQRTAAYGHFGRDSFPWEVPKKLKY		P18298			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7849045	Overproduction and characterization of the erythromycin C-12 hydroxylase, EryK.	Hydroxylation of C-12 is one of the final steps in the biosynthesis of erythromycin A (ErA). A point of uncertainty in the erythromycin pathway has been whether the C-12 hydroxylase operates on each of two possible substrates, erythromycin B (ErB) and erythromycin D (ErD). Stassi et al. have cloned the gene, designated eryK, which encodes the P-450 monooxygenase responsible for erythromycin C-12 hydroxylation in Saccharopolyspora erythraea [Stassi, D., Donadio, S., Staver, M. J., &amp; Katz, L. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 182-189]. We report the overproduction of EryK in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies; the solubilization, refolding, and reconstitution of active holo-EryK; and kinetic confirmation of a 1200-1900-fold preference of the enzyme for ErD over the alternative C-12 hydroxylase substrate ErB.

10733894	Refolding and purification of Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase produced as inclusion bodies in fed-batch culture of recombinant Escherichia coli.	Zymomonas mobilis levansucrase was overproduced by the fed-batch culture of recombinant Escherichia coli harboring a novel expression system that is constitutively expressed by the promoter from the Rahnella aquatilis levansucrase gene. Most of the levansucrase was produced as inclusion bodies in the bacterial cytoplasm, accounting for approximately 200f the total cellular protein. Refolding after complete denaturation by high concentrations of urea or guanidine hydrochloride was not successful, resulting in large amounts of insoluble aggregates. During the development of the refolding method, it was found that direct solubilization of the inclusion bodies with Triton X-100 reactivated the enzyme, with a considerable refolding efficiency.

9790892	The expression, refolding, and purification of the catalytic domain of human collagenase-3 (MMP-13).	We have cloned, expressed, and purified a recombinant C-terminal truncated form (residues Glu103-Asn274) of human collagenase-3 (MMP-13) in Escherichia coli. The molecule contains the catalytic domain of the enzyme and is expressed almost exclusively as inclusion bodies. Using a combination of rapid dilution and diafiltration, the enzyme has been successfully refolded from these inclusion bodies. The protein was purified to homogeneity using cation-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. The purified enzyme is a monomer with a Mr of approximately 19,600 and was characterized using a variety of techniques including, SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC, LC-MS, amino acid analysis, and dynamic light scattering. Microheterogeneity at the NH2-terminus of the refolded, purified protein disappeared after incubating for 30-60 min at 37 degreesC. The enzyme was highly active using a fluorescent peptide substrate and was found to release S-GAG from bovine nasal cartilage chips.	1998 Nov	Pathak N,Hu S I,Koehn J A	Protein expression and purification. 14(2) 283-8	Human Collagenase-3 (MMP-13)	MHPGVLAAFLFLSWTHCRALPLPSGGDEDDLSEEDLQFAERYLRSYYHPTNLAGILKENAASSMTERLREMQSFFGLEVTGKLDDNTLDVMKKPRCGVPDVGEYNVFPRTLKWSKMNLTYRIVNYTPDMTHSEVEKAFKKAFKVWSDVTPLNFTRLHDGIADIMISFGIKEHGDFYPFDGPSGLLAHAFPPGPNYGGDAHFDDDETWTSSSKGYNLFLVAAHEFGHSLGLDHSKDPGALMFPIYTYTGKSHFMLPDDDVQGIQSLYGPGDEDPNPKHPKTPDKCDPSLSLDAITSLRGETMIFKDRFFWRLHPQQVDAELFLTKSFWPELPNRIDAAYEHPSHDLIFIFRGRKFWALNGYDILEGYPKKISELGLPKEVKKISAAVHFEDTGKTLLFSGNQVWRYDDTNHIMDKDYPRLIEEDFPGIGDKVDAVYEKNGYIYFFNGPIQFEYSIWSNRIVRVMPANSILWC		P45452			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9179285	Purification and characterization of human and mouse recombinant alpha-fetoproteins expressed in Escherichia coli.	Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a tumor-associated embryonic molecule whose precise biological function(s) remains unclear. A more complete analysis of the physiological activities of this oncofetal protein has, until now, been severely limited by the lack of an appropriate source from which to obtain pure AFP in any sizeable quantity. In the present investigation, we obviate this problem by cloning and efficiently overexpressing mature mouse and human AFP cDNA&#39;s in Escherichia coli. For recombinant mouse AFP (rMoAFP), large segments of the coding region were excised from the preexisting plasmids pAFP1 and pAFP2, which together encompass 900f the AFP sequence. The mouse cDNA was made complete by the addition of N- and C-terminal encoding oligonucleotides. Mouse AFP cDNA was expressed directly as a full-length molecule in vector pTrp4 or as fusion proteins in plasmids pMALc and pRX1 under the transcriptional control of trp or tac promoters. Accumulation of rMoAFP was significantly increased in protease-deficient E. coli strains over nonprotease-deficient strains, &gt; or = 100f total cell protein. Of the gene fusion proteins examined, none offered significant advantage over the direct expression product in terms of recombinant protein stability, overall levels of synthesis, or facilitated purification. Recombinant AFP polypeptides expressed by pTrp4 were as expected, deposited in bacterial inclusion bodies. Subsequent to resolubilization/refolding, rMoAFP was first enriched by passage over Q-Sepharose resin followed by final purification using immobilized copper-chelate affinity chromatography. Protein sequencing of the N-terminus revealed that purified rMoAFP had a deletion of the first nine amino acids coded for by the full-length mouse AFP cDNA. Similar N-terminal deletions are observed with AFP isolates originating from natural sources. A complete human AFP cDNA was generated from a fetal liver cDNA library and was cloned into vector pTrp4. Recombinant human AFP (rHuAFP) was expressed under the identical conditions employed for rMoAFP but purification had to be modified to include preparative Mono Q anion exchange chromatography. N-terminal sequencing, amino acid compositional analysis, and electrospray mass spectrometry revealed that purified rHuAFP was intact and unaltered and that the initiator methionine was completely removed. The biological activity of recombinant AFP, as judged by its inhibitory effects on in vitro lymphocyte proliferation, was equivalent to that of the native protein. The availability of large quantities of mouse and human recombinant AFP molecules should now permit detailed structure-function analyses of this important oncofetal protein to proceed in a manner unimpeded by previous limitations in both quantity and quality of the native proteins.	1997 Jun	Boismenu R,Semeniuk D,Murgita R A	Protein expression and purification. 10(1) 10-26	Alpha-fetoprotein	MKWVESIFLIFLLNFTESRTLHRNEYGIASILDSYQCTAEISLADLATIFFAQFVQEATYKEVSKMVKDALTAIEKPTGDEQSSGCLENQLPAFLEELCHEKEILEKYGHSDCCSQSEEGRHNCFLAHKKPTPASIPLFQVPEPVTSCEAYEEDRETFMNKFIYEIARRHPFLYAPTILLWAARYDKIIPSCCKAENAVECFQTKAATVTKELRESSLLNQHACAVMKNFGTRTFQAITVTKLSQKFTKVNFTEIQKLVLDVAHVHEHCCRGDVLDCLQDGEKIMSYICSQQDTLSNKITECCKLTTLERGQCIIHAENDEKPEGLSPNLNRFLGDRDFNQFSSGEKNIFLASFVHEYSRRHPQLAVSVILRVAKGYQELLEKCFQTENPLECQDKGEEELQKYIQESQALAKRSCGLFQKLGEYYLQNAFLVAYTKKAPQLTSSELMAITRKMAATAATCCQLSEDKLLACGEGAADIIIGHLCIRHEMTPVNPGVGQCCTSSYANRRPCFSSLVVDETYVPPAFSDDKFIFHKDLCQAQGVALQTMKQEFLINLVKQKPQITEEQLEAVIADFSGLLEKCCQGQEQEVCFAEEGQKLISKTRAALGV		P02771			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11722180	Refolding and characterization of a yeast dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase overexpressed in Escherichia coli.	Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase (DDPPs) catalyzes the sequential condensation of isopentenyl diphosphate with farnesyl diphosphate to synthesize long-chain dehydrodolichyl diphosphate, which serves as a precursor of glycosyl carrier in glycoprotein biosynthesis in eukaryotes. To perform kinetic and structural studies of DDPPs, we have expressed yeast DDPPs using Escherichia coli as the host cell. Thioredoxin and His tag were utilized to increase the solubility of the recombinant protein and facilitate its purification using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) column. The protein was overexpressed in E. coli but mostly existed in pellet in the absence of detergent. The low quantity of soluble DDPPs was purified using Ni-NTA, Mono Q anion-exchange, and size-column chromatographies. The protein in the pellet was solubilized with 7 M urea and purified using Ni-NTA under denaturing condition. The protein refolding was achieved via the stepwise dialysis to remove the denaturant in the presence of 6 mM beta-mercaptoethanol. Detergent n-octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside and Triton X-100 increased the solubility of the DDPPs so that refolding can be performed at higher protein concentration. Alternatively, on-column refolding was carried out in a single step to obtain the active protein in large quantities. beta-Mercaptoethanol and Triton were both required in this quick refolding process. The kinetic studies indicated that the soluble and refolded DDPPs have comparable activities (k(cat) = 2 x 10(-4) s(-1)). Unlike its bacterial homologue, undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase, yeast DDPPs activity was not enhanced by Triton.	2001 Dec	Chang S Y,Tsai P C,Tseng C S,Liang P H	Protein expression and purification. 23(3) 432-9	Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase	METDSGIPGHSFVLKWTKNIFSRTLRASNCVPRHVGFIMDGNRRFARKKEMDVKEGHEAGFVSMSRILELCYEAGVDTATVFAFSIENFKRSSREVESLMTLARERIRQITERGELACKYGVRIKIIGDLSLLDKSLLEDVRVAVETTKNNKRATLNICFPYTGREEILHAMKETIVQHKKGAAIDESTLESHLYTAGVPPLDLLIRTSGVSRLSDFLIWQASSKGVRIELLDCLWPEFGPIRMAWILLKFSFHKSFLNKEYRLEEGDYDEETNGDPIDLKEKKLN	N-terminal thioredoxin + hexahistidine tag	P35196			7.5	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1370005	Removal of a proteolytic activity associated with aggregates formed from expression of creatine kinase in Escherichia coli leads to improved recovery of active enzyme.	Expression of creatine kinase (CK) from a Torpedo californica electric organ cDNA in Escherichia coli results in an insoluble protein product with no detectable CK activity. Although this is a stable aggregate that can be isolated in an enriched form by centrifugation, initial attempts to generate enzyme activity by denaturing and refolding yielded only minute amounts of active protein. We find that these low recoveries are due to proteolysis of the CK during denaturation and refolding. While this proteolytic activity is not inhibited by either phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) or EDTA, it can be largely removed from the CK aggregate by extraction with a detergent-containing buffer prior to denaturation. This treatment improves the recovery of active CK approximately 100-fold. We have also found similar proteolytic activity associated with the aggregate formed when a mutant of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) is expressed in E. coli. Discovery of this proteolytic activity in two different expression systems suggests that it should be considered as a potential problem for recovery of active protein from other inclusion bodies as well.	1990 Oct	Babbitt P C,West B L,Buechter D D,Kuntz I D,Kenyon G L	Bio/technology (Nature Publishing Company). 8(10) 945-9	Creatine kinase	MPFGNTHNKWKLNYSAAEEFPDLSKHNNHMAKALTLDIYKKLRDKETPSGFTLDDIIQTGVDNPGHPFIMTVGCVAGDEECYEVFKDLFDPVIEDRHGGYKPTDKHKTDLNQENLKGGDDLDPNYVLSSRVRTGRSIKGIALPPHCSRGERRLVEKLCIDGLATLTGEFQGKYYPLSSMSDAEQQQLIDDHFLFDKPISPLLLASGMARDWPDGRGIWHNNDKTFLVWVNEEDHLRVISMQKGGNMKEVFRRFCVGLKKIEDIFVKAGRGFMWNEHLGYVLTCPSNLGTGLRGGVHVKIPHLCKHEKFSEVLKRTRLQKRGTGGVDTAAVGSIYDISNADRLGFSEVEQVQMVVDGVKLMVEMEKRLENGKSIDDLMPAQK		P04414			8.5	37	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8167469	Refolding and characterization of human recombinant heparin-binding neurite-promoting factor.	Heparin-binding neurite-promoting factor (HBNF) is a highly basic, cysteine-rich 136-residue protein, and a member of a new class of heparin-binding proteins. It exhibits a neurite-outgrowth promoting activity and its expression is both temporally and spacially regulated during fetal and postnatal development. A high interspecies sequence conservation suggests important, presently unknown, biological functions. HBNF is structurally and most likely functionally related to the product of a developmentally regulated gene, MK (midkine). To elucidate biological roles of these proteins, recombinant forms of the proteins were produced. Expression of human recombinant HBNF and MK in Escherichia coli lead to the formation of insoluble aggregated protein that accounted for about 250f the total cellular protein. Homogeneous, monomeric forms of each protein were recovered from inclusion bodies by reduction with dithiothreitol and solubilization in 8 M urea. Refolding of the reduced and denatured protein occurred upon dialysis at pH 7.4. Human recombinant (hr) HBNF and hrMK prepared in this manner were further purified by heparin affinity chromatography. Chromatographic evidence demonstrates that refolding and concomitant disulfide bond formation in hrHBNF proceeds in high yield with minimal formation of stable nonnative disulfides. Studies on the redox status of the 10 cysteine residues of bovine brain HBNF and the refolded recombinant protein indicate that all cysteines are engaged in disulfide bond formation. The disulfide arrangements for the recombinant protein were found to be identical to those in the native protein isolated from bovine brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1994 Feb	Seddon A P,Hulmes J D,Decker M M,Kovesdi I,Fairhurst J L,Backer J,Dougher-Vermazen M,Böhlen P	Protein expression and purification. 5(1) 14-21	Heparin-binding neurite-promoting factor	MQAQQYQQQRRKFAAAFLAFIFILAAVDTAEAGKKEKPEKKVKKSDCGEWQWSVCVPTSGDCGLGTREGTRTGAECKQTMKTQRCKIPCNWKKQFGAECKYQFQAWGECDLNTALKTRTGSLKRALHNAECQKTVTISKPCGKLTKPKPQAESKKKKKEGKKQEKMLD		P21246			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8954576	High level expression of Ricinus communis casbene synthase in Escherichia coli and characterization of the recombinant enzyme.	Casbene synthase catalyzes the cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate (2) to casbene (1), a diterpene phytoalexin with antibacterial and antifungal activity that is produced by seedlings of castor bean (Ricinus communis L.) in response to fungal attack. We report the high-level expression of casbene synthase cDNA in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies, the solubilization and refolding of active casbene synthase, and the kinetic and product analysis of the recombinant enzyme. To overcome problems apparently associated with the presence in the casbene synthase gene of rare Arg codons, as well as the intrinsic antibacterial activity of casbene itself, the casbene synthase gene was expressed in an E. coli host harboring the pSM102 vector that encodes the dnaY gene for tArg(AGA/G), using an expression vector, pET-21d(+), carrying the tightly controlled T7lac promoter.	1996 Dec	Hill A M,Cane D E,Mau C J,West C A	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 336(2) 283-9	Casbene synthase	MALPSAAMQSNPEKLNLFHRLSSLPTTSLEYGNNRFPFFSSSAKSHFKKPTQACLSSTTHQEVRPLAYFPPTVWGNRFASLTFNPSEFESYDERVIVLKKKVKDILISSTSDSVETVILIDLLCRLGVSYHFENDIEELLSKIFNSQPDLVDEKECDLYTAAIVFRVFRQHGFKMSSDVFSKFKDSDGKFKESLRGDAKGMLSLFEASHLSVHGEDILEEAFAFTKDYLQSSAVELFPNLKRHITNALEQPFHSGVPRLEARKFIDLYEADIECRNETLLEFAKLDYNRVQLLHQQELCQFSKWWKDLNLASDIPYARDRMAEIFFWAVAMYFEPDYAHTRMIIAKVVLLISLIDDTIDAYATMEETHILAEAVARWDMSCLEKLPDYMKVIYKLLLNTFSEFEKELTAEGKSYSVKYGREAFQELVRGYYLEAVWRDEGKIPSFDDYLYNGSMTTGLPLVSTASFMGVQEITGLNEFQWLETNPKLSYASGAFIRLVNDLTSHVTEQQRGHVASCIDCYMNQHGVSKDEAVKILQKMATDCWKEINEECMRQSQVSVGHLMRIVNLARLTDVSYKYGDGYTDSQQLKQFVKGLFVDPISI		P59287			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10497081	Expression, single-step purification, and matrix-assisted refolding of a maize cytokinin glucoside-specific beta-glucosidase.	Availability of highly purified native beta-glucosidase Zm-p60.1 in milligram quantities was a basic requirement for analysis of structure-function relationships of the protein. Therefore, Zm-p60.1 was overexpressed to high levels as a fusion protein with a hexahistidine tag, (His)(6)Zm-p60.r, in Escherichia coli, resulting, however, in accumulation of most of the protein in insoluble inclusion bodies. Native (His)(6)Zm-p60.r was then purified either from the bacterial lysate soluble fraction or from inclusion bodies. In the first case, a single-step purification under native conditions based on immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) was developed. In the second case, a single-step purification protocol under denaturing conditions followed by IMAC-based matrix-assisted refolding was elaborated. The efficiency of the native protein purification from soluble fraction of bacterial homogenate was compared to the feasibility of purification and renaturation of the protein from inclusion bodies. Gain of authentic biological activity and quaternary structure after the refolding process was confirmed by K(m) determination and electrophoretic mobility under native conditions. The yield of properly refolded protein was assessed based on the specific activity of the refolded product.	1999 Oct	Zouhar J,Nanak E,Brzobohatý B	Protein expression and purification. 17(1) 153-62	Beta-glucosidase	MAPLLAAAMNHAAAHPGLRSHLVGPNNESFSRHHLPSSSPQSSKRRCNLSFTTRSARVGSQNGVQMLSPSEIPQRDWFPSDFTFGAATSAYQIEGAWNEDGKGESNWDHFCHNHPERILDGSNSDIGANSYHMYKTDVRLLKEMGMDAYRFSISWPRILPKGTKEGGINPDGIKYYRNLINLLLENGIEPYVTIFHWDVPQALEEKYGGFLDKSHKSIVEDYTYFAKVCFDNFGDKVKNWLTFNEPQTFTSFSYGTGVFAPGRCSPGLDCAYPTGNSLVEPYTAGHNILLAHAEAVDLYNKHYKRDDTRIGLAFDVMGRVPYGTSFLDKQAEERSWDINLGWFLEPVVRGDYPFSMRSLARERLPFFKDEQKEKLAGSYNMLGLNYYTSRFSKNIDISPNYSPVLNTDDAYASQEVNGPDGKPIGPPMGNPWIYMYPEGLKDLLMIMKNKYGNPPIYITENGIGDVDTKETPLPMEAALNDYKRLDYIQRHIATLKESIDLGSNVQGYFAWSLLDNFEWFAGFTERYGIVYVDRNNNCTRYMKESAKWLKEFNTAKKPSKKILTPA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P49235			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11106418	Refolding, structural transition and spermatozoa-binding of recombinant bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata) zona pellucida glycoprotein-C expressed in Escherichia coli.	An internal cDNA fragment (978 bp) corresponding to bonnet monkey (Macaca radiata) zona pellucida glycoprotein-C (bmZPC), excluding the N-terminal signal sequence and the C-terminal transmembrane-like domain, was cloned in pQE-30 vector and the protein expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Recombinant bmZPC (r-bmZPC) was solubilized from purified inclusion bodies in the absence of a high concentration of chaotropic agents and was subsequently refolded. Use of a low concentration of urea (2 M) during solubilization of r-bmZPC helped to minimize the extent of protein aggregation during refolding of the recombinant protein, and retain the existing native-like secondary structure that was essential for proper folding. Purified r-bmZPC appeared as a dominant band of 43 kDa on SDS/PAGE and Western blot. Although it lacked carbohydrate moieties, the purified and refolded r-bmZPC bound to the head region of bonnet monkey spermatozoa, confirming the existence of a native-like conformation. CD revealed a maximum at 200 nm and a single broad minimum extending from 209 to 216 nm, indicating the presence of both alpha-helical and beta-sheet conformations in the refolded r-bmZPC. Two different phases of transition were observed by urea-gradient electrophoresis, suggesting the existence of multiple intermediate stages during the unfolding of r-bmZPC. The availability of refolded r-bmZPC will help in elucidating its role during the complex cascade of events during fertilization.	2000 Dec	Patra A K,Gahlay G K,Reddy B V,Gupta S K,Panda A K	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 267(24) 7075-81	Zona pellucida glycoprotein-C	MRLLQCVLLCVSLSLVLSGQHKPETPGYSSVLHCGLWSFQFAVNLSQEATSPPVLITWDNQGLLHKLQNDSDCGTWIRKRPGSSVVLEATYSSCYVTEWDSHYIMPVGVEGVGVAEHKMVPERKLLKCPMDLLARDAPDTDWCDSIPARDRLPCAPSPISRGDCEGLGCCYSSENSCYYGNTVTLRCTREGHFSIAVSRNVVSPPLLLDSVRLALRNDSACNPVMATQAFVLFHFPFTSCGTTRRITGDRAVYENELVATRDVKNGSRGSVTRDSIFRLHVSCSYSVSSNSLPIKVQVFTLPPPFPETQPGPLTLELQIAKDKNYGSYYGVGDYPVVKLLRDPIYVEVSILHRTDPSLGLLLHQCWATPSTDPLSQPQWPILVKGCPYIGDNYQTQLIPVQKALDLPFPSHYQRFSIFTFSFVDPTVEKQALRGPVHLHCSVSVCQPAETPSSVRTCPDLSRRRKFSTIFQNTTASVSSKGPMILLQATKDPPEKLRAPVDSKVLWVAGLSGTLILGGLVVSYLAIKQLNCPDQTCQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O19027			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11437598	Overexpression and refolding of the hydrophobic ribosomal P0 protein from Trypanosoma cruzi: a component of the P1/P2/P0 complex.	The P0 protein is part of the ribosomal eukaryotic stalk, which is an elongated lateral protuberance of the large ribosomal subunit involved in the translocation step of protein synthesis. P0 is the minimal portion of the stalk that is able to support accurate protein synthesis. The P0 C-terminal peptide is highly antigenic and a major target of the antibody response in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and patients suffering chronic heart disease produced by the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite. The T. cruzi P0 (TcP0) protein was cloned into the pRSET A vector and expressed in Escherichia coli fused to a His-tag. The identity of the protein was confirmed by immunoblotting. Due to the formation of inclusion bodies the protein was purified using the following steps: (i) differential centrifugation to separate the inclusion bodies from soluble proteins and (ii) affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. TcP0 showed high tendency to aggregation during refolding assays. However, TcP0 could be efficiently folded in the presence of a low concentration of SDS. The folding of the protein was confirmed using urea gradient electrophoresis, limited proteolysis, circular dichroism, and tryptophan fluorescence. Native electrophoresis showed that the folded TcP0 (and not a folding intermediate) was the cause of aggregation in the absence of SDS. The protocol described here permitted us to obtain large amounts (up to 30 mg per culture liter) of pure and folded TcP0, a very hydrophobic protein with a high tendency to aggregation.	2001 Jul	Juri Ayub M,Levin M J,Aguilar C F	Protein expression and purification. 22(2) 225-33	Ribosomal protein P0	MPSVSEAKREYEERFNGCLTKYGRVLFCLMDNVRSQQVHDVRRDLRGLGELVMGKKTLQKKIVERRAEDKKASAYDKLLYNTCIEKKLLCGNTALIFTNEEIPVITAVLDKHRVQAPARVGAIAPCDVIVPAGNTGMEPKATSFFQALNIATKIAKGTVEIVSDKKVLSVGDRVDNSTATLLQKLDISPFYYQVEVQSVWDRGMLFLREDLSITDDVVEKYLLEGISNVAALSLGAGIPTAATLPHMIMDAFKTLLGASVATEYEFDEFDGKNLRKAALEGNLGGGVADAAAAADTGAAAAPAAAAEPEEEDDDDDFGMGALF		P26796			8.8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8425104	Refolding of recombinant Pneumocystis carinii dihydrofolate reductase and characterization of the enzyme.	The isolation of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA sequences from the messenger RNA of Pneumocystis carinii using the polymerase chain reaction is described. The 206-amino acid P. carinii DHFR was expressed to high levels in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies using the T7 promoter expression system. Solubilization of the inclusion bodies in 4 M guanidine hydrochloride and refolding of the recombinant protein in the presence of 0.5d0c850olyethylene glycol 1450 yielded correctly folded DHFR which was purified to homogeneity by methotrexate-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The refolded enzyme was readily crystallized as a ternary complex with NADPH and various inhibitors. The enzyme exhibited a sharp pH optimum with maximum activity at pH 7.0 (turnover number = 6500 min-1). Km values for dihydrofolate (DHF) and NADPH were 2.3 and 3.0 microM, respectively, in 0.1 m imidazole buffer, pH 7. Folate did not act as a substrate. Comparison of the kinetic properties of the refolded enzyme with soluble P. carinii DHFR expressed at low levels in the T7 expression system showed similar pH-activity profiles, Km values for DHF and NADPH, and IC50 values for several known antifolates which were tested as inhibitors of the enzyme.	1993 Feb	Delves C J,Ballantine S P,Tansik R L,Baccanari D P,Stammers D K	Protein expression and purification. 4(1) 16-23	Dihydrofolate Reductase	MNQQKSLTLIVALTTSYGIGRSNSLPWKLKKEISYFKRVTSFVPTFDSFESMNVVLMGRKTWESIPLQFRPLKGRINVVITRNESLDLGNGIHSAKSLDHALELLYRTYGSESSVQINRIFVIGGAQLYKAAMDHPKLDRIMATIIYKDIHCDVFFPLKFRDKEWSSVWKKEKHSDLESWVGTKVPHGKINEDGFDYEFEMWTRDL		P16184			7	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2158928	High-level synthesis of recombinant HIV-1 protease and the recovery of active enzyme from inclusion bodies.	A complete chemical synthesis and assembly of genes for the production of human immunodeficiency virus type-I protease (HIV-PR) and its precursors are described. The T7 expression system was used to produce high levels of active HIV-PR and its precursors in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. The gene encoding the open reading frames of HIV-PR was expressed in E. coli as a 10-kDa protein, while the genes encoding HIV-PR precursors were expressed as larger proteins, which were partially processed in E. coli to the 10-kDa form. These processing events are autoproteolytic, since a single-base mutation, changing the active-site aspartic acid to glycine, completely abolished the conversion. HIV-PR can be released with 8 M urea from washed cellular inclusion bodies, resulting in a preparation with few bacterial host proteins. After refolding, this preparation contains no nonspecific protease or peptidase activities.

8472852	High expression of the hormone binding active extracellular domain (1-294) of rat lutropin receptor in Escherichia coli.	Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, the cDNA fragment corresponding to the receptor coding region for residues 1-294 was prepared from rat lutropin receptor (LHR) cDNA and subsequently subcloned into Escherichia coli expression vector pT7-7. This truncated receptor was efficiently expressed in E. coli as indicated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver staining. The recombinant protein present in the inclusion bodies was solubilized in 6 M guanidine-HCl and purified in two successive steps of fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) using Superose-12 and Mono Q columns. Refolding of the purified recombinant protein was achieved in 1.5 M guanidine-HCl in the presence of an equimolar proportion of cysteine and cystine. The refolded soluble truncated LHR(1-294) had apparent molecular weights of 33 kDa and 140 kDa under reducing and nonreducing conditions, respectively. The multimeric nature of the extracellular domain of the receptor is believed to be due to its self-association by intermolecular disulfide bond formation since the 1-294 amino acid segment has nine cysteine residues and thus has one or possibly more free sulfhydryl groups. The purified truncated receptor had high binding affinity for human choriogonadotropin (hCG) as indicated by ligand blotting on SDS-PAGE and radioligand receptor assays. The amount of hCG required for 50 0nhibition of binding of 125I-hCG to the soluble truncated receptor was 2.7 x 10(-10) M (or 12.25 ng). Similarly, the amount of soluble truncated receptor required for 50 0nhibition of 125I-hCG binding to the rat ovarian receptor in the radioligand receptor assay was 58 ng.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1993 Feb	Chen W,Bahl O P	Molecular and cellular endocrinology. 91(1-2) 35-41	Lutropin Receptor	MGRRVPALRQLLVLAVLLLKPSQLQSRELSGSRCPEPCDCAPDGALRCPGPRAGLARLSLTYLPVKVIPSQAFRGLNEVVKIEISQSDSLERIEANAFDNLLNLSELLIQNTKNLLYIEPGAFTNLPRLKYLSICNTGIRTLPDVTKISSSEFNFILEICDNLHITTIPGNAFQGMNNESVTLKLYGNGFEEVQSHAFNGTTLISLELKENIYLEKMHSGAFQGATGPSILDISSTKLQALPSHGLESIQTLIALSSYSLKTLPSKEKFTSLLVATLTYPSHCCAFRNLPKKEQNFSFSIFENFSKQCESTVRKADNETLYSAIFEENELSGWDYDYGFCSPKTLQCAPEPDAFNPCEDIMGYAFLRVLIWLINILAIFGNLTVLFVLLTSRYKLTVPRFLMCNLSFADFCMGLYLLLIASVDSQTKGQYYNHAIDWQTGSGCGAAGFFTVFASELSVYTLTVITLERWHTITYAVQLDQKLRLRHAIPIMLGGWLFSTLIATMPLVGISNYMKVSICLPMDVESTLSQVYILSILILNVVAFVVICACYIRIYFAVQNPELTAPNKDTKIAKKMAILIFTDFTCMAPISFFAISAAFKVPLITVTNSKILLVLFYPVNSCANPFLYAIFTKAFQRDFLLLLSRFGCCKRRAELYRRKEFSAYTSNCKNGFPGASKPSQATLKLSTVHCQQPIPPRALTH		P16235			7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12592025	Purification of correctly oxidized MHC class I heavy-chain molecules under denaturing conditions: a novel strategy exploiting disulfide assisted protein folding.	The aim of this study has been to develop a strategy for purifying correctly oxidized denatured major histocompability complex class I (MHC-I) heavy-chain molecules, which on dilution, fold efficiently and become functional. Expression of heavy-chain molecules in bacteria results in the formation of insoluble cellular inclusion bodies, which must be solubilized under denaturing conditions. Their subsequent purification and refolding is complicated by the fact that (1). correct folding can only take place in combined presence of beta(2)-microglobulin and a binding peptide; and (2). optimal in vitro conditions for disulfide bond formation ( approximately pH 8) and peptide binding ( approximately pH 6.6) are far from complementary. Here we present a two-step strategy, which relies on uncoupling the events of disulfide bond formation and peptide binding. In the first phase, heavy-chain molecules with correct disulfide bonding are formed under non-reducing denaturing conditions and separated from scrambled disulfide bond forms by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. In the second step, rapid refolding of the oxidized heavy chains is afforded by disulfide bond-assisted folding in the presence of beta(2)-microglobulin and a specific peptide. Under conditions optimized for peptide binding, refolding and simultaneous peptide binding of the correctly oxidized heavy chain was much more efficient than that of the fully reduced molecule.	2003 Mar	Ferré Henrik,Ruffet Emmanuel,Blicher Thomas,Sylvester-Hvid Christina,Nielsen Lise Lotte B,Hobley Timothy J,Thomas Owen R T,Buus Søren	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 12(3) 551-9	Major histocompatibility complex class I	MEPSLLSLFVLGVVALTETRAGSHSLRYFDTAMSRPELGDSQFISVGYVDDQQFVRFDSSSESPRMEPRAAWMDKVDQEDPNYWEGQTQISRSNAQITRVGLETIRGYYNQSRGGLHTYQTMIGCEVHPDGSFRKGFWQHAYDGHDYIALDRETLTWTAADPGAENTKRKWEAERSIAERYKAYLEEECVQWLKKYLQMGKDVLLRTEPSSARVSRHSGPDGEVSLRCRAQGFYPAEISLTWLRDGEEQLQDTEFIETRPGGDGTFQKWAAVAMAPGQEDRYSCRVQHEALAQPLSLRWEPEASSLWVIVGVTAGVLVLVTAVVAGAVILRRRNSGGKGGAYVPGAA		Q9TPK7			6.6	18	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11049754	Recombinant expression of the Candida rugosa lip4 lipase in Escherichia coli.	It is difficult to express recombinant Candida rugosa lipases (CRLs) in heterologous systems, since C. rugosa utilizes a nonuniversal serine codon CUG for leucine. In this study, recombinant LIP4 in which all 19 CUG codons had been converted to a universal serine codon was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant LIP4 was found mainly in the inclusion bodies and showed a low catalytic activity. To increase the amount of soluble form and activity of recombinant LIP4, the DNA was fused to the gene for thioredoxin (TrxFus-LIP4) and then expressed in E. coli strain AD494(DE3). This strategy promotes the formation of disulfide bonds in the cytosol and yields enzymatically active forms of LIP4. The purified recombinant TrxFus-LIP4 and LIP4 expressed in AD494(DE3) had the same catalytic profiles. In addition, recombinant LIP4 had higher esterase activities toward long-chain ester and lower lipase activities toward tributyrin, triolein, and olive oil. This system for the expression of fungal lipase in E. coli strain AD494(DE3) is reliable and may produce enzymatically active forms of recombinant lipase without an in vitro refolding procedure.	2000 Nov	Tang S J,Sun K H,Sun G H,Chang T Y,Lee G C	Protein expression and purification. 20(2) 308-13	Lipase	MKLALVLSLIVSVAAAPTATLANGDTITGLNAIINEAFLGIPFAQPPVGNLRFKPPVPYSASLNGQKFTSYGPSCMQMNPLGNWDSSLPKAAINSLMQSKLFQAVLPNGEDCLTINVVRPSGTKPGANLPVMVWIFGGGFEVGGSSLFPPAQMITASVLMGKPIIHVSMNYRVASWGFLAGPDIKAEGSGNAGLHDQRLGLQWVADNIAGFGGDPSKVTIFGESAGSMSVMCQLLWNDGDNTYNGKPLFRAAIMQSGAMVPSDPVDGPYGTQIYDQVVASAGCGSASDKLACLRSISNDKLFQATSDTPGALAYPSLRLSFLPRPDGTFITDDMFKLVRDGKCANVPVIIGDQNDEGTVFALSSLNVTTDAQARQYFKESFIHASDAEIDTLMAAYPSDITQGSPFDTGIFNAITPQFKRIAAVLGDLAFTLPRRYFLNHFQGGTKYSFLSKQLSGLPVIGTHHANDIVWQDFLVSHSSAVYNNAFIAFANDLDPNKAGLLVNWPKYTSSSQSGNNLLQINALGLYTGKDNFRTAGYDALFTNPSSFFV		P32948			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12963350	Expression, purification, and characterization of human enteropeptidase catalytic subunit in Escherichia coli.	Enteropeptidase (synonym:enterokinase, EC 3.4.21.9) is a heterodimeric serine protease of the intestinal brush border that activates trypsinogen by highly specific cleavage of the trypsinogen activation peptide following the sequence (Asp)(4)-Lys. The DNA sequence encoding the light chain (catalytic subunit) of human enteropeptidase (GenBank Accession No. U09860) was synthesized from 26 oligonucleotides by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into plasmid pET-32a downstream to the gene of fusion partner thioredoxin immediately after the DNA sequence encoding enteropeptidase recognition site. The fusion protein thioredoxin/human enteropeptidase light chain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain in both soluble and insoluble forms. The soluble recombinant fusion protein failed to undergo autocatalytic cleavage and activation; however, autocatalytic cleavage and activation of recombinant human enteropeptidase light chain (L-HEP) were achieved by solubilization and renaturation of the fusion protein from inclusion bodies and the active L-HEP was purified on agarose-linked soybean trypsin inhibitor. The purified L-HEP cleaved the synthetic peptide substrate Gly-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys-beta-naphthylamide with kinetic parameters K(m)=0.16 mM and k(cat)=115 s(-1) and small ester Z-Lys-SBzl with K(m)=140 microM, k(cat)=133 s(-1). L-HEP associated with soybean trypsin inhibitor slowly and small ester Z-Lys-SBzl cleavage was inhibited with K(i)(*)=2.3 nM. L-HEP digested thioredoxin/human epidermal growth factor fusion protein five times faster than equal activity units of bovine recombinant light chain (EKMax, Invitrogen) at the same conditions.	2003 Sep	Gasparian Marine E,Ostapchenko Valeriy G,Schulga Alexey A,Dolgikh Dmitry A,Kirpichnikov Mikhail P	Protein expression and purification. 31(1) 133-9	Enteropeptidase	MGSKRGISSRHHSLSSYEIMFAALFAILVVLCAGLIAVSCLTIKESQRGAALGQSHEARATFKITSGVTYNPNLQDKLSVDFKVLAFDLQQMIDEIFLSSNLKNEYKNSRVLQFENGSIIVVFDLFFAQWVSDQNVKEELIQGLEANKSSQLVTFHIDLNSVDILDKLTTTSHLATPGNVSIECLPGSSPCTDALTCIKADLFCDGEVNCPDGSDEDNKMCATVCDGRFLLTGSSGSFQATHYPKPSETSVVCQWIIRVNQGLSIKLSFDDFNTYYTDILDIYEGVGSSKILRASIWETNPGTIRIFSNQVTATFLIESDESDYVGFNATYTAFNSSELNNYEKINCNFEDGFCFWVQDLNDDNEWERIQGSTFSPFTGPNFDHTFGNASGFYISTPTGPGGRQERVGLLSLPLDPTLEPACLSFWYHMYGENVHKLSINISNDQNMEKTVFQKEGNYGDNWNYGQVTLNETVKFKVAFNAFKNKILSDIALDDISLTYGICNGSLYPEPTLVPTPPPELPTDCGGPFELWEPNTTFSSTNFPNSYPNLAFCVWILNAQKGKNIQLHFQEFDLENINDVVEIRDGEEADSLLLAVYTGPGPVKDVFSTTNRMTVLLITNDVLARGGFKANFTTGYHLGIPEPCKADHFQCKNGECVPLVNLCDGHLHCEDGSDEADCVRFFNGTTNNNGLVRFRIQSIWHTACAENWTTQISNDVCQLLGLGSGNSSKPIFSTDGGPFVKLNTAPDGHLILTPSQQCLQDSLIRLQCNHKSCGKKLAAQDITPKIVGGSNAKEGAWPWVVGLYYGGRLLCGASLVSSDWLVSAAHCVYGRNLEPSKWTAILGLHMKSNLTSPQTVPRLIDEIVINPHYNRRRKDNDIAMMHLEFKVNYTDYIQPICLPEENQVFPPGRNCSIAGWGTVVYQGTTANILQEADVPLLSNERCQQQMPEYNITENMICAGYEEGGIDSCQGDSGGPLMCQENNRWFLAGVTSFGYKCALPNRPGVYARVSRFTEWIQSFLH	Thioredoxin	P98073			8.6	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9545584	Successful recovery of the normal electrophysiological properties of PorB (class 3) porin from Neisseria meningitidis after expression in Escherichia coli and renaturation.	Neisseria meningitidis PorB class 3 porins obtained either from native membranes (wild-type) or recovered from inclusion bodies following expression in Escherichia coli (recombinant), have been reconstituted into solvent-free planar phospholipid membranes. The wild-type and recombinant porins exhibited the same single-trimer conductance (1-1.3 nS in 200 mM NaCl), tri-level closure pattern, characteristic of functional channel trimers, and pattern of insertion into planar membranes. Both proteins were open at low voltages and displayed two voltage-dependent closure processes, one at positive and the other at negative potentials. Both showed asymmetric voltage dependence such that one gating process occurred at lower voltages (Vo=15 mV) than the other (Vo=25 mV). The sign of the potential that resulted in closure at low voltages varied from membrane to membrane indicating that they may have the property of auto-directed insertion (in analogy to the mitochondrial channel, VDAC). In the case of the recombinant porin, the steepness of the voltage dependence of one gating process was slightly less (n=1.3) than that observed for the other process or for the wild-type channel (n=1.5-1.7). Both channels have a high (40%) probability of closure even at 0 mV. While both channels show a slight selectivity for Cl- over Na+, the selectivity of the recombinant porin is a bit higher (permeability ratio of 2.8 vs. 1.6) as measured using a 2-fold salt gradient. Thus, the method employed to refold the recombinant porin was successful in not only restoring wild-type structure [H.L. Qi, J.Y. Tai, M.S.

10049671	Refolding, purification, and characterization of a loop deletion mutant of human Bcl-2 from bacterial inclusion bodies.	This report describes the cloning of recombinant human Bcl-2, in which the putative disordered loop region has been replaced with a flexible linker and the hydrophobic C-terminus has been replaced with a 6xHis tag (Bcl-2(6-32)-AAAA-Bcl-2(86-206)-HHHHHH, abbreviation rhBcl-2; amino acid numbering excludes the initiating methionine). This protein was expressed in Escherichia coli where it accumulated in insoluble form in inclusion bodies. After lysis the washed inclusion bodies were solubilized and an l-arginine assisted protein refolding route was employed to obtain biologically active protein. rhBcl-2 was purified further by nickel chelate chromatography to give protein of &gt;95d0c850urity, with an overall yield of 5 mg per g of E. coli cell paste. Edman sequencing showed that approximately 900f the rhBcl-2 retained the initiating methionine residue. Analytical size exclusion chromatography suggested that the refolded and purified rhBcl-2 was monomeric in nondenaturing solution. Purified protein had an affinity for a Bax BH3 domain peptide comparable to that for in vivo folded recombinant human Bcl-2 and suppressed caspase activation in a cell-free assay for apoptosis. 1H NMR spectroscopy of rhBcl-2, both free and complexed with the Bax BH3 domain peptide, provided further evidence for the structural and functional integrity of the refolded protein. These findings parallel and extend those of Muchmore et al., who found that a loop deletion mutant of human Bcl-XL retained anti-apoptotic function.	1999 Mar	Anderson M,Blowers D,Hewitt N,Hedge P,Breeze A,Hampton I,Taylor I	Protein expression and purification. 15(2) 162-70	Bcl-2	MAHAGRTGYDNREIVMKYIHYKLSQRGYEWDAGDVGAAPPGAAPAPGIFSSQPGHTPHPAASRDPVARTSPLQTPAAPGAAAGPALSPVPPVVHLTLRQAGDDFSRRYRRDFAEMSSQLHLTPFTARGRFATVVEELFRDGVNWGRIVAFFEFGGVMCVESVNREMSPLVDNIALWMTEYLNRHLHTWIQDNGGWDAFVELYGPSMRPLFDFSWLSLKTLLSLALVGACITLGAYLGHK	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P10415			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10425160	A-protein from achromogenic atypical Aeromonas salmonicida: molecular cloning, expression, purification, and characterization.	Achromogenic atypical Aeromonas salmonicida is the causative agent of goldfish ulcer disease. Virulence of this bacterium is associated with the production of a paracrystalline outer membrane A-layer protein. The species-specific structural gene for the monomeric form of A-protein was cloned into a pET-3d plasmid in order to express and produce a recombinant form of the protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The induced protein was isolated from inclusion bodies by a simple solubilization-renaturation procedure and purified by ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose to over 95d0c850ure monomeric protein. Recombinant A-protein was compared by biochemical, immunological, and molecular methods with the A-protein isolated from atypical A. salmonicida bacterial cells by the glycine and the membrane extraction methods. The recombinant form was found to be undistinguishable from the wild type when examined by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography. The immunological similarity of the protein samples was demonstrated by employing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies in ELISA and Western blot techniques. All forms of A-protein were found to activate the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha from murine macrophage. To date, this represents the first large-scale production of biologically active recombinant A-protein.	1999 Aug	Maurice S,Hädge D,Dekel M,Friedman A,Gertler A,Shoseyov O	Protein expression and purification. 16(3) 396-404	A-protein	MDVVISPNDNTFVTTSLASVTKQPVLDFSTAQQNLTLNFSEVGDLKNNGFIVLEIQGEGQFNDAEIRQWLSNGFWRRPFTGLLVNPNDHGNFANSGEVNDVRKFFKIISDGTQLTIVHTIDSNGKRLRLALASDVEETINFADAEVELKLNLANQAFKLTSGSQGTVALTAGALWNASYTADPVATKPLFKLGKLFQLSLTNAGKATALVSEGFLKLNIGDANISATDFAITNVTTNQTIQRDKVNLTLTGDVSAFKKDANGNLVNKAGASIGWKAAADGQSATAVLGAGNMAGGVQNALAAFGTLYVAADNTVPVPAVNFNVKAEIQGDSQATYNYFKDELADLFILTRDGMKFDTITTGTTSANLIHIRDVSNILPTEGGKIFVTITEYADHAANGRGEGTVLVTRKALSVTLPSGGAVTLKPADVAADVGASITAGRQARLVFEVETNQGEVAVKKSNAEGVDIQNGTRGTAPLVDFTLRLLTKPERKLSWLLPPLSNN		P35823			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10648170	Cloning, overexpression, and purification of Escherichia coli quinolinate synthetase.	Quinolinate synthetase catalyzes the second step of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of pyridine nucleotide formation. In particular, quinolinate synthetase is involved in the condensation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate and iminoaspartate to form quinolinic acid. To study the mechanism of action, the specificity of the enzyme and the interaction with l-aspartate oxidase, the other component of the so-called &quot;quinolinate synthetase complex,&quot; the cloning, the overexpression, and the purification to homogeneity of Escherichia coli quinolinate synthetase were undertaken. The results are presented in this paper. Since the overexpression of the enzyme resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies, a procedure of renaturation and refolding had to be set up. The overexpression and purification procedure reported in this paper allowed the isolation of 12 mg of electrophoretically homogeneous quinolinate synthetase from 1 liter of E. coli culture. A new, continuous, method for the evaluation of quinolinate synthetase activity was also devised and is presented. Finally, our data definitely exclude the possibility that other enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of quinolinic acid in E. coli, since it is possible to synthesize quinolinic acid from l-aspartate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and O(2) by using only nadA and nadB gene overexpressed products.	2000 Feb	Ceciliani F,Caramori T,Ronchi S,Tedeschi G,Mortarino M,Galizzi A	Protein expression and purification. 18(1) 64-70	Quinolinate synthetase	MSVMFDPDTAIYPFPPKPTPLSIDEKAYYREKIKRLLKERNAVMVAHYYTDPEIQQLAEETGGCISDSLEMARFGAKHPASTLLVAGVRFMGETAKILSPEKTILMPTLQAECSLDLGCPVEEFNAFCDAHPDRTVVVYANTSAAVKARADWVVTSSIAVELIDHLDSLGEKIIWAPDKHLGRYVQKQTGGDILCWQGACIVHDEFKTQALTRLQEEYPDAAILVHPESPQAIVDMADAVGSTSQLIAAAKTLPHQRLIVATDRGIFYKMQQAVPDKELLEAPTAGEGATCRSCAHCPWMAMNGLQAIAEALEQEGSNHEVHVDERLRERALVPLNRMLDFAATLRG		P11458			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9488701	Intramolecular processing of prothermolysin.	Thermolysin, an extracellular zinc endopeptidase from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, is synthesized as a pre-proenzyme and the prosequence has been shown to assist the refolding of the denatured enzyme in vitro and to inhibit enzyme activity (O&#39;Donohue, M. J., and Beaumont, A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 26477-26481). To determine whether prosequence cleavage from the mature enzyme is autocatalytic and if so, whether it is an intermolecular or intramolecular process, N-terminal histidine-tagged prothermolysin was expressed in Escherichia coli. Although partial processing to mature enzyme occurred, most of the proenzyme was recovered intact from inclusion bodies. This was then solubilized in guanidinium hydrochloride, immobilized on a cobalt-containing resin, and after dialysis against renaturation buffer, was quantitatively transformed to mature enzyme. However, when a mutation was introduced into the mature sequence to inactivate thermolysin, the proenzyme was not processed either in vivo or in vitro. In addition, mutated prothermolysin was not processed by exogenous thermolysin under a variety of experimental conditions. The results demonstrate that thermolysin maturation can proceed via an autocatalytic intramolecular pathway.	1998 Mar	Marie-Claire C,Roques B P,Beaumont A	The Journal of biological chemistry. 273(10) 5697-701	Prothermolysin	MKMKMKLASFGLAAGLAAQVFLPYNALASTEHVTWNQQFQTPQFISGDLLKVNGTSPEELVYQYVEKNENKFKFHENAKDTLQLKEKKNDNLGFTFMRFQQTYKGIPVFGAVVTSHVKDGTLTALSGTLIPNLDTKGSLKSGKKLSEKQARDIAEKDLVANVTKEVPEYEQGKDTEFVVYVNGDEASLAYVVNLNFLTPEPGNWLYIIDAVDGKILNKFNQLDAAKPGDVKSITGTSTVGVGRGVLGDQKNINTTYSTYYYLQDNTRGNGIFTYDAKYRTTLPGSLWADADNQFFASYDAPAVDAHYYAGVTYDYYKNVHNRLSYDGNNAAIRSSVHYSQGYNNAFWNGSQMVYGDGDGQTFIPLSGGIDVVAHELTHAVTDYTAGLIYQNESGAINEAISDIFGTLVEFYANKNPDWEIGEDVYTPGISGDSLRSMSDPAKYGDPDHYSKRYTGTQDNGGVHINSGIINKAAYLISQGGTHYGVSVVGIGRDKLGKIFYRALTQYLTPTSNFSQLRAAAVQSATDLYGSTSQEVASVKQAFDAVGVK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P00800			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9115985	Molecular, biological, and preliminary structural analysis of recombinant bryodin 1, a ribosome-inactivating protein from the plant Bryonia dioica.	Bryonia dioica (Cucurbitaceae family) produces at least two type I ribosome-inactivating proteins, bryodin 1 (BD1) and bryodin 2 (BD2). A cDNA sequence encoding BD1 was isolated from B. dioica leaf mRNA using degenerative oligonucleotides and codes for a 22 amino acid signal peptide followed by a protein of 267 residues. Expression of two recombinant BD1 (rBD1) forms in Escherichia coli yielded proteins of 267 (to the natural stop codon) and 247 amino acids (to the putative cleavage site yielding the mature protein) that had identical protein synthesis inhibition activity as compared to native BD1. The substitution of Lys for Glu at position 189 near the active site reduced the ability of rBD1 to inhibit protein synthesis by 10-fold. Toxicologic analysis showed that rBD1 was well tolerated in rodents with LD50 values of 40 mg/kg in mice and &gt;25 mg/kg in rats. A crystal of mature rBD1 protein was used to collect X-ray diffraction data to 2.1 A resolution. The rBD1 crystal structure was solved and showed extensive homology with other type I RIPs and A chains of type II RIPs. The studies described here demonstrate that rBD1 retains full biologic activity and serve as a guide for using this potent, yet nontoxic, RIP in the construction of single-chain immunotoxin fusion proteins.	1997 Mar	Gawlak S L,Neubauer M,Klei H E,Chang C Y,Einspahr H M,Siegall C B	Biochemistry. 36(11) 3095-103	Bryodin 1	MIKLLVLWLLILTIFLKSPTVEGDVSFRLSGATTTSYGVFIKNLREALPYERKVYNIPLLRSSISGSGRYTLLHLTNYADETISVAVDVTNVYIMGYLAGDVSYFFNEASATEAAKFVFKDAKKKVTLPYSGNYERLQTAAGKIRENIPLGLPALDSAITTLYYYTASSAASALLVLIQSTAESARYKFIEQQIGKRVDKTFLPSLATISLENNWSALSKQIQIASTNNGQFESPVVLIDGNNQRVSITNASARVVTSNIALLLNRNNIAAIGEDISMTLIGFEHGLYGI		P33185			7.4	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9304871	An alternative purification protocol for producing hepatitis B virus X antigen on a preparative scale in Escherichia coli.	A truncated variant of the hepatitis B virus X gene (HBx) was cloned into the fusion expression vector of pGEX-3X (Pharmacia), resulting in a GST-HBx fusion gene construction (pGEX-3XXBF). This plasmid was transformed into and expressed by the Escherichia coli strain DH5. More than 800f the expressed fusion protein was found in the insoluble fraction (inclusion body) of the cell lysate. The fusion protein was selectively extracted from the inclusion bodies with 8 M urea at pH 6.5, and it was refolded by diluting 3-fold with deionized distilled water at 4 degrees C. The in vitro cleavage of the refolded fusion protein by factor Xa at about 2-3 mg ml-1 in the presence of 2.66 M urea at pH 6.5 was complete. The final steps of purification involved precipitation of the cleaved proteins with ammonium sulphate, solubilization in guanidine hydrochloride and separation on a Superdex 75 FPLC column. With this approach, following an inclusion body strategy and a beneficial in vitro refolding, a predominantly hydrophobic and highly disulphide-bonded protein was produced in preparative scale for subsequent diagnostic use.	1997 Aug	Marczinovits I,Somogyi C,Patthy A,Németh P,Molnár J	Journal of biotechnology. 56(2) 81-8	Hepatitis B virus X antigen					None	6.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9720037	Cloning and heterologous expression of the gene for BLIP-II, a beta-lactamase-inhibitory protein from Streptomyces exfoliatus SMF19.	A beta-lactamase-inhibitory protein (BLIP-II) was purified from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces exfoliatus SMF 19 and its N-terminal amino acid sequence was determined. A clone containing the gene encoding BLIP-II (bliB) was selected from a cosmid library by colony hybridization using an oligonucleotide probe based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of BLIP-II. The bliB gene was isolated and sequenced. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed that the gene consists of 1116 bp and encodes a mature protein of 332 amino acids preceded by a 40 amino acid signal sequence. bliB, expressed under the control of the T7 promoter in Escherichia coli, was accumulated in an inactive form in inclusion bodies, but beta-lactamase-inhibitory activity was recovered after refolding. In addition, bliB was heterologously expressed in Streptomyces lividans TK24 using the melC1 promoter. The BLIP-II protein produced in recombinant strains of S. lividans was secreted into the culture supernatant in a biologically active form.	1998 Aug	Park H U,Lee K J	Microbiology (Reading, England). 144 ( Pt 8) 2161-7	Beta-lactamase inhibitory protein II	MPNGIVRLHRFGAALVMSGLLSALSAAPGVAAEPSSVSVAATSVVAWGGNNDWGEATVPAEAQSGVDAIAGGYFHGLALKGGKVLGWGANLNGQLTMPAATQSGVDAIAAGNYHSLALKDGEVIAWGGNEDGQTTVPAEARSGVDAIAAGAWASYALKDGKVIAWGDDSDGQTTVPAEAQSGVTALDGGVYTALAVKNGGVIAWGDNYFGQTTVPAEAQSGVDDVAGGIFHSLALKDGKVIAWGDNRYKQTTVPTEALSGVSAIASGEWYSLALKNGKVIAWGSSRTAPSSVQSGVSSIEAGPNAAYALKG		O87916			7	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8674812	Bacterial expression of human chorionic gonadotropin alpha subunit: studies on refolding, dimer assembly and interaction with two different beta subunits.	Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a member of a family of heterodimeric glycoprotein hormones that have a common alpha subunit but differ in their hormone-specific beta subunit. The common alpha subunit contains two asparagine (N)-linked oligosaccharides. To study the function of carbohydrates on in vitro refolding of alpha subunit and dimer assembly, we generated recombinant non-glycosylated hCG alpha subunit (rNGl-hCGalpha) from E. coli. The expression vector was constructed by inserting hCGalpha cDNA coding for the mature form in-frame into a pQE-30 vector, which contains a 6 x His sequence immediately before the 5&#39;-end of hCGalpha cDNA for subsequent purification of rNG-hCGalpha. The rNG-hCGalpha expressed in inclusion bodies was efficiently purified by immobilized metal chelate affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA resin. SDS-PAGE, solid-phase binding assay and immunoblotting demonstrated the expression of rNG-hCG. Its alpha molecular weight on SDS-PAGE was 14.7 kDa under reducing conditions and 15 kDa for a monomer accompanied with some higher molecular weight oligomer under non-reducing conditions. Reconstitution of rNG-hCGalpha with native hCGbeta and oFSHbeta occurred in very low yield under standard conditions. However, the oxidation-reduction system cystamine (1.34 mM) and cysteamine (7.3 mM) facilitated both the refolding of rNG-hCGalpha and reconstitution of rNG-hCGalpha with native hCGbeta to regain partially correct conformation. These were revealed by conformationally sensitive antibody and receptor binding assays. Cystamine and cysteamine were more effective in the recombination of rNG-hCGalpha with oFSHbeta as indicated by a 22-36-fold decrease in the amount required to cause a 50competitive inhibition in radioreceptor assay. They have no effect on assembly of rNG-hCGalpha with oLHbeta. Our results suggest the carbohydrate moieties confer greater conformational flexibility to the backbone of the beta subunit and the relative rigidity of the beta subunit may serve as a conformational template of the alpha subunit. The present approach has made it possible to prepare the non-glycosylated gonadotropin alpha subunit in adequate amounts for further study on their biological and topographical features in complete absence of carbohydrate.	1995 Aug	Ren P,Sairam M R,Yarney T A	Molecular and cellular endocrinology. 113(1) 39-51	Human chorionic gonadotropin alpha subunit	MDYYRKYAAIFLVTLSVFLHVLHSAPDVQDCPECTLQENPFFSQPGAPILQCMGCCFSRAYPTPLRSKKTMLVQKNVTSESTCCVAKSYNRVTVMGGFKVENHTACHCSTCYYHKS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P01215			6.1	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8260492	Molecular properties of pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme.	Pyruvate formate-lyase is a radical-containing enzyme that catalyzes the nonoxidative cleavage of pyruvate via a postulated homolytic mechanism. The formation of this enzymic radical in vitro requires an activating system composed of PFL-activating enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine, ferrous ion, a reduced flavin, DTT, and pyruvate as an allosteric effector. The need for large quantities of PFL-activating enzyme for biochemical and biophysical studies on the mechanism of protein radical formation has prompted us to clone the act gene and overexpress the gene product in Escherichia coli. Using PCR technology, the act gene was isolated and subcloned into various expression vectors. The overexpression of the protein was as high as 30-500f the total cellular protein. However, the majority of the protein resided in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. A procedure was developed to denature and isolate the inclusion bodies followed by refolding under anaerobic conditions. This purification method affords 5 mg of purified protein from 1 g of cells. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that the enzyme can bind one Fe(II) per protein monomer, and the protein did not exhibit any visible chromophore as previously observed. Co(II) and Cu(II) can be reconstituted into the protein with similar stoichiometries. Kinetic studies showed that the rate of radical formation was independent of ionic strength and the Km&#39;s for SAM and inactive PFL were determined to be 2.8 and 1.2 microM, respectively. Fluorescent binding data revealed that the Kd for SAM binding to the activating enzyme alone was comparable to the Km for SAM in the PFL activation indicating that the binding site for SAM resides on AE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1993 Dec	Wong K K,Murray B W,Lewisch S A,Baxter M K,Ridky T W,Ulissi-DeMario L,Kozarich J W	Biochemistry. 32(51) 14102-10	Pyruvate formate-lyase activating enzyme	MSVIGRIHSFESCGTVDGPGIRFITFFQGCLMRCLYCHNRDTWDTHGGKEVTVEDLMKEVVTYRHFMNASGGGVTASGGEAILQAEFVRDWFRACKKEGIHTCLDTNGFVRRYDPVIDELLEVTDLVMLDLKQMNDEIHQNLVGVSNHRTLEFAKYLANKNVKVWIRYVVVPGWSDDDDSAHRLGEFTRDMGNVEKIELLPYHELGKHKWVAMGEEYKLDGVKPPKKETMERVKGILEQYGHKVMF		P0A9N4			7.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7918533	Over-production, renaturation and reconstitution of delta and epsilon subunits from chloroplast and cyanobacterial F1.	We studied the functioning of chimeric F0F1-ATPases by replacing subunits delta and epsilon of spinach CF1 with their counterparts from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The sequence identities between these subunits are 26 and 41%, respectively. For a systematic approach to such studies and later extension to genetically modified subunits recombinant proteins are required. The genes coding for spinach and Synechocystis delta and epsilon were cloned into pET3 expression vectors and expressed in Escherichia coli. Upon expression at 37 degrees C the recombinant subunits formed inclusion bodies within the host cells except for spinach delta, which was soluble. Synechocystis delta and epsilon could be obtained in soluble form upon expression at 20 degrees C. After purification (and refolding of spinach epsilon) both epsilon subunits inhibited the Ca(2+)-ATPase activity of soluble CF1(- epsilon). Subunits delta and epsilon from both species raised the rate of ATP synthesis in partially CF1-depleted spinach thylakoids when added together with CF1(- delta) or CF1(- delta, epsilon). This showed the functionality of recombinant Synechocystis and spinach delta and epsilon together with spinach alpha 3 beta 3 gamma. The molar excess of epsilon necessary for saturation was higher for Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibition than for reconstitution of photophosphorylation thus pointing to a direct interaction between epsilon and both CF1 and CF0.	1994 Sep	Steinemann D,Lill H,Junge W,Engelbrecht S	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1187(3) 354-9	ATP synthase epsilon chain	MTLNLCVLTPNRSIWNSEVKEIILSTNSGQIGVLPNHAPTATAVDIGILRIRLNDQWLTLALMGGFARIGNNEITILVNDAERGSDIDPQEAQQTLEIAEANLRKAEGKRQKIEANLALRRARTRVEASNTISS		P00833			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The cDNA encoding Mn peroxidase isozyme H4 from Phanerochaete chrysosporium was expressed in Escherichia coli. The portion of the cDNA encoding the enzyme&#39;s signal peptide, not found in the processed holoenzyme, was deleted from the cDNA. The polypeptide was produced as inactive inclusion bodies that could be solubilized in 8 M urea and the reducing agent dithiothreitol. Reconstitution of activity was accomplished by diluting the urea concentration to 2M in the presence of hemin, calcium, and oxidized glutathione. All of the additives were required for recovery of activity. The activity of the recombinant enzyme was dependent on both Mn2+ and H2O2.	1995 Nov	Whitwam R E,Gazarian I G,Tien M	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 216(3) 1013-7	Manganese peroxidase	MAFGSLLAFVALAAITRAAPTAESAVCPDGTRVTNAACCAFIPLAQDLQETLFQGDCGEDAHEVIRLTFHDAIAISQSLGPQAGGGADGSMLHFPTIEPNFSANNGIDDSVNNLLPFMQKHDTISAADLVQFAGAVALSNCPGAPRLEFMAGRPNTTIPAVEGLIPEPQDSVTKILQRFEDAGNFSPFEVVSLLASHTVARADKVDETIDAAPFDSTPFTFDTQVFLEVLLKGTGFPGSNNNTGEVMSPLPLGSGSDTGEMRLQSDFALARDERTACFWQSFVNEQEFMAASFKAAMAKLAILGHSRSSLIDCSDVVPVPKPAVNKPATFPATKGPKDLDTLTCKALKFPTLTSDPGATETLIPHCSNGGMSCPGVQFDGPA		Q12170			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7744077	The preparation of catalytically active human cathepsin B from its precursor expressed in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies.	A cDNA clone encoding human procathepsin B was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli using a T7 polymerase expression system, resulting in the formation of insoluble cytoplasmic protein aggregates (inclusion bodies). The recombinant product was solubilized and renatured by refolding and reoxidation. The proenzyme was subsequently processed with pepsin to produce an enzymically active enzyme. By systematic variation of the parameters influencing the folding, formation of disulphide bonds, and processing of procathepsin B to the catalytically active mature form, a simple renaturation procedure was designed, allowing the production of about 3 mg purified active cathepsin B/l E. coli culture broth. The enzyme obtained in this way consists of a single chain and, as a consequence of pepsin treatment, possesses a three-amino-acid extension at its N-terminus. The enzyme has similar kinetic and immunological properties to native human cathepsin B.	1995 Apr	Kuhelj R,Dolinar M,Pungercar J,Turk V	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 229(2) 533-9	Cathepsin B	MWQLWASLCCLLVLANARSRPSFHPLSDELVNYVNKRNTTWQAGHNFYNVDMSYLKRLCGTFLGGPKPPQRVMFTEDLKLPASFDAREQWPQCPTIKEIRDQGSCGSCWAFGAVEAISDRICIHTNAHVSVEVSAEDLLTCCGSMCGDGCNGGYPAEAWNFWTRKGLVSGGLYESHVGCRPYSIPPCEHHVNGSRPPCTGEGDTPKCSKICEPGYSPTYKQDKHYGYNSYSVSNSEKDIMAEIYKNGPVEGAFSVYSDFLLYKSGVYQHVTGEMMGGHAIRILGWGVENGTPYWLVANSWNTDWGDNGFFKILRGQDHCGIESEVVAGIPRTDQYWEKI		P07858			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7756839	In vitro refolding of cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase from cytoplasmic inclusion bodies formed upon expression in Escherichia coli.	The recovery of active cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase (CGT) from inclusion bodies formed upon expression of a signal sequence deletion mutant (cgt delta ss) gene in Escherichia coli was studied. Under the conditions examined the in vitro renaturation yield of active enzyme was up to 810f the maximum activity from urea solubilized and up to 3.7 0.000000rom guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) solubilized inclusion bodies. Refolding from GdmCl solutions resulted in the reaggregation of delta ss CGT. Although native (folded) CGT showed enzymatic activity at urea concentrations as high as 10 M, the inclusion bodies could be solubilized with 3 M urea solution, but the preparation had no enzymatic activity prior to reduction of the denaturant concentration. This suggests that the delta ssCGT inclusion bodies are composed of molecules that are trapped in an inactive state. The individual molecules may have extensive secondary structure, since inclusion bodies solubilized with 4.5 M urea gave maximum yield of activity in the renaturation step. With higher urea concentration the yield decreased. Thus, a &quot;mild&quot; solubilization technique seems to increase the yield of active delta ssCGT from the inclusion bodies. The stability of the refolded delta ssCGT was identical to that of extracellularly produced wild type CGT, whereas a disulfide bond mutant, Ser-70-CGT, showed reduced stability under identical conditions. This suggests that the single disulfide bond in delta ssCGT is formed during refolding and contributes to the stability of the molecule. A fusion of maltose binding protein to the NH2-terminus of delta ssCGT did not significantly affect the in vitro folding of the delta ssCGT portion when tested by a denaturation-renaturation experiment.	1995 Feb	Hellman J,Lassila P,Mäntsälä P	Protein expression and purification. 6(1) 56-62	Cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase	MKSRYKRLTSLALSLSMALGISLPAWASPDTSVDNKVNFSTDVIYQIVTDRFADGDRTNNPAGDAFSGDRSNLKLYFGGDWQGIIDKINDGYLTGMGVTALWISQPVENITSVIKYSGVNNTSYHGYWARDFKQTNDAFGDFADFQNLIDTAHAHNIKVVIDFAPNHTSPADRDNPGFAENGGMYDNGSLLGAYSNDTAGLFHHNGGTDFSTIEDGIYKNLYDLADINHNNNAMDAYFKSAIDLWLGMGVDGIRFDAVKHMPFGWQKSFVSSIYGGDHPVFTFGEWYLGADQTDGDNIKFANESGMNLLDFEYAQEVREVFRDKTETMKDLYEVLASTESQYDYINNMVTFIDNHDMDRFQVAGSGTRATEQALALTLTSRGVPAIYYGTEQYMTGDGDPNNRAMMTSFNTGTTAYKVIQALAPLRKSNPAIAYGTTTERWVNNDVLIIERKFGSSAALVAINRNSSAAYPISGLLSSLPAGTYSDVLNGLLNGNSITVGSGGAVTNFTLAAGGTAVWQYTAPETSPAIGNVGPTMGQPGNIVTIDGRGFGGTAGTVYFGTTAVTGSGIVSWEDTQIKAVIPKVAAGKTGVSVKTSSGTASNTFKSFNVLTGDQVTVRFLVNQANTNYGTNVYLVGNAAELGSWDPNKAIGPMYNQVIAKYPSWYYDVSVPAGTKLDFKFIKKGGGTVTWEGGGNHTYTTPASGVGTVTVDWQN		P04830			8	8	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9654075	Engineering, expression and biochemical characterization of the hemoglobin domain of a Erwinia chrysanthemi flavohemoprotein.	An artificial hemoglobin-like domain has been constructed by engineering the gene coding for the multi-domain flavohemoprotein from the bacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi. This domain was designed by molecular modelling, cloned and over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The holo-protein was obtained in large quantities after extraction from inclusion bodies and refolding in presence of alkaline hemin. The purified 140-residue domain was studied and characterized to gain new insights into the biochemical function of the recombinant domain and the biological role of this new flavohemoprotein. The structural and functional features of this domain in solution were studied using far-ultraviolet circular dichroism, resonance Raman, proton-NMR spectroscopy, flash laser photolysis and molecular modelling. The recombinant domain is shown to be folded properly and active. This hemoglobin-like domain is able to bind oxygen and carbon monoxide with very high affinity. It exhibits a rapid auto-oxidation which may explain its tight association with a flavin containing reductase domain. A functional model of this hemoglobin is discussed and compared with the X-ray structures of other hemoproteins.	1998 May	Labesse G,Craescu C T,Mispelter J,Chottard G,Marden M C,Pin S,Forest E,Mornon J P,Boccara M	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 253(3) 751-9	Flavohemoprotein (Globin domain)	MLDQQTIATIKSTIPLLAETGPALTAHFYQRMFHHNPELKDIFNMSNQRNGDQREALFNAICAYATHIENLPALLPAVERIAQKHASFNIQPEQYQIVGTHLLATLEEMFQPGQAVLDAWGKRYGVLANVFIQRESDIYQQSAGQNGGWHGIRPFRIVAKQPQSSLITSFTLEPVDGGPIAAFRPGQYLAVYIRDKRFEYQEIRQYSLTNEPNGRYYRIAVKRETMGSVSGYLHDVAREGDVIELAAPHGDFYLEVTPETPVALISAGVGQTPMLSMLHSLKNQQHQADIFWLHAAENTEVHAFADEIADVAATLPQLQSYVWYREASSEAARSAHAFHGLMALKDLPTPLPMTNLHCYLCGPVAFMQFAARQLLELGITESQIHYECFGPHKVI		Q47266			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
8811884	Purification and characterization of decorin core protein expressed in Escherichia coli as a maltose-binding protein fusion.	Decorin is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan which is a component of the extracellular matrix of many connective tissues. We have developed a method for expression and purification of decorin as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli. A PCR product coding for the 330-amino-acid-residue secreted form of bovine decorin core protein was cloned into the vector pMal-c for expression in E. coli as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion. Expressed MBP-decorin tended to form insoluble aggregates resistant to degradation by E. coli intracellular proteases. Fusion protein was therefore solubilized from bacterial inclusion bodies using guanidine HCl and refolded by dilution of the chaotrope to minimally denaturing conditions and disulfide shuffling. Final purification included amylose resin affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The 79-kDa MBP-decorin fusion protein could be completely cleaved by factor Xa protease in 24 h to yield 43-kDa MBP and 36-kDa decorin core protein. The decorin core protein was separated from MBP and factor Xa protease by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography. Using a solid-phase assay, we have characterized its binding affinity for extracellular matrix components known to interact with tissue-derived decorin including collagen type VI, collagen type I, and fibronectin. The purification and refolding protocol described here may be generally applicable to bacterial expression of other members of this growing family of related small leucine-rich proteoglycan core proteins.	1996 Aug	Hering T M,Kollar J,Huynh T D,Varelas J B	Analytical biochemistry. 240(1) 98-108	Decorin	MKATIIFLLVAQVSWAGPFQQKGLFDFMLEDEASGIGPEEHFPEVPEIEPMGPVCPFRCQCHLRVVQCSDLGLEKVPKDLPPDTALLDLQNNKITEIKDGDFKNLKNLHTLILINNKISKISPGAFAPLVKLERLYLSKNQLKELPEKMPKTLQELRVHENEITKVRKSVFNGLNQMIVVELGTNPLKSSGIENGAFQGMKKLSYIRIADTNITTIPQGLPPSLTELHLDGNKITKVDAASLKGLNNLAKLGLSFNSISAVDNGSLANTPHLRELHLNNNKLVKVPGGLADHKYIQVVYLHNNNISAIGSNDFCPPGYNTKKASYSGVSLFSNPVQYWEIQPSTFRCVYVRAAVQLGNYK	N-terminal maltose binding protein	P21793			9	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8670100	Expression of lignin peroxidase H8 in Escherichia coli: folding and activation of the recombinant enzyme with Ca2+ and haem.	An engineered cDNA from Phanerochaete chrysosporium encoding both the mature and pro-sequence regions of Lip isoenzyme H8 (Lip) has been successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein (LipP*) was sequestered in inclusion bodies. The reduced-denatured polypeptide has been purified by differential solubilization, and the active enzyme recovered after controlled in vitro refolding (albeit in low yield), by glutathione-mediated oxidation of disulphides, in a folding medium containing an intermediate concentration of urea, Ca2+, and haem. The procedure is analogous to that previously described for the production of active recombinant horseradish peroxidase (HRP-C*) from inclusion-body material. It is quite possible, therefore, that this type of procedure may be suitable for the recovery of most, if not all, active recombinant peroxidases. The resultant LipP* has spectral characteristics identical with that of the native enzyme as isolated from Phanerochaete chrysosporium. Its specific activity measured in the standard veratryl alcohol (VA) assay was 39 micromol of VA oxidized/min per mg of protein, a value which compares extremely favourably with that of the native enzyme (36 micromol of VA/min per mg). Although levels of active enzyme obtained are not yet as high as in the case of HRP-C* (1conversion of crude inactive LipP* polypeptide into pure fully active Lip), it is envisaged that further refinement of the expression/folding/activation procedures will provide sufficient protein for biophysical characterization of both the wild-type and site-directed mutants.	1996 Apr	Doyle W A,Smith A T	The Biochemical journal. 315 ( Pt 1) 15-9	Lignin peroxidase	MALKQLAAAVALALSIQAAQGAAVKEKRATCSNGATVGDASSCAWFDVLDDIQQNLFNGAQCGAEAHESIRLVFHDAIAISPALESQGKFGGGGADGSIILFDDIETNFHPNIGLDEIVNLQKPFIQKHGVTPGDFIAFAGAVAMSNCPGAPQMNFFTGRAPATQAAPDGLVPEPFHTVDQIISRVNDAGEFDELELVWMLSAHSVAAANDVDPTIQGLAFDSTPGVFDSQFFVETQLRGTAFPGSGGNQGEVESPLPGEMRLQSDSSIARDSRTACEWQSFVNNQSKLVSDFQFIFLALTQLGENPDAMTDCSDVIPISKPVPNNVPFSFFPAGKTMADVEQACAETPFPTLTTLPGPETSVQRIPPPGA		Q01787			8.3	20	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8713124	High-yield production of Saccharomycopsis fibuligera glucoamylase in Escherichia coli, refolding, and comparison of the nonglycosylated and glycosylated enzyme forms.	The truncated GLA1 gene encoding the mature form of glucoamylase from the yeast Saccharomycopsis fibuligera has been over-expressed in Escherichia coli using the IPTG inducible pET system. Over-expression has led to the accumulation of insoluble glucoamylase in inclusion bodies from which an electrophoretically homogeneous active enzyme has been prepared yielding 30 mg per litre medium. This protein represents an N-terminus Met-free, non-glycosylated product which displays the identical specific activity of 45 units/mg and reduced thermal stability when compared to glycosylated enzymes isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae carrying the GLA1 gene. These data suggest that S. cerevisiae glycosylation of S. fibuligera glucoamylase does not play a critical role in enzymatic activity but that it does contribute to its thermal stability.	1996 Jul	Solovicová A,Gasperík J,Hostinová E	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 224(3) 790-5	Glucoamylase	MIRLTVFLTAVFAAVASCVPVELDKRNTGHFQAYSGYTVARSNFTQWIHEQPAVSWYYLLQNIDYPEGQFKSAKPGVVVASPSTSEPDYFYQWTRDTAITFLSLIAEVEDHSFSNTTLAKVVEYYISNTYTLQRVSNPSGNFDSPNHDGLGEPKFNVDDTAYTASWGRPQNDGPALRAYAISRYLNAVAKHNNGKLLLAGQNGIPYSSASDIYWKIIKPDLQHVSTHWSTSGFDLWEENQGTHFFTALVQLKALSYGIPLSKTYNDPGFTSWLEKQKDALNSYINSSGFVNSGKKHIVESPQLSSRGGLDSATYIAALITHDIGDDDTYTPFNVDNSYVLNSLYYLLVDNKNRYKINGNYKAGAAVGRYPEDVYNGVGTSEGNPWQLATAYAGQTFYTLAYNSLKNKKNLVIEKLNYDLYNSFIADLSKIDSSYASKDSLTLTYGSDNYKNVIKSLLQFGDSFLKVLLDHIDDNGQLTEEINRYTGFQAGAVSLTWSSGSLLSANRARNKLIELL		Q8TFE5			7.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11106176	Purification and refolding of vascular endothelial growth factor-B.	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGF-R1 and R2, and the importance of this interaction in endothelial cell (EC) function and blood vessel development has been well documented. Other ligands that interact differentially with these receptors and that are structurally related to VEGF-A include VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and placenta growth factor (PLGF). Compared with VEGF-A, relatively little is known about the biological role of the VEGF-R1 specific ligand, VEGF-B. Two splice variant isoforms that differ at the COOH-terminus and which retain unique solubility characteristics are widely expressed throughout embryonic and postnatal development. Recent analysis of mice with a targeted deletion of the VEGF-B gene has revealed a defect in heart development and function consistent with an important role in vascularization of the myocardium (Bellomo D et al., 2000, Circ Res 86:E29-E35). To facilitate further characterization of VEGF-B, we have developed a protocol for expression and purification of refolded recombinant protein from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies (IBs). The approach developed resolves a number of significant issues associated with VEGF-B, including the ability to heterodimerize with endogenous VEGF-A when co-expressed in mammalian cells, a complex secondary structure incorporating inter- and intrachain disulfide bonds and hydrophobic characteristics that preclude the use of standard chromatographic resins. The resulting purified disulfide-linked homodimer was demonstrated to bind to VEGF-R1 and to compete with VEGF-A for binding to this receptor.	2000 Oct	Scrofani S D,Fabri L J,Xu P,Maccarone P,Nash A D	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 9(10) 2018-25	Vascular endothelial growth factor B	MSPLLRRLLLAALLQLAPAQAPVSQPDAPGHQRKVVSWIDVYTRATCQPREVVVPLTVELMGTVAKQLVPSCVTVQRCGGCCPDDGLECVPTGQHQVRMQILMIRYPSSQLGEMSLEEHSQCECRPKKKDSAVKPDRAATPHHRPQPRSVPGWDSAPGAPSPADITHPTPAPGPSAHAAPSTTSALTPGPAAAAADAAASSVAKGGA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P49765			8.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12880778	Isolation of the gene and large-scale expression and purification of recombinant Erythrina cristagalli lectin.	Using polymerase chain reaction, the coding sequence for Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL) has been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The amplified DNA sequence of ECL is highly homologous to that previously reported for Erythrina corallodendron lectin (ECorL), confirming the absence of introns in the ECL gene. The polypeptide sequences of ECL and ECorL have been compared and five amino acids have been identified that differentiate the two proteins. Recombinant E. cristagalli lectin (recECL) was expressed in E. coli from a genomic clone encoding the mature E. cristagalli lectin gene. Constitutive expression localised recombinant protein in inclusion bodies, which were solubilised, and recECL, subsequently refolded and purified by lactose affinity chromatography. Significant advantages were observed for purification from inclusion bodies rather than from a clone optimised to express soluble protein. A large-scale purification scheme has been developed that can prepare functional recECL from inclusion bodies with a yield of 870 mg/l culture. By the range of characterisation methods employed in this study, it has been demonstrated that recECL is functionally equivalent to native ECL obtained from the E. cristagalli plant. In addition, characterisation of the binding of radiolabelled recECL to cultured dorsal root ganglia demonstrated that recECL binds to a single pool of receptors.	2003 Aug	Stancombe Patrick R,Alexander Frances C G,Ling Roger,Matheson Mary A,Shone Clifford C,Chaddock John A	Protein expression and purification. 30(2) 283-92	Lectin	VETISFSFSEFEPGNDNLTLQGAALITQSGVLQLTKINQNGMPAWDSTGRTLYTKPVHMWDSTTGTVASFETRFSFSIEQPYTRPLPADGLVFFMGPTKSKPAQGYGYLGVFNNSKQDNSYQTLAVEFDTFSNPWDPPQVPHIGIDVNSIRSIKTQPFQLDNGQVANVVIKYDAPSKILHVVLVYPSSGAIYTIAEIVDVKQVLPDWVDVGLSGATGAQRDAAETHDVYSWSFQASLPE		P83410			10.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12821318	Construction of an overproducing strain, purification, and biochemical characterization of the 6His-Eco29kI restriction endonuclease.	We constructed a strain of Escherichia coli overproducing 6His-tagged Eco29kI by placing the coding sequence under control of a strong bacteriophage T5 promoter. The yield of 6His-Eco29kI restriction endonuclease expression could be increased to about 200f the total cellular protein, but inclusion bodies formed consisting of insoluble 6His-Eco29kI protein. We developed a fast and effective protocol for purification of the homogeneous enzyme from both soluble and insoluble fractions and established their identity by catalytic activity assay. The isolated enzymes were tested for recognition specificity and optimal reaction conditions as a function of NaCl and KCl concentrations, temperature, and pH compared with the native Eco29kI restriction endonuclease. The 6His-tagged enzyme retained the specificity of the native protein but had an altered optimum of its catalytic reaction.	2003 Jul	Nikitin Dmitri,Mokrishcheva Marina,Denjmukhametov Marat,Pertzev Alexander,Zakharova Marina,Solonin Alexander	Protein expression and purification. 30(1) 26-31	Eco29kI restriction endonuclease	MHNKKFDRSEHVYRNDSFLELIKDAVRFFSGTPVHSLPPPERFQGAGVYALYYTGHYSLYDEYSRINRLAYNLPIYVGKAVPAGWRQSRISDHETRAGSELSNRIREHGRNIAKTSNLDLCDFSCRFVIFEATGSDMISTVEAALIKIYKPLWNTVVDGFGNHTPGAGRFAQAKSDWDVIHPGREWAEKCTGVHSEPYFIEERIKQYFSKSNFT	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q46944			7.2	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7765234	High-level expression of Mycoplasma arginine deiminase in Escherichia coli and its efficient renaturation as an anti-tumor enzyme.	The arginine deiminase (AD) gene was cloned from Mycoplasma arginini and expressed in the cytosol of Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies with an expression level of at least 200f the total bacterial proteins. The inclusion bodies were solubilized with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (Gdn-HCl) under reducing conditions, in order to avoid incorrect disulfide-bond formation of the recombinant (r-) AD molecules, and renaturation was performed under various refolding conditions. The optimum renaturation conditions were found to be incubation for 90 h at pH 7.5 and 15 degrees C. The resulting completely refolded r-AD was purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange and arginine-affinity chromatography and its activity yield was 72.5%. The specific activity of the purified r-AD was comparable to and its amino acid composition was identical to those of Mycoplasma AD, and NH2-terminal sequence analysis revealed that its methionine residue corresponding to the translation initiation codon had been removed completely. Anti-tumor activity analyses showed that r-AD inhibited the growth of two mouse cell lines, hepatoma MH134 and fibrosarcoma Meth A, strongly in vitro at concentrations in excess of 10 ng ml-1. Moreover, when MH134-implanted mice were given single intravenous injections of r-AD at doses of 50 mg kg-1 and higher, their survival times were prolonged significantly. These results, taken together, indicate that the enzymatic properties and biological actions of r-AD were highly consistent with those of Mycoplasma AD.	1994 Aug	Misawa S,Aoshima M,Takaku H,Matsumoto M,Hayashi H	Journal of biotechnology. 36(2) 145-55	Arginine Deiminase	MSVFDSKFKGIHVYSEIGELESVLVHEPGREIDYITPARLDELLFSAILESHDARKEHKQFVAELKANDINVVELIDLVAETYDLASQEAKDKLIEEFLEDSEPVLSEEHKVVVRNFLKAKKTSRELVEIMMAGITKYDLGIEADHELIVDPMPNLYFTRDPFASVGNGVTIHYMRYKVRQRETLFSRFVFSNHPKLINTPWYYDPSLKLSIEGGDVFIYNNDTLVVGVSERTDLQTVTLLAKNIVANKECEFKRIVAINVPKWTNLMHLDTWLTMLDKDKFLYSPIANDVFKFWDYDLVNGGAEPQPVENGLPLEGLLQSIINKKPVLIPIAGEGASQMEIERETHFDGTNYLAIRPGVVIGYSRNEKTNAALEAAGIKVLPFHGNQLSLGMGNARCMSMPLSRKDVKW		P23793			7.5	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1744569	Production and purification of biologically active recombinant tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) prolactins.	Recombinant expression vectors carrying tilapia prolactin-I or -II (tiPRL-I or tiPRL-II) cDNA were constructed and the tiPRL-I and II proteins were produced in E. coli as inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies were dissolved in 6 mol urea/l. Refolding of the proteins was followed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions so as to visualize the oxidized state of the molecules. Proteins tiPRL-I and tiPRL-II were purified by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. The N-terminal sequence and bioactivities of both purified proteins were then analysed. Recombinant tiPRL-I and tiPRL-II induced a significant rise in plasma calcium levels as well as in mucocyte density in the abdominal skin epithelium. When tested on kidney membrane, both proteins exhibited potency in competing with 125I-labelled tiPRL-I for binding sites, but tiPRL-I seemed to be more potent than tiPRL-II in competing for these sites.

The devR-devS (Rv 3133c-Rv 3132c) two-component system of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was identified in our laboratory by RNA subtractive hybridization. This genetic system was predicted to encode a response regulator and histidine protein kinase, respectively. The putative histidine kinase protein DevS was overexpressed to high levels in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with a hexahistidine tag, His(6)-DevS201, in the form of inclusion bodies. Here we report a &quot;redox-based&quot; method of matrix-bound renaturation of DevS protein. The refolded protein was biochemically active in an autophosphorylation reaction characteristic of histidine kinases and was suitable for the generation of polyclonal antibodies and as an antigen in ELISA.	2002 Jun	Saini Deepak Kumar,Pant Neha,Das Taposh K,Tyagi Jaya Sivaswami	Protein expression and purification. 25(1) 203-8	DevS Histidine Protein Kinase	MTTGGLVDENDGAAMRPLRHTLSQLRLHELLVEVQDRVEQIVEGRDRLDGLVEAMLVVTAGLDLEATLRAIVHSATSLVDARYGAMEVHDRQHRVLHFVYEGIDEETVRRIGHLPKGLGVIGLLIEDPKPLRLDDVSAHPASIGFPPYHPPMRTFLGVPVRVRDESFGTLYLTDKTNGQPFSDDDEVLVQALAAAAGIAVANARLYQQAKARQSWIEATRDIATELLSGTEPATVFRLVAAEALKLTAADAALVAVPVDEDMPAADVGELLVIETVGSAVASTVGRTIPVAGAVLREVFVNGIPRRVDRVDLEGLDELADAGPALLLPLRARGTVAGVVVVLSQGGPGAFTDEQLEMMAAFADQAALAWQLATSQRRMRELDVLTDRDRIARDLHDHVIQRLFAIGLALQGAVPHERNPEVQQRLSDVVDDLQDVIQEIRTTIYDLHGASQGITRLRQRIDAAVAQFADSGLRTSVQFVGPLSVVDSALADQAEAVVREAVSNAVRHAKASTLTVRVKVDDDLCIEVTDNGRGLPDEFTGSGLTNLRQRAEQAGGEFTLASVPGASGTVLRWSAPLSQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q7TX69			8	16	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10653159	Bacterial expression and refolding of different fragments of human CD14.	We have investigated bacterial expression of several fragments of CD14, a human cellular receptor for lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Despite binding of CD14 to the LPS, a vital constituent of bacterial outer membrane, we have succeeded in producing full length recombinant hCD14 in E. coli. High level of production of CD14 resulted in deposits of aggregated CD14 in bacteria in form of inclusion bodies, which made production of this protein possible. We have also produced N-terminal fragments consisting of 134 and 152 residues, which comprise N-terminal domain with 2 and 3 leucine rich repeats, respectively and a fragment that contains only leucine rich repeats. Production of the N-terminal domain consisting of 69 residues could not be detected, probably due to the degradation of the produced protein within the bacteria. Full length CD14 and a fragment of 152 residues from inclusion bodies were refolded, while the 134 residues fragment and the one with 10 leucine-rich repeats could not be refolded. Those results confirm that the minimal folding unit of CD14 must include N-terminal domain and at least 3 leucine rich repeats.	2000 	Majerle A,Kidric J,Jerala R	Pflügers Archiv : European journal of physiology. 439(3 Suppl) R109-10	CD14	MERASCLLLLLLPLVHVSATTPEPCELDDEDFRCVCNFSEPQPDWSEAFQCVSAVEVEIHAGGLNLEPFLKRVDADADPRQYADTVKALRVRRLTVGAAQVPAQLLVGALRVLAYSRLKELTLEDLKITGTMPPLPLEATGLALSSLRLRNVSWATGRSWLAELQQWLKPGLKVLSIAQAHSPAFSCEQVRAFPALTSLDLSDNPGLGERGLMAALCPHKFPAIQNLALRNTGMETPTGVCAALAAAGVQPHSLDLSHNSLRATVNPSAPRCMWSSALNSLNLSFAGLEQVPKGLPAKLRVLDLSCNRLNRAPQPDELPEVDNLTLDGNPFLVPGTALPHEGSMNSGVVPACARSTLSVGVSGTLVLLQGARGFA		P08571			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2158928	High-level synthesis of recombinant HIV-1 protease and the recovery of active enzyme from inclusion bodies.	A complete chemical synthesis and assembly of genes for the production of human immunodeficiency virus type-I protease (HIV-PR) and its precursors are described. The T7 expression system was used to produce high levels of active HIV-PR and its precursors in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. The gene encoding the open reading frames of HIV-PR was expressed in E. coli as a 10-kDa protein, while the genes encoding HIV-PR precursors were expressed as larger proteins, which were partially processed in E. coli to the 10-kDa form. These processing events are autoproteolytic, since a single-base mutation, changing the active-site aspartic acid to glycine, completely abolished the conversion. HIV-PR can be released with 8 M urea from washed cellular inclusion bodies, resulting in a preparation with few bacterial host proteins. After refolding, this preparation contains no nonspecific protease or peptidase activities. The recombinant HIV-PR isolated from inclusion bodies cleaves HIV-PR substrates specifically with a specific activity comparable to column-purified HIV-PR.	1990 Mar	Cheng Y S,McGowan M H,Kettner C A,Schloss J V,Erickson-Viitanen S,Yin F H	Gene. 87(2) 243-8	Retropepsin	PQITLWQRPLVTIRIGGQLKEALLDTGADDTVLEEMNLPGKWKPKMIGGIGGFIKVRQYDQIPVEICGHKAIGTVLVGPTPVNIIGRNLLTQIGCTLNF		P03369			5.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2853948	Inhibitorily active recombinant human stefin B. Gene synthesis, expression and isolation of an inhibitory active MS-2 pol-stefin B fusion protein and preparation of Des[Met1,2(2)]stefin B.	A synthetic gene coding for the human intracellular cysteine proteinase inhibitor, stefin B, was constructed from 13 chemically synthesized oligonucleotides according to the method of Khorana. The gene was inserted into the plasmid vector pTZ, amplified and sequenced. For expression, a temperature-inducible system producing fusion proteins was used. With the vector pEx31A containing the synthetic cystatin B gene, E. coli strain 537 produced a fusion protein of the N-terminal part of bacteriophage MS-2 polymerase and [Met-2Gly-1]stefin B. Lysates of the induced bacteria were inhibitorily active against papain. The fusion protein was expressed in high yield (about 200f total E. coli proteins) and mostly deposited as inclusion bodies. The unfolded fusion protein was partially purified in the presence of urea. After refolding, approx. 60f the protein was inhibitorily active against papain, human cathepsin H and B. Des[Met1,2(2)]stefin B was released by cyanogen bromide cleavage of the fusion protein and identified by N-terminal amino-acid sequence analysis. The non-separated cleavage products were also inhibitorily active after refolding. The estimated inhibition constants for the fusion protein and its cleavage products were similar to those reported for natural stefin B.	1988 Oct	Thiele U,Auerswald E A,Gebhard W,Assfalg-Machleidt I,Popović T,Machleidt W	Biological chemistry Hoppe-Seyler. 369(10) 1167-78	Stefin B	MMCGAPSATQPATAETQHIADQVRSQLEEKENKKFPVFKAVSFKSQVVAGTNYFIKVHVGDEDFVHLRVFQSLPHENKPLTLSNYQTNKAKHDELTYF	N-terminal MS-2 polymerase	P04080			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) constitute a family of secreted glycoproteins involved in regulating extracellular matrix degradation in both normal and malignant tissues. We have expressed a cDNA clone of mouse TIMP-1 as a 22-kDa protein with 12 cysteine residues in E. coli and purified protein that shows inhibitory activity against collagenase following renaturation by chemical means. The low specific activity and circular dichroism measurements suggest, however, that the renaturation of the mouse recombinant (non-glycosylated) protein is not efficient under the conditions we have used, indicative of either thermodynamic instability or the transition to kinetic intermediates which have very low in vitro refolding rates.	1992 Aug	Cocuzzi E T,Walther S E,Rajan S,Denhardt D T	FEBS letters. 307(3) 375-8	Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase	MMAPFASLASGILLLLSLIASSKACSCAPPHPQTAFCNSDLVIRAKFMGSPEINETTLYQRYKIKMTKMLKGFKAVGNAADIRYAYTPVMESLCGYAHKSQNRSEEFLITGRLRNGNLHISACSFLVPWRTLSPAQQRAFSKTYSAGCGVCTVFPCLSIPCKLESDTHCLWTDQVLVGSEDYQSRHFACLPRNPGLCTWRSLGAR		P12032			9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9535697	Renaturation of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase expressed in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies into a dimeric and catalytically active enzyme.	1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase is a key enzyme regulating the biosynthesis of the plant hormone ethylene. A wound-inducible zucchini ACC synthase cDNA was isolated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and expressed in a heterologous Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS:pET30a protein expression system. A method was developed and optimized for the renaturation of the ACC synthase expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. The optimum conditions were found to be unfolding in a buffer containing 100 mM Mops, pH 9.5, 6 M urea, and 50 mM DTT, for 3 h at 4 degrees C and refolding by a combined process of dialysis and dilution in 100 mM Mops, pH 8, 30 mM Chaps, and 5 mM GSH at a protein concentration of 45 microg/ml. The purified enzyme has a specific activity of 90,000 U mg-1 and exhibits an apparent homogeneity on SDS-PAGE fractionation. Biochemical characterization of the refolded enzyme revealed a high degree of similarity to the enzyme purified from the soluble source. The refolded enzyme was found to be a dimer with a native size of 110 kDa, a Km of 23 microM, and a Vmax of 112,000 U mg-1.	1998 Apr	Huxtable S,Zhou H,Wong S,Li N	Protein expression and purification. 12(3) 305-14	1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase	MRGSHHHHHHMGFHQIDERNQALLSKIALDDGHGENSPYFDGWKAYDNDPFHPENNPLGVIQMGLAENQLSFDMIVDWIRKHPEASICTPEGLERFKSIANFQDYHGLPEFRNAIANFMGKVRGGRVKFDPSRIVMGGGATGASETVIFCLADPGDAFLVPSPYYAGFDRDLKWRTRAQIIRVHCNGSNNFQVTKAALEIAYKKAQEANMKVKGVIITNPSNPLGTTYDRDTLKTLVTFVNQHDIHLICDEIYSATVFKAPTFTSIAEIVEQMEHCKKELIHILYSLSKDMGLPGFRVGIIYSYNDVVVRRARQMSSFGLVSSQTQHLLAAMLSDEDFVDKFLAENSKRVGERHARFTKELDKMGITCLNSNAGVFVWMDLRRLLKDQTFKAEMELWRVIINEVKLNVSPGSSFHVTEPGWFRVCFANMDDNTVDVALNRIHSFVENIDKKEDNTVAMPSKTRHRDNKLRLSFSFSGRRYDEGNVLNSPHTMSPHSPLVIAKN	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P23279			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12963344	Refolding from denatured inclusion bodies, purification to homogeneity and simplified assay of MGDG synthases from land plants.	In plant cells, the synthesis of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is catalyzed within plastid envelope membranes by MGD proteins. MGDG synthesis was also reported in apicomplexan parasites, a phylum of protists harbouring a plastid that proved essential for the parasite survival. MGD activity is therefore a potent target for herbicidal and anti-parasitic molecules. In this study, we describe a detailed in vitro refolding protocol for denatured recombinant MGD accumulated in inclusion bodies from transformed Escherichia coli. The refolding process was dependent on CHAPS detergent and lipids, such as diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, as well as bivalent metals. Owing to this refolding procedure, the recombinant MGD protein from spinach was purified to homogeneity, allowing a definite characterization of its non-processivity and an investigation of its dimerization using cross-linking reagents. Additionally, using the portion of recombinant enzyme that accumulates in an active form in bacterial membranes, we developed a miniature assay for high-throughput screening for inhibitors.	2003 Sep	Nishiyama Yoshitaka,Hardré-Liénard Hélène,Miras Stéphane,Miège Christine,Block Maryse A,Revah Frédéric,Joyard Jacques,Maréchal Eric	Protein expression and purification. 31(1) 79-87	Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase	MSHPSTVTSEPSNLLDFVPKLGNFVLNSSLHGNNSNGYSSFSSNSVHFGGLATQNRYKFVNSLSFSKEGSNLKRILSDFNRVIRLHCDRIPLGFSSIGLNSGESNGVSDNGHGVLEDVRVPVNAVEPESPKRVLILMSDTGGGHRASAEAIKAAFNEEFGDDYQVFVTDLWSEHTPWPFNQLPRSYNFLVKHGPLWKMMYYGTSPRVIHQSNFAATSVFIAREVARGLMKYQPDIIISVHPLMQHVPLRILRGRGLLEKIVFTTVVTDLSTCHPTWFHKLVTRCYCPSNEVAKRATKAGLQPSQIKVYGLPVRPSFVRSVRPKNELRKELGMDEHLPAVLLMGGGEGMGPIEATARALGNALYDANLGEPTGQLLVICGRNKKLAGKLSSIDWKIPVQVKGFVTKIEECMGACDCIITKAGPGTIAEAMIRGLPIILNDYIAGQEAGNVPYVIENGIGKYLKSPKEIAKTVSQWFGPKANELQIMSQNALKHARPDAVFKIVHDLDELVRQKIFVRQYSCAA		Q9SM44			6	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10419829	Penicillin-binding protein 2a of Streptococcus pneumoniae: expression in Escherichia coli and purification and refolding of inclusion bodies into a soluble and enzymatically active enzyme.	Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), targets of beta-lactam antibiotics, are membrane-bound enzymes essential for the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall. PBPs possess transpeptidase and transglycosylase activities responsible for the final steps of the bacterial cell wall cross-linking and polymerization, respectively. To facilitate our structural studies of PBPs, we constructed a 5&#39;-truncated version (lacking bp from 1 to 231 encoding the N-terminal part of the protein including the transmembrane domain) of the pbp2a gene of Streptococcus pneumoniae and expressed the truncated gene product as a GST fusion protein in Escherichia coli. This GST fusion form of PBP2a, designated GST-PBP2a*, was expressed almost exclusively as inclusion bodies. Using a combination of high- and low-speed centrifugation, large amounts of purified inclusion bodies were obtained. These purified inclusion bodies were refolded into a soluble and enzymatically active enzyme using a single-step refolding method consisting of solubilization of the inclusion bodies with urea and direct dialysis of the solubilized preparations. Using these purification and refolding methods, approximately 37 mg of soluble GST-PBP2a* protein was obtained from 1 liter of culture. The identity of this refolded PBP2a* protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The refolded PBP2a*, with or without the GST-tag, was found to bind to BOCILLIN FL, a beta-lactam, and to hydrolyze S2d, an analog of the bacterial cell wall stem peptides. The S2d hydrolysis activity of PBP2a* was inhibited by penicillin G. In conclusion, using this expression system, and the purification and refolding methods, large amounts of the soluble GST-PBP2a* protein were obtained and shown to be enzymatically active.	1999 Jul	Zhao G,Meier T I,Hoskins J,Jaskunas S R	Protein expression and purification. 16(2) 331-9	Penicillin-Binding Protein 2a	MRKFNSHSIPIRLNLLFSIVILLFMTIIGRLLYMQVLNKDFYEKKLASASQTKITSSSARGEIYDASGKPLVENTLKQVVSFTRSNKMTATDLKETAKKLLTYVSISSPNLTERQLADYYLADPEIYKKIVEALPSEKRLDSDGNRLSESELYNNAVDSVQTSQLNYTEDEKKEIYLFSQLNAVGNFATGTIATDPLNDSQVAVIASISKEMPGISISTSWDRKVLETSLSSIVGSVSSEKAGLPAEEAEAYLKKGYSLNDRVGTSYLEKQYEETLQGKRSVKEIHLDKYGNMESVDTIEEGSKGNNIKLTIDLAFQDSVDALLKSYFNSELENGGAKYSEGVYAVALNPKTGAVLSMSGIKHDLKTGELTPDSLGTVTNVFVPGSVVKAATISSGWENGVLSGNQTLTDQSIVFQGSAPINSWYTQAYGSFPITAVQALEYSSNTYMVQTALGLMGQTYQPNMFVGTSNLESAMEKLRSTFGEYGLGTATGIDLPDESTGFVPKEYSFANYITNAFGQFDNYTPMQLAQYVATIANNGVRVAPRIVEGIYGNNDKGGLGDLIQQLQPTEMNKVNISDSDMSILHQGFYQVAHGTSGLTTGRAFSNGALVSISGKTGTAESYVADGQQATNTNAVAYAPSDNPQIAVAVVFPHNTNLTNGVGPSIARDIINLYQKYHPMN	N-terminal GST	P0A3M5			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11485576	Matrix-assisted in vitro refolding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa class II polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase from inclusion bodies produced in recombinant Escherichia coli.	In order to facilitate the large-scale preparation of active class II polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase, we constructed a vector pT7-7 derivative that contains a modified phaC1 gene encoding a PHA synthase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa possessing six N-terminally fused histidine residues. Overexpression of this phaC1 gene under control of the strong Ø10 promoter was achieved in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The fusion protein was deposited as inactive inclusion bodies in recombinant E. coli, and contributed approx. 300f total protein. The inclusion bodies were purified by selective solubilization, resulting in approx. 70-80d0c850ure PHA synthase, then dissolved and denatured by 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The denatured PHA synthase was reversibly immobilized on a Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetate-agarose matrix. The matrix-bound fusion protein was refolded by gradual removal of the chaotropic reagent. This procedure avoided the aggregation of folding intermediates which often decreases the efficiency of refolding experiments. Finally, the refolded fusion protein was eluted with imidazole. The purified and refolded PHA synthase protein showed a specific enzyme activity of 10.8 m-units/mg employing (R/S)-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA as substrate, which corresponds to 270f the maximum specific activity of the native enzyme. The refolding of the enzyme was confirmed by CD spectroscopy. Deconvolution of the spectrum resulted in the following secondary structure prediction: 10% alpha-helix, 500eta-sheet and 40% random coil. Gel filtration chromatography indicated an apparent molecular mass of 69 kDa for the refolded PHA synthase. However, light-scattering analysis of a 10-fold concentrated sample indicated a molecular mass of 128 kDa. These data suggest that the class II PHA synthase is present in an equilibrium of monomer and dimer.	2001 Aug	Rehm B H,Qi Q,Beermann B B,Hinz H J,Steinbüchel A	The Biochemical journal. 358(Pt 1) 263-8	Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase	MATEEQSPGSGRDAQFERLNANLTRIDELSKRLTAALTKRKLSDPALHGPSSDVFLKAMTAYMAEMMQNPAKILEHQISFWGKSLKHYVEAQHQLVKGELKPPPDVTPKDRRFSNPLWQTHPFFNYLKQQYLMNAEAVNQAVEALEHIEPSDKKRVEYFSRQIVDLFSPTNFFGTNPDALERAIATDGESLVQGLENLVRDIEANKGDLLVTLADPEAFQVGQNLATTEGSVVYRNRMFELIQYKPTTETVHETPLLIFPPWINKFYILDLKPQNSLLKWLVDQGFTVFVVSWVNPDKSYAGIGMDDYIRDGYMRAMAEVRAITRQKQINAVGYCIAGTTLTLTLAHLQKAGDPSVRSATFFTTLTDFSDPGEVGVFLNDDFVDGIERQVAVDGILDKTFMSRTFSYLRSNDLIYQPAIKSYMMGEAPPAFDLLYWNGDGTNLPAQMAVEYLRGLCQQDRLAGGTFPVLGSPVGLKDVTLPVCAIACETDHIAPWKSSFNGFRQFGSTDKTFILSESGHVAGIVNPPSRNKYGHYTNEGPLDTPAAFREGAEFHAGSWWPRWGAWLAERSGKQVPARQPGDSKHPELAPAPGSYVAAPGGAEVAKPAAR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O05334			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2514121	Synthesis and refolding of human tissue-type plasminogen activator in Bacillus subtilis.	A 1.6 kb cDNA fragment encoding the mature part of the human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was subcloned into a Bacillus subtilis dual plasmid expression system [Le Grice et al., Gene 55 (1987) 95-103]. Expression of the tPA gene in this vector was regulated by the inducible Escherichia coli lac elements, as well as a strong phage-T5-derived promoter and ribosome-binding site preceding the polylinker. The 5&#39; end of the tPA gene corresponding to the N terminus of mature t-PA was fused in phase to the third codon present in the polylinker region of the expression vector, p602/22, to form p602-t-PA. B. subtilis containing p602-t-PA, when induced with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, produced large amounts of immunoreactive t-PA (approx. 20 micrograms/ml). As expected, t-PA was not secreted into the culture media, but was localized in intracellular inclusion bodies and was found to be enzymatically inactive. However, enzymatic activity could be regained following complete reduction followed by slow oxidation of the solubilized inclusion bodies. The recombinant t-PA (rt-PA) showed, after purification, a smaller molecular size than melanoma t-PA, probably due to lack of glycosylation in the Bacillus system. Like melanoma t-PA, rt-PA exhibited tremendous stimulation of plasminogen activation in the presence of fibrin. Our results illustrate that B. subtilis, when supplied with the proper transcriptional/translational regulatory elements, can be an effective system for expression of heterologous gene products.	1989 Dec	Wang L F,Hum W T,Kalyan N K,Lee S G,Hung P P,Doi R H	Gene. 84(1) 127-33	Tissue-type plasminogen activator	MDAMKRGLCCVLLLCGAVFVSPSQEIHARFRRGARSYQVICRDEKTQMIYQQHQSWLRPVLRSNRVEYCWCNSGRAQCHSVPVKSCSEPRCFNGGTCQQALYFSDFVCQCPEGFAGKCCEIDTRATCYEDQGISYRGTWSTAESGAECTNWNSSALAQKPYSGRRPDAIRLGLGNHNYCRNPDRDSKPWCYVFKAGKYSSEFCSTPACSEGNSDCYFGNGSAYRGTHSLTESGASCLPWNSMILIGKVYTAQNPSAQALGLGKHNYCRNPDGDAKPWCHVLKNRRLTWEYCDVPSCSTCGLRQYSQPQFRIKGGLFADIASHPWQAAIFAKHRRSPGERFLCGGILISSCWILSAAHCFQERFPPHHLTVILGRTYRVVPGEEEQKFEVEKYIVHKEFDDDTYDNDIALLQLKSDSSRCAQESSVVRTVCLPPADLQLPDWTECELSGYGKHEALSPFYSERLKEAHVRLYPSSRCTSQHLLNRTVTDNMLCAGDTRSGGPQANLHDACQGDSGGPLVCLNDGRMTLVGIISWGLGCGQKDVPGVYTKVTNYLDWIRDNMRP		P00750			9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1730025	Renaturation of cobra venom phospholipase A2 expressed from a synthetic gene in Escherichia coli.	Cobra venom (Naja naja naja) phospholipase A2 (PLA2) contains 14 cysteines in the form of 7 disulfide bonds amongst its 119 amino acids. A gene encoding the PLA2 was synthesized and inserted into a bacterial expression vector containing the phage lambda pL promoter. In order to obtain protein without the initiating methionine at the N-terminus, a Factor Xa site was engineered upstream from the PLA2 gene. Upon heat-induction of the cells transformed with the expression plasmid, the protein is produced as insoluble inclusion bodies. The enzyme was partially purified by washing the inclusion bodies with Triton X-100 and urea. The expressed protein was first denatured with 8 M guanidine-HCl and 10 mM DTT. After digestion with Factor Xa, formation of disulfide bonds and refolding into the fully active form was carried out in the presence of cysteine and Ca2+. The renatured recombinant protein was purified by Affi-gel blue column chromatography. The purified recombinant enzyme had the same specific activity as the native enzyme when assayed on a variety of substrates and cross-reacted with antisera prepared against the native enzyme. This is the first report of the expression of a recombinant PLA2 from any venom.	1992 Jan	Kelley M J,Crowl R M,Dennis E A	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1118(2) 107-15	Phospholipase A2	NLYQFKNMIKCTVPSRSWWDFADYGCYCGRGGSGTPVDDLDRCCQVHDNCYNEAEKISGCWPYFKTYSYECSQGTLTCKGDNNACAASVCDCDRLAAICFAGAPYNDNNYNIDLKARCQ		P15445			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1847867	Efficient renaturation and fibrinolytic properties of prourokinase and a deletion mutant expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies.	Prourokinase is a plasminogen activator of 411 amino acids which displays a clot-lysis activity through a fibrin-dependent mechanism, and which seems to be a promising agent for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. The preparation of recombinant prourokinase in bacteria has been hampered by its insolubility and by difficulty in refolding the polypeptide chain. In this paper we describe the renaturation process of two recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies: prourokinase and a deletion derivative (delta 125-prourokinase) in which 125 amino acids of the N-terminal region have been removed. Deletion of this sequence brings to higher refolding yields and faster kinetics (first-order rate constant of renaturation of 0.57 h-1 for delta 125-prourokinase and 0.25 h-1 for prourokinase). Our process involves sequential steps of denaturation, reduction and controlled refolding of the polypeptide chain. When applied to pure, non-glycosylated and active prourokinase, it gives a refolding yield of about 80%, demonstrating the efficiency of the renaturation procedure. Lower yields (15% and 30%, respectively, for prourokinase and delta 125-prourokinase) were obtained when the same refolding protocol was applied to inclusion bodies from bacteria. After purification to homogeneity (as shown by HPLC and SDS/PAGE) specific activities were 160,000 and 250,000 IU/mg protein, respectively, for prourokinase and delta 125-prourokinase. As with prourokinase, the deletion mutant delta 125-prourokinase displays a zymogenic nature, being activated by plasmin to the active two-chain form; however, this mutant is approximately fourfold more resistant than prourokinase to plasmin activation, and consequently shows a different fibrinolytic profile.	1991 Feb	Orsini G,Brandazza A,Sarmientos P,Molinari A,Lansen J,Cauet G	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 195(3) 691-7	Urokinase-type plasminogen activator	MRALLARLLLCVLVVSDSKGSNELHQVPSNCDCLNGGTCVSNKYFSNIHWCNCPKKFGGQHCEIDKSKTCYEGNGHFYRGKASTDTMGRPCLPWNSATVLQQTYHAHRSDALQLGLGKHNYCRNPDNRRRPWCYVQVGLKPLVQECMVHDCADGKKPSSPPEELKFQCGQKTLRPRFKIIGGEFTTIENQPWFAAIYRRHRGGSVTYVCGGSLMSPCWVISATHCFIDYPKKEDYIVYLGRSRLNSNTQGEMKFEVENLILHKDYSADTLAHHNDIALLKIRSKEGRCAQPSRTIQTICLPSMYNDPQFGTSCEITGFGKENSTDYLYPEQLKMTVVKLISHRECQQPHYYGSEVTTKMLCAADPQWKTDSCQGDSGGPLVCSLQGRMTLTGIVSWGRGCALKDKPGVYTRVSHFLPWIRSHTKEENGLAL		P00749			7.6	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1368892	Heterologous expression of thermopsin, a heat-stable acid proteinase.	We have previously reported the isolation, characterization, and gene sequence of a new thermostable acid protease, thermopsin, from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, a thermophilic archaebacterium. Thermopsin is similar to aspartic protease pepsin in specificity and pH dependence. However, it optimally catalyzes in the temperature range of 85 to 90 degrees C and it is not structurally related to pepsin. The current report describes the synthesis of recombinant thermopsin in E. coli and in insect cells. Several recombinant thermopsin fusion proteins were expressed as &quot;inclusion bodies&quot; in the cytosol of E. coli. Active thermopsin preparations were obtained by refolding from urea solutions. Recombinant thermopsin was also expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. The thermostability of recombinant thermopsin is similar to that of the native enzyme.	1992 Sep	Lin X,Liu M,Tang J	Enzyme and microbial technology. 14(9) 696-701	Thermopsin	MNFKSICLIILLSALIIPYIPQNIYFFPHRNTTGATISSGLYVNPYLYYTSPPAPAGIASFGLYNYSGNVTPYVITTNEMLGYVNITSLLAYNREALRYGVDPYSATLQFNIVLSVNTSNGVYAYWLQDVGQFQTNKNSLTFIDNVWNLTGSLSTLSSSAITGNGQVASAGGGQTFYYDVGPSYTYSFPLSYIYIINMSYTSNAVYVWIGYEIIQIGQTEYGTVNYYDKITIYQPNIISASLMINGNNYTPNGLYYDAELVWGGGGNGAPTSFNSLNCTLGLYYISNGSITPVPSLYTFGADTAEAAYNVYTTMNNGVPIAYNGIENLTILTNNFSVILI	N-terminal pepsinogen	P17118			9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11796171	Renaturation and purification of bone morphogenetic protein-2 produced as inclusion bodies in high-cell-density cultures of recombinant Escherichia coli.	Eschericha coli was genetically engineered to produce recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in a non-active aggregated form using a temperature-inducible expression system. High concentrations of both biomass (75 g cell dry weight per liter of culture broth) and inactive rhBMP-2 (8.6 gl(-1)) were obtained by applying a high-cell-density cultivation procedure. After washing and solubilizing the inclusion bodies, rhBMP-2 was refolded and dimerized at concentrations up to 100 mgl(-1) by means of a simple dilution method with yields exceeding 50%. Finally, a one-step purification procedure based on affinity chromatography was implemented to isolate the rhBMP-2 dimer. With the established renaturation and purification protocols, yields of more than 10 mg rhBMP-2 dimer per gram cell dry weight were obtained corresponding to 750 mg rhBMP-2 dimer per liter of culture broth. The purified rhBMP-2 dimer showed biological activity equivalent to CHO produced rhBMP-2 as tested by the induction of alkaline phosphatase activity in C2C12 cells.	2002 Mar	Vallejo Luis Felipe,Brokelmann Maren,Marten Sabine,Trappe Susanne,Cabrera-Crespo Joaquin,Hoffmann Andrea,Gross Gerhard,Weich Herbert A,Rinas Ursula	Journal of biotechnology. 94(2) 185-94	Bone morphogenetic protein-2	QAKHKQRKRLKSSCKRHPLYVDFSDVGWNDWIVAPPGYHAFYCHGECPFPLADHLNSTNHAIVQTLVNSVNSKIPKACCVPTELSAISMLYLDENEKVVLKNYQDMVVEGCGCR		P12643			8.5	20	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12119046	Cloning, sequencing and heterologous expression of the gene for lupanine hydroxylase, a quinocytochrome c from a Pseudomonas sp.	The gene encoding the enzyme lupanine hydroxylase was isolated by PCR using chromosomal DNA from a lupanine-utilizing Pseudomonas sp. as template and primers based on the sequences of the N- and C-termini of the purified protein. The derived sequence for the mature gene product gave a protein with an M (r) of 72256, in good agreement with the value found by SDS/PAGE of the pure enzyme, and contained the sequences of several peptides obtained after endoproteinase Lys-C digestion of the pure enzyme. The gene, under the transcriptional control of a phoA promotor and with the Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase signal sequence, was expressed in E. coli containing a plasmid expressing the genes for cytochrome c maturation proteins constitutively. Haem-containing inactive protein in inclusion bodies was renatured and reactivated with pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) and Ca(2+) to give active enzyme. The lupanine hydroxylase (luh) gene coded for a protein with a cleavable 26-residue signal sequence at its N-terminus, required for the transport of the enzyme to its periplasmic location. Analysis of the protein sequence showed that it contains two domains, a large PQQ-binding N-terminal domain and a smaller cytochrome c C-terminal domain. Comparison of the derived sequence with those of other proteins showed considerable similarity with other quino(haemo)proteins, including alcohol dehydrogenases from a variety of bacteria. The PQQ-binding domain sequence contains W motifs, characteristic of the eight-bladed &quot;propeller&quot; structure of methanol dehydrogenase, but lacks the unusual disulphide ring structure formed from two adjacent cysteines seen in this enzyme. The C-terminus shares some similarity with bacterial cytochrome c and includes the haem-binding consensus sequence CXXCH.	2002 Oct	Hopper David J,Kaderbhai Mustak A,Marriott Shirley A,Young Michael,Rogozinski Jerzy	The Biochemical journal. 367(Pt 2) 483-9	Lupanine hydroxylase	NEKDGSAVTSGNWSLLGGGNEQHYFSALKDVNKSNVKNLGLSWFTDMEAGDGLVGNPLVADGVIYQGGPPGKIYANDLKTGKNLWTYTPEVQYDKDTSWTGFWGTHVNRGLAVDDDNVYIGSYCKLLAVSRTTHKLTWSSQSCDPKKMQAITGAPRVGGGKVFIGNASGDFGGDRGHLDAFDAKTGKHLWRFYTMPGDPSKPFENDLLAKASKTWGTDYWKYTKGGVSPWDAITYDEASDTLYFGTDGPSPWSPAQRAPDAGDELFSHSIIAVDASTGAYKWHFQTVQNDGSNMSATMHIMLADLPVEGVSKRVVMTAPKNGYFYVLDASTGKFISADHYVPVNWTKGLDPKTGRPIPSNEANYWERPGEMTIPLPGDVGGHNWEAMAYNPELRTVYIPSTLVPVTVVASKDTGELDLDYYYGMRPDATIKTQGDLVAWDPLLQKEKWRAKRSLPVNGGVLATAGGLVFQGTGDGHFEAFDANTGEKLWSFHVGGSILAAPTTVEVDGDQYLIVASGNGGASGMRGIPRLMNNLQSQGPARLLAFRLGGKTELPITSTPDFPKPQYPKPTSAMAESGRHIFNANACGACHGFNAEGSTPGLPDLRRSDKLDLAVMKSIVIDGAFKPLGMPGHPHISDADLQALQAFILQKAWTAYDTQQTLKTSDTGAQ		Q934G0			8	20	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11577113	Cloning, sequencing, heterologous expression, purification, and characterization of adenosylcobalamin-dependent D-ornithine aminomutase from Clostridium sticklandii.	D-Ornithine aminomutase from Clostridium sticklandii catalyzes the reversible rearrangement of d-ornithine to (2R,4S)-2,4-diaminopentanoic acid. The two genes encoding d-ornithine aminomutase have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The oraS gene, which encodes a protein of 121 amino acid residues with M(r) 12,800, is situated upstream of the oraE gene, which encodes a protein of 753 amino acid residues with M(r) 82,900. The holoenzyme appears to comprise a alpha(2)beta(2)-heterotetramer. OraS shows no significant homology to other proteins in the Swiss-Prot data base. The deduced amino acid sequence of OraE includes a conserved base-off/histidine-on cobalamin-binding motif, DXHXXG. OraE was expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies. Refolding experiments on OraE indicate that the interactions between OraS and OraE and the binding of either pyridoxal phosphate or adenosylcobalamin play important roles in refolding process. The K(m) values for d-ornithine, 5&#39;-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl), and pyridoxal 5&#39;-phosphate (PLP) are 44.5 +/- 2.8, 0.43 +/- 0.04, and 1.5 +/- 0.1 microm, respectively; the k(cat) is 6.3 +/- 0.1 s(-1). The reaction was absolutely dependent upon OraE, OraS, AdoCbl, PLP, and D-ornithine being present in the assay; no other cofactors were required. A red-shift in UV-visible absorption spectrum is observed when free adenosylcobinamide is bound by recombinant D-ornithine aminomutase and no significant change in spectrum when free adenosylcobinamide is bound by mutant OraE-H618G, demonstrating that the enzyme binds adenosylcobalamin in base-off/histidine-on mode.	2001 Nov	Chen H P,Wu S H,Lin Y L,Chen C M,Tsay S S	The Journal of biological chemistry. 276(48) 44744-50	D-ornithine aminomutase E component	MEKDLQLRVNEKLDVENILKDLDKYTPKRRGWTWRQPAENLQMGPFIYKDASTPLENSVALPSAKYFGDIDPQPLPVITTEIASGRFEDDIRRMRMAAWHGADHIMVIRTAGQSHYDGLIEGTPQGIGGVPITRKQVRAQRKALDLIEEEVGRPINYHSYVSGVAGPDIAVMFAEEGVNGAHQDPQYNVLYRNINMIRSFIDACESKTIMAWADMAQIDGIDGAHNANATAREAWKVMPELMVQHALNSIFSLKVGMKKSNICLSTVPPTAPPAPSMYLDLPYAVALREMFEGYRMRAQMNTKYMEASTREATVTHVLNLLISKLTRADIQSTITPDEGRNVPWHIYNIEACDTAKQALIGMDGLMDMVQLKREGVLGDTVRELKERAVLFMEEIIEAGGYFNAVEQGFFVDSGYYPERNGDGIARQINGGIGAGTVFERDEDYMAPVTAHFGYNNVKQYDEALVSEPSKLIDGCTLEVPEKIVYIDELDENDNVNVRMEETKEFRHSSMIKPEVEWQADGTVLLTMFLPTSKRVAEFAAIEFAKKMNLEEVEVINREVMQEAEGTRIELKGRVPFSIDINSLVIPPEPEILSEDEIREDIEKTPLKIVAATVGEDEHSVGLREVIDIKHGGIEKYGVEVHYLGTSVPVEKLVDAAIELKADAILASTIISHDDIHYKNMKRIHELAVEKGIRDKIMIGCGGTQVTPEVAVKQGVDAGFGRGSKGIHVATFLVKKRREMREGK		Q8VPJ5			7	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

A major cysteine proteinase (CPB) of Leishmania mexicana, that is predominantly expressed in the form of the parasite that causes disease in mammals, has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies to apparent homogeneity. The CPB enzyme, CPB2.8, was expressed as an inactive pro-form lacking the characteristic C-terminal extension (CPB2.8DeltaCTE). Pro-region processing was initiated during protein refolding and proceeded through several intermediate stages. Maximum enzyme activity accompanied removal of the entire pro-region. This was facilitated by acidification. Purified mature enzyme gave a single band on SDS/PAGE and gelatin SDS/PAGE gels, co-migrated with native enzyme in L. mexicana lysates, and had the same N-terminal sequence as the native enzyme. The procedure yielded &gt;3.5 mg of active enzyme per litre of E. coli culture.	2000 Apr	Sanderson S J,Pollock K G,Hilley J D,Meldal M,Hilaire P S,Juliano M A,Juliano L,Mottram J C,Coombs G H	The Biochemical journal. 347(Pt 2) 383-8	Cysteine proteinase B	HHHHHHHMATSRAALCAVAVVCVVLAAACAPARAIHVGTPAAALFEEFKRTYGRAYETLAEEQQRLANFERNLELMREHQARNPHAQFGITKFFDLSEAEFAARYLNGAAYFAAAKRHAAQHYRKARADLSAVPDAVDWREKGAVTPVKDQGACGSCWAFSAVGNIEGQWYLAGHELVSLSEQQLVSCDDMNDGCDGGLMLQAFDWLLQNTNGHLHTEDSYPYVSGNGYVPECSNSSELVVGAQIDGHVLIGSSEKAMAAWLAKNGPIAIALDASSFMSYKSGVLTACIGKQLNHGVLLVGYDMTGEVPYWVIKNSWGGDWGEQGYVRVVMGVNACLLSEYPVSAHVRESAAPGTSTSSETPAPRPVMVEQVICFDKNCTQGCRKTLIKANECHKNGGGGASMIKCSPQKVTMCTYSNEFCVGGGLCFETPDGKCAPYFLGSIMNTCHYT	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P36400			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11570853	Overexpression, refolding, and purification of the histidine-tagged outer membrane efflux protein OprM of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	This paper describes the overproduction and purification of the C-terminus polyhistidine-tagged outer membrane protein OprM, which is a part of the MexA-MexB-OprM active efflux system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Renaturation of the protein from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli was achieved using guanidine-HCl as denaturing agent and n-octylpolyoxyethylene (C8POE) and n-octyltetraoxyethylene (C8E4) as nonionic detergents. The refolded protein was purified by ion-exchange and nickel-affinity chromatography. The final yield was 6 mg of pure histidine-tagged OprM per liter of E. coli culture. Renaturation was monitored by the effects of heating prior to SDS-PAGE, using a typical and exclusive property of outer membrane proteins. Immunoblotting revealed that the recombinant protein is addressed to the outer membrane of E. coli, after maturation by excision of its N-terminal signal sequence. Complementation of an oprM deletion mutant with the plasmid encoded histidine-tagged OprM protein restored antibiotic susceptibilities to wild-type levels, demonstrating functionality of recombinant OprM.	2001 Oct	Charbonnier F,Köhler T,Pechère J C,Ducruix A	Protein expression and purification. 23(1) 121-7	Outer membrane protein OprM	MKRSFLSLAVAAVVLSGCSLIPDYQRPEAPVAAAYPQGQAYGQNTGAAAVPAADIGWREFFRDPQLQQLIGVALENNRDLRVAALNVEAFRAQYRIQRADLFPRIGVDGSGTRQRLPGDLSTTGSPAISSQYGVTLGTTAWELDLFGRLRSLRDQALEQYLATEQAQRSAQTTLVASVATAYLTLKADQAQLQLTKDTLGTYQKSFDLTQRSYDVGVASALDLRQAQTAVEGARATLAQYTRLVAQDQNALVLLLGSGIPANLPQGLGLDQTLLTEVPAGLPSDLLQRRPDILEAEHQLMAANASIGAARAAFFPSISLTANAGTMSRQLSGLFDAGSGSWLFQPSINLPIFTAGSLRASLDYAKIQKDINVAQYEKAIQTAFQEVADGLAARGTFTEQLQAQRDLVKASDEYYQLADKRYRTGVDNYLTLLDAQRSLFTAQQQLITDRLNQLTSEVNLYKALGGGWNQQTVTQQQTAKKEDPQA	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q51487			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14711522	Purification and refolding of a novel cancer/testis antigen BJ-HCC-2 expressed in the inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli.	BJ-HCC-2 is one of the cancer/testis antigens that may be the most promising targets for tumor immunotherapy. To investigate the expression of BJ-HCC-2 protein in tumor cells and its capacity to elicit CTL response, the recombinant protein of BJ-HCC-2 was expressed in the inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The inclusion bodies were solubilized effectively with 0.3% N-lauroyl sarcosine in alkaline buffer. Under this denatured form, the BJ-HCC-2 protein carrying 6x histidine tag was purified with Ni-NTA affinity chromatography in a single step with a purity of over 97%. The yield of the purified protein was about 78%. The purified recombinant protein was refolded in a simple way. The correct refolding of the recombinant protein was verified in the recovery of its secondary and tertiary structures as assessed by circular dichroism and fluorescence emission spectra. The recovery rate of refolded protein was 92.1%. The renatured protein displayed its immunoreactivity with the antibodies to BJ-HCC-2 protein by Western blotting. This method of protein purification and refolding is easy to manipulate and may be applicable to the hydrophobic proteins that are unable to be purified by other methods.	2004 Feb	Yang Xiao Ang,Dong Xue Yuan,Li Yan,Wang Yue Dan,Chen Wei Feng	Protein expression and purification. 33(2) 332-8	Testis expressed transcript protein	MAGGPPNTKAEMEMSLAEELNHGRQGENQEHLVIAEMMELGSRSRGASQKKQKLEQKAAGSASAKRVWNMTATRPKKMGSQLPKPRMLRESGHGDAHLQEYAGNFQGIRFHYDRNPGTDAVAQTSLEEFNVLEMEVMRRQLYAVNRRLRALEEQGATWRHRETLIIAVLVSASIANLWLWMNQ		Q969F0			8	37	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

10889036	Human apolipoprotein C-II forms twisted amyloid ribbons and closed loops.	Human apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II) self-associates in solution to form aggregates with the characteristics of amyloid including red-green birefringence in the presence of Congo Red under cross-polarized light, increased fluorescence in the presence of thioflavin T, and a fibrous structure when examined by electron microscopy. ApoC-II was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli and rapidly exchanged from 5 M guanidine hydrochloride into 100 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 0.3 mg/mL. This apoC-II was initially soluble, eluting as low molecular weight species in gel filtration experiments using Sephadex G-50. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicated predominantly unordered structure. Upon incubation for 24 h, apoC-II self-associated into high molecular weight aggregates as indicated by elution in the void volume of a Sephadex G-50 column, by rapid sedimentation in an analytical ultracentrifuge, and by increased light scattering. CD spectroscopy indicated an increase in beta-sheet content, while fluorescence emission spectroscopy of the single tryptophan revealed a blue shift and an increase in maximum intensity, suggesting repositioning of the tryptophan into a less polar environment. Electron microscopy of apoC-II aggregates revealed a novel looped-ribbon morphology (width 12 nm) and several isolated closed loops. Like all of the conserved plasma apolipoproteins, apoC-II contains amphipathic helical regions that account for the increase in alpha-helix content on lipid binding. The increase in beta-structure accompanying apoC-II fibril formation points to an alternative folding pathway and an in vitro system to explore the general tendency of apolipoproteins to form amyloid in vivo.	2000 Jul	Hatters D M,MacPhee C E,Lawrence L J,Sawyer W H,Howlett G J	Biochemistry. 39(28) 8276-83	Apolipoprotein C-II	MGTRLLPALFLVLLVLGFEVQGTQQPQQDEMPSPTFLTQVKESLSSYWESAKTAAQNLYEKTYLPAVDEKLRDLYSKSTAAMSTYTGIFTDQVLSVLKGEE		O95996			7.4	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
8626487	Folding of a mutant maltose-binding protein of Escherichia coli which forms inclusion bodies.	The maltose-binding protein (MalE) of Escherichia coli is the periplasmic component of the transport system for malto-oligosaccharides. We have examined the characteristics of a Mal- mutant of malE corresponding to the double substitution Gly32 --&gt; Asp/Ile33 --&gt; Pro, MalE31, previously obtained by random mutagenesis. In vivo, the MalE31 precursor is efficiently processed, but the mature protein forms inclusion bodies in the periplasm. Furthermore, the accumulation of insoluble MalE31 is independent of its cellular localization; MalE31 lacking its signal sequence forms inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm. The native MalE31 protein can be purified by affinity chromatography from inclusion bodies after denaturation by 8 M urea. The renatured protein exhibits full maltose binding affinity (Kd= 9 x 10(-7) M), suggesting that its folded structure is similar to that of the wild-type protein. Unfolding/refolding experiments show that MalE31 is less stable (-5. 5 kcal/mol) than the wild-type protein (-9.5 kcal/mol) and that folding intermediates have a high tendency to form aggregates. In conclusion, the observed phenotype of cells expressing malE31 can be explained by a defective folding pathway of the protein.	1996 Apr	Betton J M,Hofnung M	The Journal of biological chemistry. 271(14) 8046-52	Maltose-binding protein	MKIKTGARILALSALTTMMFSASALAKIEEGKLVIWINGDKGYNGLAEVGKKFEKDTGIKVTVEHPDKLEEKFPQVAATGDGPDIIFWAHDRFGGYAQSGLLAEITPDKAFQDKLYPFTWDAVRYNGKLIAYPIAVEALSLIYNKDLLPNPPKTWEEIPALDKELKAKGKSALMFNLQEPYFTWPLIAADGGYAFKYENGKYDIKDVGVDNAGAKAGLTFLVDLIKNKHMNADTDYSIAEAAFNKGETAMTINGPWAWSNIDTSKVNYGVTVLPTFKGQPSKPFVGVLSAGINAASPNKELAKEFLENYLLTDEGLEAVNKDKPLGAVALKSYEEELAKDPRIAATMENAQKGEIMPNIPQMSAFWYAVRTAVINAASGRQTVDEALKDAQTRITK		P0AEX9			7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10544284	Refolding and recovery of recombinant human matrix metalloproteinase 7 (matrilysin) from inclusion bodies expressed by Escherichia coli.	The recombinant prepro-form of human matrix metalloproteinase 7 (matrilysin or MMP-7) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies. The recombinant protein was refolded by 100-fold dilution after solubilization with 6 M guanidine HCl. The refolding was monitored by the recovery of matrilysin activity. The addition of either 1.0 M arginine or 0.10rij-35 promoted remarkably the refolding. The refolding was dependent on pH and temperature, with lower temperature (&lt;10 degrees C) and pH 6-8 preferable. Glutathione had no effect on refolding, and it was excluded from the refolding conditions. Starting with inclusion bodies (2.0 g, wet) containing 360 mg protein, 29.5 mg of pro-matrilysin (30 kDa) was obtained after refolding with 1.00rij-35 at pH 7.5 and 4 degrees C for 12 h. Pro-matrilysin (24.0 mg) was purified to homogeneity by cation-exchange HPLC with a 15-fold increase in purity and an activity yield of 81.3%. Pro-matrilysin was converted entirely to matrilysin (19.0 kDa; 15.2 mg) by activation with a mercuric reagent. The activity (k(cat)/K(m)) of matrilysin was 1.7 x 10(5) M(-1) x s(-1).	1999 Nov	Oneda H,Inouye K	Journal of biochemistry. 126(5) 905-11	Matrilysin	YSLFPNSPKWTSKVVTYRIVSYTRDLPHITVDRLVSKALNMWGKEIPLHFRKVVWGTADIMIGFARGAHGDSYPFDGPGNTLAHAFAPGTGLGGDAHFDEDERWTDGSSLGINFLYAATHELGHSLGMGHSSDPNAVMYPTYGNGDPQNFKLSQDDIKGIQKLYGKRSNSRKK		P09237			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8809030	In vivo and in vitro folding of a recombinant metalloenzyme, phosphomannose isomerase.	Phosphomannose isomerase (PMI) catalyses the interconversion of mannose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The enzyme is a metalloenzyme which contains 1 mol of zinc per mol of enzyme. Heterologous expression of the cDNA coding for the Candida albicans enzyme in the prokaryotic host Escherichia coli results in an expression level of up to 300f total E. coli protein. Ten percent of recombinant PMI is expressed in the soluble fraction and 90 0n inclusion bodies. Inclusion of a high level of zinc in the fermentation medium resulted in a fourfold increase in soluble protein. Co-expression of the bacterial chaperones, GroES and GroEL, resulted in a proportional twofold increase in soluble PMI while causing an overall decrease in the PMI expression level. Folding denatured PMI in vitro required reductant and zinc ions. The yield of renatured protein was increased by folding in the presence of GroEL and DnaK in an ATP-independent manner. The refolding yield of denatured soluble enzyme from a guanidine solution was threefold higher than that of folding monomerized inclusion body protein solubilized in guanidine hydrochloride. This suggests that a proportion of recombinant protein expressed in E.coli inclusion bodies may be irreversibly denatured.	1996 Sep	Proudfoot A E,Goffin L,Payton M A,Wells T N,Bernard A R	The Biochemical journal. 318 ( Pt 2) 437-42	Phosphomannose isomerase	SSEKLFRIQCGYQNYDWGKIGSSSAVAQFVHNSDPSITIDETKPYAELWMGTHPSVPSKAIDLNNQTLRDLVTAKPQEYLGESIITKFGSSKELPFLFKVLSIEKVLSIQAHPDKKLGAQLHAADPKNYPDDNHKPEMAIAVTDFEGFCGFKPLDQLAKTLATVPELNEIIGQELVDEFISGIKLPAEVGSQDDVNNRKLLQKVFGKLMNTDDDVIKQQTAKLLERTDREPQVFKDIDSRLPELIQRLNKQFPNDIGLFCGCLLLNHVGLNKGEAMFLQAKDPHAYISGDIIECMAASDNVVRAGFTPKFKDVKNLVEMLTYSYESVEKQKMPLQEFPRSKGDAVKSVLYDPPIAEFSVLQTIFDKSKGGKQVIEGLNGPSIVIATNGKGTIQITGDDSTKQKIDTGYVFFVAPGSSIELTADSANQDQDFTTYRAFVEA		P34948			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9860845	Two stable unfolding intermediates of the disease-causing L68Q variant of human cystatin C.	In hereditary cystatin C amyloid angiopathy (HCCAA), presence of the Leu68 --&gt; Gln substitution in cystatin C is coupled to a decreased concentration of this major cysteine proteinase inhibitor in cerebrospinal fluid and leads to its amyloid deposition in the brain. We established a high-yield expression system for L68Q cystatin C in Escherichia coli resulting in inclusion body accumulation at a level of 400f the total cellular protein. Refolding of protein from purified inclusion bodies yielded a pure, almost completely monomeric and active inhibitor. CD and NMR spectroscopy demonstrated that so produced L68Q cystatin C is folded, conformationally homogeneous, and structurally very similar to wild-type cystatin C. Incubation at pH 7.0-5.5 caused the cystatin C variant to dimerize rapidly. The molecular form present at pH 6.0 displayed a slightly increased amount of hydrophobic parts on the surface as measured by 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS) binding. NMR results showed that the dimer has a structure similar to that of the wild-type cystatin C dimer formed as a result of slight denaturation. Under more acidic conditions, at pH 4.5, another stable unfolding intermediate of L68Q cystatin C was identified. This molecular form exists in a monomeric state, is characterized by changes in secondary structure according to far UV CD spectroscopy, and shows an altered ANS binding resembling that of a molten globule state. The acidic pH also caused an almost complete monomerization of preformed dimers. The state of denaturation of L68Q cystatin C in vivo is thus a critical factor for the concentration of active cysteine proteinase inhibitor in cerebrospinal fluid and likely also for the development of amyloidosis, in HCCAA patients.	1998 Dec	Gerhartz B,Ekiel I,Abrahamson M	Biochemistry. 37(49) 17309-17	Cystatin C	SSPGKPPRLVGGPMDASVEEEGVRRALDFAVGEYNKASNDMYHSRALQVVRARKQIVAGVNYFLDVELGRTTCTKTQPNLDNCPFHDQPHLKRKAFCSFQIYAVPWQGTMTLSKSTCQDA		P01034			7.8	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
12491527	Bioimmobilization of keratinase using Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli systems.	Immobilized keratinase can improve stability while retaining its proteolytic and keratinolytic properties. Conventional purification followed by chemical immobilization is a laborious and costly process. A new genetic construct was developed to produce the keratinase-streptavidin fusion protein. Consequently, the purification and immobilization of the fusion protein onto a biotinylated matrix can be accomplished in a single step. The method was tested in both the Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli systems. In B. subtilis, the fusion protein was produced extracellularly and readily immobilized from the medium. In E. coli, the fusion protein was produced intracellularly in inclusion bodies; additional separation and renaturation processes were required prior to immobilization from the cell extract. The overall efficiencies were approximately the same, 24-28%, using both systems.	2003 Feb	Wang Jeng-Jie,Swaisgood Harold E,Shih Jason C H	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 81(4) 421-9	Keratinase	AQPAKNVEKDYIVGFKSGVKTASVKKDIIKESGGKVDKQFRIINAAKAKLDKEALKEVKNDPDVAYVEEDHVAHALAQTVPYGIPLIKADKVQAQGFKGANVKVAVLDTGIQASHPDLNVVGGASFVAGEAYNTDGNGHGTHVAGTVAALDNTTGVLGVAPSVSLYAVKVLNSSGSGSYSGIVSGIEWATTNGMDVINMSLGGASGSTAMKQAVDNAYARGVVVVAAAGNSGSSGNTNTIGYPAKYDSVIAVGAVDSNSNRASFSSVGAELEVMAPGAGVYSTYPTNTYATLNGTSMVSPHVAGAAALILSKHPNLSASQVRNRLSSTATYLGSSFYYGKGLINVEAAAQDPSKDSKAQVSAAEAGITGTWYNQLGSTFIVTAGADGALTGTYESAVGNAESRYVLTGRYDSAPATDGSGTALGWTVAWKNNYRNAHSATTWSGQYVGGAEARINTQWLLTSGTTEANAWKSTLVGHDTFTKVKPSAASIDAAKKAGVNNGNPLDAVQQ	approximated sequence only. streptavidin sequence based on UniProt SAV_STRAVA range of other constructs with or without the Pre and Pro regions of keratinase also produced	Q53521			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
10545273	Matrix-assisted refolding of single-chain Fv- cellulose binding domain fusion proteins.	We describe a method for the isolation of recombinant single-chain antibodies in a biologically active form. The single-chain antibodies are fused to a cellulose binding domain as a single-chain protein that accumulates as insoluble inclusion bodies upon expression in Escherichia coli. The inclusion bodies are then solubilized and denatured by an appropriate chaotropic solvent, then reversibly immobilized onto a cellulose matrix via specific interaction of the matrix with the cellulose binding domain (CBD) moiety. The efficient immobilization that minimizes the contact between folding protein molecules, thus preventing their aggregation, is facilitated by the robustness of the Clostridium thermocellum CBD we use. This CBD is unique in retaining its specific cellulose binding capability when solubilized in up to 6 M urea, while the proteins fused to it are fully denatured. Refolding of the fusion proteins is induced by reducing with time the concentration of the denaturing solvent while in contact with the cellulose matrix. The refolded single-chain antibodies in their native state are then recovered by releasing them from the cellulose matrix in high yield of 600r better, which is threefold or higher than the yield obtained by using published refolding protocols to recover the same scFvs. The described method should have general applicability for the production of many protein-CBD fusions in which the fusion partner is insoluble upon expression.	1999 Nov	Berdichevsky Y,Lamed R,Frenkel D,Gophna U,Bayer E A,Yaron S,Shoham Y,Benhar I	Protein expression and purification. 17(2) 249-59	Single Chain Fv	EVQLVESGGGVVRPGGSLRISCAASGFTFDDYGMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVSGINWNGGSTGYADSVKGRFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCARRRYALDYWGQGTLV		Q9HCC1			9.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15041214	Development of a biotin mimic tagged ScFv antibody against western equine encephalitis virus: bacterial expression and refolding.	Single chain antibodies (ScFvs) are heavy and light chain variable domains connected by an artificial linker. Because of their smaller size, ScFvs show improved tissue penetration in vivo and reduced immunogenicity, making them ideal for therapeutic applications. We have cloned a ScFv against western equine encephalitis (WEE) using rDNA technology. The ScFv was generated from a hybridoma cell line (11D2) specific to the WEE virus E1 glycoprotein and is arranged in the V(L)-V(H) orientation with a (gly(4)ser)(3) linker. This ScFv was engineered successfully with a biotin mimic tag (11 amino acid peptide) and cloned in the pET22b+ expression vector. The ScFv was expressed as a approximately 32kDa protein in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, with an estimated yield of 20-40 mg/l. Different refolding protocols were used to solubilise the inclusion bodies. Most of the functional ScFv was generated when the inclusion bodies were solubilized in a detergent, air oxidised in the presence of CuSO(4) and then denatured in urea buffer in comparison to other protocols. The product was renatured finally in Tris arginine buffer (pH 8.0). Refolded protein was dialysed against phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (pH 7.3) to remove the Tris and arginine. Our refolding protocol generated up to a 50% yield of soluble protein, which retained antigen-binding activity with whole inactivated WEE virus as demonstrated by ELISA and Western blot analysis. This 11D2-biotin mimic ScFv complexed with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (St-HRPO) will be useful as a detector reagent in the ultrasensitive ELISA detection of WEE virus antigen.	2004 May	Das D,Kriangkum J,Nagata L P,Fulton R E,Suresh M R	Journal of virological methods. 117(2) 169-77	Single Chain Fv	EVQLVESGGGVVRPGGSLRISCAASGFTFDDYGMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVSGINWNGGSTGYADSVKGRFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCARRRYALDYWGQGTLV		Q9HCC1			7.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12519771	How additives influence the refolding of immunoglobulin-folded proteins in a stepwise dialysis system. Spectroscopic evidence for highly efficient refolding of a single-chain Fv fragment.	The gradual removal of the denaturing reagent guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) using stepwise dialysis with the introduction of an oxidizing reagent and l-arginine resulted in the highly efficient refolding of various denatured single-chain Fv fragments (scFvs) from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli. In this study, the influence of the additives on the intermediates in scFv refolding was carefully analyzed on the basis of the stepwise dialysis, and it was revealed that the additive effect critically changes the pathway of scFv refolding. Circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence emission spectroscopies demonstrated that distinct secondary and tertiary structures were formed upon dialysis from 2 m GdnHCl to 1 m GdnHCl, and 4,4&#39;-dianilino-1,1&#39;-binaphthyl-5,5&#39;-disulfonic acid dipotassium salt binding analysis indicated that the addition of l-arginine to the stepwise dialysis system effectively stabilized the exposed hydrophobic area on the scFv. Quantification of the free thiol groups in the scFv by means of Ellman&#39;s assay revealed that there was a particular stage in which most of the free thiol groups were oxidized and that adding an oxidizing reagent (the oxidized form of glutathione, GSSG) at that stage was important for complete refolding of the scFv. The particular stage depended on the nature of the refolding solution, especially on whether l-arginine was present. Spontaneous folding at the 1 m GdnHCl stage resulted in a structure in which a free thiol group accessed to the proper one for correct disulfide linkage; however, the addition of l-arginine resulted in the formation of a partially folded intermediate without disulfide linkages. Mass spectrometry experiments on alkylated scFv were carried out at each stage to determine the effects of l-arginine. The spectroscopic studies revealed two different pathways for scFv refolding in the stepwise dialysis system, pathways that depended on whether l-arginine was present. Controlled coupling of the effects of GSSG and l-arginine led to the complete refolding of scFv in the stepwise dialysis.	2003 Mar	Umetsu Mitsuo,Tsumoto Kouhei,Hara Masaki,Ashish Kumar,Goda Shuichiro,Adschiri Tadafumi,Kumagai Izumi	The Journal of biological chemistry. 278(11) 8979-87	Single Chain Fv	EVQLVESGGGVVRPGGSLRISCAASGFTFDDYGMSWVRQAPGKGLEWVSGINWNGGSTGYADSVKGRFTISRDNAKNSLYLQMNSLRAEDTAVYYCARRRYALDYWGQGTLV		Q9HCC1			7.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
15596356	Expression, refolding, and purification of recombinant human granzyme B.	Granzyme B (GrB) is a member of a family of serine proteases involved in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated killing of potentially harmful cells, where GrB induces apoptosis by cleavage of a limited number of substrates. To investigate the suitability of GrB as an enzyme for specific fusion protein cleavage, two derivatives of human GrB, one dependent on blood coagulation factor Xa (FXa) cleavage for activation and one engineered to be self-activating, were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Both derivatives contain a hexa-histidine affinity tag fused to the C-terminus and expressed as inclusion bodies. These were isolated and solubilized in guanidiniumHCl, immobilized on a Ni2+-NTA agarose column, and refolded by application of a cyclic refolding protocol. The refolded pro-rGrB-H6 could be converted to a fully active form by cleavage with FXa or, for pro(IEPD)-rGrB-H6, by autocatalytic processing during the final purification step. A self-activating derivative in which the unpaired cysteine of human GrB was substituted with phenylalanine was also prepared. Both rGrB-H6 and the C228F mutant were found to be highly specific and efficient processing enzymes for the cleavage of fusion proteins, as demonstrated by cleavage of fusion proteins containing the IEPD recognition sequence of GrB.	2005 Jan	Lorentsen Rikke H,Fynbo Charlotte H,Thøgersen Hans C,Etzerodt Michael,Holtet Thor L	Protein expression and purification. 39(1) 18-26	Granzyme B	MGSIEGRIIGGHEAKPHSRPYMAYLMIWDQKSLKRCGFLIQDDFVLTAAHCWGSSINVTLGAHNIKEQEPTQQFIPVKRPIPHPAYNPKNFSNDIMLLQLERKAKRTRAVQPLRLPSNKAQVKPGQTCSVAGWGQTAPLGKHSHTLQEVKMTVQEDRKCESDLRHYYDSTIELCVGDPEIKKTSFKGDSGGPLVCNKVAQGIVSYGRNNGMPPRACTKVSSFVHWIKKTMKRYLNSHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahis + pro seq	P10144			8	10	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The major immunodominant integral outer membrane protein C (OmpC) from Salmonella typhi Ty21a was overexpressed, without the signal peptide, in Escherichia coli. The protein aggregates as inclusion bodies (IBs) in the cytoplasm. OmpC from IBs was solubilized with 4 M urea and refolded. This involved rapid dilution of unfolded OmpC into a refolding buffer containing polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether (C(12)E(9)) and glycerol. The refolded OmpC (rfOmpC) was shown to be structurally similar to the native OmpC by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, tryptic digestion, ultrafiltration, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. Crystals of rfOmpC were obtained in preliminary crystallization trials. The rfOmpC also sets a stage for rational design by recombinant DNA technology for vaccine design and high resolution structure determination.	2005 Mar	Kumar P D,Krishnaswamy S	Protein expression and purification. 40(1) 126-33	Outer membrane protein C	MEIYNKDGNKLDLFGKVDGLHYFSDDKGSDGDQTYMRIGFKGETQVNDQLTGYGQWEYQIQGNQTEGSNDSWTRVAFAGLKFADAGSFDYGRNYGVTYDVTSWTDVLPEFGGDTYGADNFMQQRGNGYATYRNTDFFGLVDGLDFALQYQGKNGSVSGENTNGRSLLNQNGDGYGGSLTYAIGEGFSVGGAITTSKRTADQNNTANARLYGNGDRATVYTGGLKYDANNIYLAAQYSQTYNATRFGTSNGSNPSTSYGFANKAQNFEVVAQYQFDFGLRPSVAYLQSKGKDISNGYGASYGDQDIVKYVDVGATYYFNKNMSTYVDYKINLLDKNDFTRDAGINTDDIVALGLVYQF		P0A263			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
15063609	Bacterial expression and refolding of human trypsinogen.	The expression of recombinant trypsinogens from different mammalian origins in Escherichia coli typically leads to the formation of insoluble aggregates. This work describes the high level expression of human trypsinogen 1 in E. coli using the T7 expression system. Direct expression of trypsinogen was not possible, but the N-terminal fusion of the first 11 amino acids of the T7 protein 10 resulted in an expression level of 200 mg g(-1) bacterial dry mass. A refolding procedure was optimized, and a method using continuous feed of denatured product was developed. Thus the working concentration of trypsinogen could be raised four-fold, while the yield of active protein could be maintained at 20-35%. The refolded trypsinogen was converted to trypsin by autocatalytic activation, and the utility for the detachment of mammalian cells in culture was proven.	2004 Apr	Hohenblum Hubertus,Vorauer-Uhl Karola,Katinger Hermann,Mattanovich Diethard	Journal of biotechnology. 109(1-2) 3-11	Trypsinogen	MASMTGGQQMGRGSAPFDDDDKIVGGYNCEENSVPYQVSLNSGYHFCGGSLINEQWVVSAGHCYKSRIQVRLGEHNIEVLEGNEQFINAAKIIRHPQYDRKTLNNDIMLIKLSSRAVINARVSTISLPTAPPATGTKCLISGWGNTASSGADYPDELQCLDAPVLSQAKCEASYPGKITSNMFCVGFLEGGKDSCQGDSGGPVVCNGQLQGVVSWGDGCAQKNKPGVYTKVYNYVKWIKNTIAANS		P07477			8.6	5	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14970911	Refolding and characterization of recombinant human GST-PD-1 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli.	Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a costimulatory molecule of CD28 family expressed on activated T, B and myeloid cells. The engagement of PD-1 with its two ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, inhibits proliferation of T cell and production of a series of its cytokines. The blockade of PD-1 pathway is involved in antiviral and antitumoral immunity. In this study, human PD-1 cDNA encoding extracellular domain was amplified and cloned into expression plasmid pGEX-5x-3. The fusion protein GST-PD-1 was effectively expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as inclusion bodies and a denaturation and refolding procedure was performed to obtain bioactive soluble GST-PD-1. Fusion protein of above 95d0c850urity was acquired by a convenient two-step purification using GST affinity and size exclusion columns. Furthermore, a PD-L1-dependent in vitro bioassay method was set up to characterize GST-PD-1 bioactivity. The results suggested that GST-PD-1 could competently block the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 and increase the production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma of phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells.	2004 Feb	Li Da-Wei,Yu Jian-Feng,Chen Yong-Jing,Ma Hong-Bing,Wang Zheng-Fei,Zhu Yi-Bei,Zhang Xue-Gang	Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica. 36(2) 141-6	Programmed cell death protein 1	MSPILGYWKIKGLVQPTRLLLEYLEEKYEEHLYERDEGDKWRNKKFELGLEFPNLPYYIDGDVKLTQSMAIIRYIADKHNMLGGCPKERAEISMLEGAVLDIRYGVSRIAYSKDFETLKVDFLSKLPEMLKMFEDRLCHKTYLNGDHVTHPDFMLYDALDVVLYMDPMCLDAFPKLVCFKKRIEAIPQIDKYLKSSKYIAWPLQGWQATFGGGDHPPKSDLIEGRGMQIPQAPWPVVWAVLQLGWRPGWFLDSPDRPWNPPTFFPALLVVTEGDNATFTCSFSNTSESFVLNWYRMSPSNQTDKLAAFPEDRSQPGQDCRFRVTQLPNGRDFHMSVVRARRNDSGTYLCGAISLAPKAQIKESLRAELRVTERRAEVPTAHPSPSPRPAGQFQTLVVGVVGGLLGSLVLLVWVLAVICSRAARGTIGARRTGQPLKEDPSAVPVFSVDYGELDFQWREKTPEPPVPCVPEQTEYATIVFPSGMGTSSPARRGSADGPRSAQPLRPEDGHCSWPL	N-terminal GST	Q15116			7.3	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12659842	One-step on-column affinity refolding purification and functional analysis of recombinant human VDAC1.	The outer mitochondrial membrane porin, voltage-dependent anion-selective channel (VDAC), is believed to play an important role in mediating mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. However, detailed structure-function studies of VDAC have been hindered by the difficulties to obtain a soluble, correctly folded, and fully active form of the recombinant VDAC and its mutant variants due to its transmembrane nature. Here we report a high-throughput one-step chromatographic procedure in purification of recombinant human VDAC1 (rhVDAC1) protein overexpressed in bacteria. The improved methodology could generate a large quantity of rhVDAC1 with correct folding in terms of the secondary structure, with full biological activities in mediating cytochrome c release and in interaction with Bcl-X(L). The method will significantly benefit genetic, biochemical, and structural studies of this critical channel protein.	2003 Apr	Shi Yong,Jiang Chunsun,Chen Quan,Tang Hong	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 303(2) 475-82	Voltage-dependent Anion Channel 1	MRGSHHHHHHAVPPTYADLGKSARDVFTKGYGFGLIKLDLKTKSENGLEFTSSGSANTETTKVTGSLETKYRWTEYGLTFTEKWNTDNTLGTEITVEDQLARGLKLTFDSSFSPNTGKKNAKIKTGYKREHINLGCDMDFDIAGPSIRGALVLGYEGWLAGYQMNFETAKSRVTQSNFAVGYKTDEFQLHTNVNDGTEFGGSIYQKVNKKLETAVNLAWTAGNSNTRFGIAAKYQIDPDACFSAKVNNSSLIGLGYTQTLKPGIKLTLSALLDGKNVNAGGHKLGLGLEFQA	Other constructs also refolded:aa 1-100, 1-145, 1-196, 1-245, 12-283, 24-283, 127-283, 176-283,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P21796			7.9	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15003262	Prevention of aggregation after refolding by balanced stabilization-destabilization: production of the Arabidopsis thaliana protein APG8a (At4g21980) for NMR structure determination.	The gene coding for APG8a (At4g21980), a protein from Arabidopsis thaliana, is involved in the autophagy process. The protein is an interesting candidate for structure determination by NMR spectroscopy. Toward this end, APG8a fused to an N-terminal His-tag has been expressed in Escherichia coli under a T7 expression system, refolded in vitro, and kept soluble by slight destabilization. The expressed protein appeared in both the soluble and the insoluble fractions. The whole-cell lysate was denatured by the addition of guanidinium chloride. The protein was immobilized on nickel-agarose resin and refolded by stepwise decrement of the denaturant. The elution buffer was 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 1 0lycerol, 0.5 M urea, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 M imidazole. After the removal of imidazole by ultrafiltration, the His-tag was cleaved with biotinylated thrombin. The protein product was kept in 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, with 1 0lycerol, 0.5 M urea, and 300 mM NaCl. The protein was found to aggregate extensively over time if any one of the three ingredients (sodium chloride, urea, or glycerol) was omitted. The yield of the protein was around 20 mg/L Luria-Bertani culture medium. The (1)H-(15)N NMR correlation spectrum of (15)N-labeled APG8a showed the characteristic signature of a folded protein; thus, the solutes appear to have no deleterious effect on the sample. These solution conditions kept the protein soluble and unaggregated for at least 2 days (enough time for NMR data collection). This approach of balanced stabilization-destabilization may offer a general approach for structural investigations of proteins that tend to aggregate.	2004 Apr	Chae Young Kee,Im Hana,Zhao Qin,Doelling Jed H,Vierstra Richard D,Markley John L	Protein expression and purification. 34(2) 280-3	APG8a (At4g21980) autophagy protein	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMAKSSFKISNPLEARMSESSRIREKYPDRIPVIVEKAGQSDVPDIDKKKYLVPADLTVGQFVYVVRKRIKLGAEKAIFVFVKNTLPPTAALMSAIYEEHKDEDGFLYMTYSGENTFGSLTVARAPPPPPPLRSGC	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8LEM4			7	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
11087689	Expression, refolding, and isotopic labeling of human serum albumin domains for NMR spectroscopy.	Many different compounds bind to human serum albumin (HSA), which can be a significant problem in the drug discovery process. To aid in the design of drug molecules that do not bind to HSA, the structures of HSA/ligand complexes would be very useful. However, little information has been reported on the structures of small molecules complexed to HSA. In this paper, we describe a procedure for preparing isotopically labeled domains of HSA for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. The procedure involves the expression in Escherichia coli, refolding, and a multistep purification. Domains I and III are capable of folding into stable structural units and producing well resolved (15)N/(1)H correlation spectra, whereas domain II forms significant aggregates at sub-millimolar concentration. Using our protocols, isotopically labeled and properly folded domains I and III can be effectively produced in large quantities for NMR-based structural studies and NMR-based screening.

12454477	The production, purification and crystallization of a soluble heterodimeric form of a highly selected T-cell receptor in its unliganded and liganded state.	T-cell antigen receptors (TcRs) are heterodimeric cell-surface receptors that play a pivotal role in the cellular immune response. The TcR interacts specifically with a peptide-laden major histocompatability complex (pMHC). A human TcR has been characterized that interacts with an immunodominant epitope, FLRGRAYGL, from the Epstein-Barr virus, a ubiquitous human pathogen, in complex with HLA-B8. Despite the vast TcR repertoire, this TcR is found in up to 100f the total T-cell population in seropositive HLA-B8+ individuals. In this report, this highly selected TcR is characterized by expressing in Escherichia coli, refolding, purifying and crystallizing the receptor. In addition, the HLA-B8-FLRGRAYGL complex has been expressed in E. coli, refolded and shown to be functionally active. Using native gel electrophoresis, the refolded TcR is shown to be capable of binding specifically to the refolded HLA-B8-FLRGRAYGL and this TcR has been crystallized in complex with the pMHC. The crystals of the unliganded and liganded TcR diffract to 1.5 and 2.5 A, respectively.	2002 Dec	Clements Craig S,Kjer-Nielsen Lars,MacDonald Whitney A,Brooks Andrew G,Purcell Anthony W,McCluskey James,Rossjohn Jamie	Acta crystallographica.

15555941	Expression, purification and structural characterization of the scaffoldin hydrophilic X-module from the cellulosome of Clostridium thermocellum.	The cellulosome is a membrane-bound, extracellular multi-subunit complex responsible for the degradation of crystalline cellulose by a number of organisms including anaerobic bacteria and fungi. The hydrophilic X-module (CipA-X) from the modular scaffoldin subunit of Clostridium thermocellum cellulosome has been proposed to play various roles in cellulosomal function, including thermal and structural stability. Towards elucidating the function of CipA-X using structural and biophysical studies, the region comprising residues 1692-1785 from the C. thermocellum CipA cDNA encoding CipA-X was cloned into a pET21b expression vector. When expressed in Escherichia coli, the C-terminal His-tagged protein accumulated in the insoluble fraction. Cell fractionation experiments showed that the recombinant protein was localized to inclusion bodies. Refolding and purification involved denaturation of the whole cell lysate by addition of urea, followed by a nickel-Sepharose chromatography step and dialysis into native conditions (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, and 10 mM EDTA). A final gel filtration step purified the protein to homogeneity, yielding 40 mg/L. The two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation spectrum of uniformly 15N-labelled CipA-X showed the characteristics of a well-folded protein comprising significant beta-structure, which is in agreement with the circular dichroism data.	2004 Dec	Adams Jarrett J,Jang Christopher J,Spencer Holly L,Elliott Marc,Smith Steven P	Protein expression and purification. 38(2) 258-63	CipA scaffoldin	NPVIEGYKVSGYILPDFSFDATVAPLVKAGFKVEIVGTELYAVTDANGYFEITGVPANASGYTLKISRATYLDRVIANVVVTGDTSVSTSQAPHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q06851		X-module, aa.1692-1785	7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
15039059	Refolding and purification of unprocessed porcine myostatin expressed in Escherichia coli.	Myostatin is a member of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, and it acts as a negative regulator for skeletal muscle growth. Like many other TGF-beta family member proteins, the mature form of myostatin is a homodimer that is processed post-translationally from a precursor form of myostatin. Since the presence of a prodomain is essential for proper folding and homodimer assembly for some members of the TGF-beta superfamily, we compared the refolding in vitro of porcine unprocessed and mature myostatin over-expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. A high alkaline buffer solution containing a mild anionic detergent and a reducing agent was used to solubilize the myostatin inclusion bodies. An optimal condition for refolding was obtained by rapid dilution of the solubilized protein in a buffer system containing reduced and oxidized glutathione, and subsequent incubation at 4 degrees C for at least 7 days. The unprocessed porcine myostatin demonstrated reversible disulfide bond formation after refolding, a characteristic of the native form of myostatin. In contrast, the mature myostatin formed aggregates that did not demonstrate reversible disulfide bond formation in the refolding condition used in this study. These results demonstrate the importance of the myostatin prodomain in facilitating the proper folding of mature myostatin. Reaction of the refolded, unprocessed myostatin with furin, an endopeptidase cleaving between paired basic residues, yielded prodomain and mature myostatin, demonstrating that the unprocessed myostatin is a substrate for furin. The prodomain did not form disulfide bond formation but the mature myostatin demonstrated reversible disulfide-linked homodimer formation. It is concluded that myostatin prodomain facilitates the proper folding of myostatin, and the refolded, native form of unprocessed myostatin could be obtained in high yield (15%) after E. coli expression as inclusion bodies.	2004 May	Jin Hyung-Joo,Dunn Michael A,Borthakur Dulal,Kim Yong Soo	Protein expression and purification. 35(1) 1-10	Myostatin	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPTLNENSEQKENVEKEGLCNACMWRQNTKSSRLEAIKIQILSKLRLETAPNISKDAIRQLLPKAPPLRELIDQYDVQRDDSSDGSLEDDDYHATTETIITMPTESDLLMQVEGKPKCCFFKFSSKIQYNKVVKAQLWIYLRPVKTPTTVFVQILRLIKPMKDGTRYTGIRSLKLDMNPGTGIWQSIDVKTVLQNWLKQPESNLGIEIKALDENGHDLAVTFPGPGEDGLNPFLEVKVTDTPKRSRRDFGLDCDEHSTESRCCRYPLTVDFEAFGWDWIIAPKRYKANYCSGECEFVFLQKYPHTHLVHQANPRGSAGPCCTPTKMSPINMLYFNGKEQIIYGKIPAMVVDRCGCS	N-terminal hexahis + pro seq	O18831			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

12030845	Nucleotide binding to human uncoupling protein-2 refolded from bacterial inclusion bodies.	Experiments were performed to test the hypothesis that recombinant human uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) ectopically expressed in bacterial inclusion bodies binds nucleotides in a manner identical with the nucleotide-inhibited uncoupling that is observed in kidney mitochondria. For this, sarkosyl-solubilized UCP2 inclusion bodies were treated with the polyoxyethylene ether detergent C12E9 and hydroxyapatite. Protein recovered from hydroxyapatite chromatography was approx. 90d0c850ure UCP2, as judged by Coomassie Blue and silver staining of polyacrylamide gels. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, N-methylanthraniloyl-tagged purine nucleoside di- and tri-phosphates exhibited enhanced fluorescence with purified UCP2. Dissociation constants determined by least-squares non-linear regression indicated that the affinity of UCP2 for these fluorescently tagged nucleotides was 3-5 microM or perhaps an order of magnitude stronger, depending on the model used. Competition experiments with [8-14C]ATP demonstrated that UCP2 binds unmodified purine and pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates with 2-5 microM affinity. Affinities for ADP and GDP were approx. 10-fold lower. These data indicate that: UCP2 (a) is at least partially refolded from sarkosyl-solubilized bacterial inclusion bodies by a two-step treatment with C12E9 detergent and hydroxyapatite; (b) binds purine and pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates with low micromolar affinity; (c) binds GDP with the same affinity as GDP inhibits superoxide-stimulated uncoupling by kidney mitochondria; and (d) exhibits a different nucleotide preference than kidney mitochondria.	2002 Sep	Jekabsons Mika B,Echtay Karim S,Brand Martin D	The Biochemical journal. 366(Pt 2) 565-71	Uncoupling protein 2	MVGFKATDVPPTATVKFLGAGTAACIADLITFPLDTAKVRLQIQGESQGPVRATASAQYRGVMGTILTMVRTEGPRSLYNGLVAGLQRQMSFASVRIGLYDSVKQFYTKGSEHASIGSRLLAGSTTGALAVAVAQPTDVVKVRFQAQARAGGGRRYQSTVNAYKTIAREEGFRGLWKGTSPNVARNAIVNCAELVTYDLIKDALLKANLMTDDLPCHFTSAFGAGFCTTVIASPVDVVKTRYMNSALGQYSSAGHCALTMLQKEGPRAFYKGFMPSFLRLGSWNVVMFVTYEQLKRALMAACTSREAPF		P55851			7.3	4	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15016803	Folding of active calcium channel beta(1b) -subunit by size-exclusion chromatography and its role on channel function.	Voltage-gated calcium channels mediate the influx of Ca(2+) ions into eukaryotic cells in response to membrane depolarization. They are hetero-multimer membrane proteins formed by at least three subunits, the poreforming alpha(1)-subunit and the auxiliary beta- and alpha(2)delta-subunits. The beta-subunit is essential for channel performance because it regulates two distinct features of voltage-gated calcium channels, the surface expression and the channel activity. Four beta-subunit genes have been cloned, beta(1-4), with molecular masses ranging from 52 to 78 kDa, and several splice variants have been identified. The beta(1b)-subunit, expressed at high levels in mammalian brain, has been used extensively to study the interaction between the pore forming alpha(1)- and the regulatory beta-subunit. However, structural characterization has been impaired for its tendency to form aggregates when expressed in bacteria. We applied an on-column refolding procedure based on size exclusion chromatography to fold the beta(1b)-subunit of the voltage gated-calcium channels from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. The beta(1b)-subunit refolds into monomers, as shown by sucrose gradient analysis, and binds to a glutathione S-transferase protein fused to the known target in the alpha(1)-subunit (the alpha-interaction domain). Using the cut-open oocyte voltage clamp technique, we measured gating and ionic currents in Xenopus oocytes expressing cardiac alpha(1)-subunit (alpha(1C)) co-injected with folded-beta(1b)-protein or beta(1b)-cRNA. We demonstrate that the co-expression of the alpha(1C)-subunit with either folded-beta(1b)-protein or beta(1b)-cRNA increases ionic currents to a similar extent and with no changes in charge movement, indicating that the beta(1b)-subunit primarily modulates channel activity, rather than expression.	2004 May	Neely Alan,Garcia-Olivares Jennie,Voswinkel Stephan,Horstkott Hannelore,Hidalgo Patricia	The Journal of biological chemistry. 279(21) 21689-94	Calcium Channel Beta1b-subunit	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPSPQGKYSKRKGRFKRSDGSTSSDTTSNSFVRQGSAESYTSRPSDSDVSLEEDREALRKEAERQALAQLEKAKTKPVAFAVRTNVGYNPSPGDEVPVQGVAITFEPKDFLHIKEKYNNDWWIGRLVKEGCEVGFIPSPVKLDSLRLLQEQTLRQNRLSSSKSGDNSSSSLGDVVTGTRRPTPPASAKQKQKSTEHVPPYDVVPSMRPIILVGPSLKGYEVTDMMQKALFDFLKHRFDGRISITRVTADISLAKRSVLNNPSKHIIIERSNTRSSLAEVQSEIERIFELARTLQLVALDADTINHPAQLSKTSLAPIIVYIKITSPKVLQRLIKSRGKSQSKHLNVQIAASEKLAQCPPEMFDIILDENQLEDACEHLAEYLEAYWKATHPPSRTPPNPLLNRTMATAALAVSPAPVSNLQGPYLVSGDQPLDRATGEHASVHEYPGELGQPPGLYPSNHPPGRAGTLWALSRQDTFDADTPGSRNSVYTEPGDSCVDMETDPSEGPGPGDPAGGGTPPARQGSWEEEEDYEEEMTDNRNRGRNKARYCAEGGGPVLGRNKNELEGWGQGVYIR	Sequence expressed and refolded: aa.24-597,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P54283			8	12	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
11248071	Ligand-independent assembly of recombinant human CD1 by using oxidative refolding chromatography.	CD1 is an MHC class I-like antigen-presenting molecule consisting of a heavy chain and beta(2)-microglobulin light chain. The in vitro refolding of synthetic MHC class I molecules has always required the presence of ligand. We report here the use of a folding method using an immobilized chaperone fragment, a protein disulphide isomerase, and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (oxidative refolding chromatography) for the fast and efficient assembly of ligand-free and ligand-associated CD1a and CD1b, starting with material synthesized in Escherichia coli. The results suggest that &quot;empty&quot; MHC class I-like molecules can assemble and remain stable at physiological temperatures in the absence of ligand. The use of oxidative refolding chromatography thus is extended to encompass complex multisubunit proteins and specifically to members of the extensive, functionally diverse and important immunoglobulin supergene family of proteins, including those for which a ligand has yet to be identified.	2001 Mar	Altamirano M M,Woolfson A,Donda A,Shamshiev A,Briseño-Roa L,Foster N W,Veprintsev D B,De Libero G,Fersht A R,Milstein C	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 98(6) 3288-93	CD1a	MNPDGLKEPLSFHVIWIASFYNHSWKQNLVSGWLSDLQTHTWDSNSSTIVFLWPWSRGNFSNEEWKELETLFRIRTIRSFEGIRRYAHELQFEYPFEIQVTGGCELHSGKVSGSFLQLAYQGSDFVSFQNNSWLPYPVAGNMAKHFCKVLNQNQHENDITHNLLSDTCPRFILGLLDAGKAHLQRQVKPEAWLSHGPSPGPGHLQLVCHVSGFYPKPVWVMWMRGEQEQQGTQRGDILPSADGTWYLRATLEVAAGEAADLSCRVKHSSLEGQDIVLYWEHHGS		P06126			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

15047176	Molecular cloning, overexpression, and characterization of the ligand-binding D2 domain of fibroblast growth factor receptor.	Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) regulate a wide range of important cellular processes. The biological activities of FGFs are mediated by cell surface receptors (FGFRs). In the present study for the first time we report the cloning, expression, and characterization of the ligand (FGF)-binding D2 domain of human FGFR2. D2 domain is expressed in Escherichia coli in high yields (10 mg/L) as inclusion bodies. The protein is recovered by dissolving the inclusion bodies in 8 M urea and subsequently refolding on nickel affinity column. The protein is purified (to approximately 97d0c850urity) to homogeneity using heparin-Sepharose affinity column. Far-UV circular dichroism data and chemical shift index plot based on 1H-alpha, 13C-alpha, 13C-beta, and 13carbonyl group chemical shifts suggest that D2 domain is an all beta-sheet protein consisting of 9 beta-strands. Isothermal titration calorimetry and equilibrium urea unfolding experiments show that recombinant D2 domain is in a biologically active conformation and binds strongly to its ligand (FGF) and to the heparin analog, sucrose octasulfate (SOS). Using a variety of triple resonance NMR experiments, complete assignment of 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances in D2 domain has been accomplished. The findings of the present study not only pave way for an in-depth investigation of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the activation of FGF signaling but also provide avenues for the rational design of potent inhibitors against FGF-mediated pathogenesis.	2004 Apr	Hung Kuo-Wei,Kumar T K S,Chi Ya-Hui,Chiu Ing-Ming,Yu Chin	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 317(1) 253-8	Fibroblast growth factor receptor	MNSNNKRAPYWTNTEKMEKRLHAVPAANTVKFRCPAGGNPMPTMRWLKNGKEFKQEHRIGGYKVRNQHWSLIMESVVPSDKGNYTCVVENEYGSINHTYHLDVVMDIGINSDPNSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P21802		Ligand-binding domain aa.125-249	7.5	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
12071712	Bacterial expression and in vitro refolding of a single-chain fv antibody specific for human plasma apolipoprotein B-100.	From the cloned heavy and light chains of a murine monoclonal antibody (mAbB23) which is specific for human apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 of plasma low-density lipoproteins, a vector was designed for expression of a single-chain antibody (scFv) of mAbB23 in Escherichia coli. The expression vector was constructed so that the scFv gene (V(L)-linker-V(H)) was expressed under the control of the T7 promoter. The inclusion body of scFv was isolated from E. coli lysate and solubilized in 6 M guanidine-hydrochloride without reducing agents, followed by refolding through slow dilution into refolding buffer. After complete removal of the remaining denaturant by dialysis, the soluble scFv was purified through an apo B-100-coupled affinity column, and an active fraction, which had an antigen-binding activity comparable with that of native Fab, was easily obtained. The expression and in vitro refolding of scFv resulted in production of an active molecule in a yield of 15-20 mg per 1-liter flask cultivation.	2002 Jun	Lee Myung-Hoon,Park Tae-In,Park Yong-Bok,Kwak Ju-Won	Protein expression and purification. 25(1) 166-73	scFv mAbB23, specific for apolipoprotein B-100	MQAVVTQESALTTSPGETVTLTCRSNTGAVTTSNYASWVQEKPDHLFTGLIGGTNNRVPGVPARFSGSLIGDKAALTITGAQTEDEAIYFCALWNSNHWVFGGGTKLTVLGGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSEVQLVESGPGLVAPSQSLSITCTVSGFSLTDYGVSWIRQPPGKGLEWLGVIWAGGSTFYNSALKSRLSINKDNSKSQVFLKMNSLHTDDTAMYYCVKHEDRYDWYFDVWGAGTTVTVSS	V-light chain - linker - V-heavy chain				8	20	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14763853	Solid-phase refolding of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase adsorbed on cation-exchange resin.	Expression with a fusion partner is now a popular scheme to produce a protein of interest because it provides a generic tool for expression and purification. In our previous study, a strong polycationic tail has been harnessed for an efficient purification scheme. Here, the same polycation tail attached to a protein of interest is shown to hold versatility for a solid-phase refolding method that utilizes a charged adsorbent as a supporting material. Cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase) fused with 10 lysine residues at the C-terminus (CGTK10ase) retains the ability to bind to a cation exchanger even in a urea-denatured state. When the denatured and adsorbed CGTK10ase is induced to refold, the bound CGTK10ase aggregates little even at a g/L range. The renatured CGTK10ase can also be simply recovered from the solid support by adding high concentration of NaCl. The CGTK10ase refolded on a solid support retains specific enzyme activity virtually identical to that of the native CGTK10ase. Several factors that are important in improving the refolding efficiency are explored. Experimental results indicate that nonspecific electrostatic interactions between the charge of the ion exchanger and the local charge of CGTase other than the polycationic tag should be reduced to obtain higher refolding yield. The solid-phase refolding method utilizing a strong polycationic tag resulted in a remarkable increase in the refolding performance. Taken together with the previous report in which a series of polycations were explored for efficient purification, expression of a target protein fused with a strong polycation provides a straightforward protein preparation scheme.

9831393	Highly efficient recovery of functional single-chain Fv fragments from inclusion bodies overexpressed in Escherichia coli by controlled introduction of oxidizing reagent--application to a human single-chain Fv fragment.	An improved and efficient refolding system for a single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli was developed. Stepwise removal of denaturing reagent and controlled addition of oxidizing reagent were found to be the most effective conditions to achieve for almost complete recovery of functional monomeric scFv from inclusion bodies. Adding L-arginine to the refolding solution also increased the yield of refolded functional scFv. The single-chain Fv fragments of both a mouse anti-lysozyme monoclonal antibody, HyHEL10, and a human monoclonal antibody against the D antigen of the Rh blood group, D10, in solubilized inclusion bodies could be refolded under these conditions with yields of up to 95%. The refolding procedures developed in this study will contribute to providing a stable supply of large amounts of human single-chain Fv fragments.	1998 Oct	Tsumoto K,Shinoki K,Kondo H,Uchikawa M,Juji T,Kumagai I	Journal of immunological methods. 219(1-2) 119-29	Single chain Fv HyHEL-10					None	7.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8086830	Effects of amino acid variations in recombinant Der fII on its human IgE and mouse IgG recognition.	Amino acid sequencing of the major mite allergen Der fII purified from mite body extract revealed that it is a mixture of at least two variants. Substitutions were found only at positions in which amino acid variations were predicted from the nucleotide sequences of three cloned cDNAs. When cDNAs corresponding to the three variants were expressed in Escherichia coli, Der fII proteins were produced as inclusion bodies. Denaturation and renaturation with urea converted recombinant Der fII into a protein with three intramolecular disulfide bonds (Cys8-Cys119, Cys21-Cys27, and Cys73-Cys78), which were identical to those previously identified in native Der fII. All the variants, including native Der fII, were equally recognized by human IgE antibodies from 14 different sera of mite-allergic patients. These results suggested that recombinant Der fII proteins assumed a conformation identical to that of the native Der fII and that all the Der fII variants acted as allergens. This result also suggested that IgE antibody binds to the region where there were no amino acid variations. The binding ability of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 18G8 for the variant clones 1, 2, and 11 Der fII was almost the same. However, mAb 15E11 bound to clone 1 Der fII more efficiently than to clones 2 and 11, whereas mAb 13A4 recognized clone 2 Der fII as the most preferable antigen. This suggested that these antibodies recognized the region of amino acid variations. The stability of Der fII variants was analyzed by measuring their IgE antibody binding activity after heating, freezing, or acid treatment, and was analyzed by resistance to trypsin digestion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1994 Sep	Nishiyama C,Yuuki T,Usui Y,Iwamoto N,Okumura Y,Okudaira H	International archives of allergy and immunology. 105(1) 62-9	Der f2	DQVDVKDCANNEIKKVMVDGCHGSDPCIIHRGKPFTLEALFDANQNTKTAKIEIKASLDGLEIDVPGIDTNACHFMKCPLVKGQQYDIKYTWNVPKIAPKSENVVVTVKLIGDNGVLACAIATHGKIRD		Q00855			8.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
14550648	Molecular cloning, overexpression in Escherichia coli, and purification of 6x his-tagged C-terminal domain of Clostridium difficile toxins A and B.	Genomic DNA from ribotype-01 and -17 Clostridium difficile strains was used for amplification of the sequences encoding the carboxy-terminal domain of toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB). The deduced C-terminal TcdB ribotype-01 and -17 domains share 99.5% amino acid sequence identity while TcdA ribotype-17 comprises a 607 amino acid deletion compared to TcdA-01. When compared to previously sequenced C. difficile toxins, 99.3% amino acid identity was found between TcdA-01 and TcdA from strain VPI10643 and 98.8 0dentity between TcdA-17 and TcdA from strain F-1470. The obtained sequences were fused in 3&#39; to a sequence encoding a hexahistidine tag and cloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector. The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified using single-step metal-chelate chromatography. The recombinant carboxy-terminal domain of TcdA-01 was purified from the soluble E. coli lysate fraction whereas TcdA-17 and TcdB-17 carboxy-terminal domains were purified from inclusion bodies. At least 40 mg of each protein was purified per liter of bacterial culture. The recombinant toxin domains were detected specifically by Western blot and ELISA with antibodies against native C. difficile toxins. This study demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal domains of TcdA and TcdB can be produced using an E. coli expression system and easily purified. These recombinant, stable, and non-toxic proteins provide a convenient source for use in the diagnosis of C. difficile infections, instead of native toxins, as controls and calibrators in immunoassay kits and to obtain specific monoclonal antibodies.	2003 Oct	Letourneur Odile,Ottone Sophie,Delauzun Vincent,Bastide Marie-Claire,Foussadier Agnès	Protein expression and purification. 31(2) 276-85	EnterotoxinA C-terminal domain	MRGSEESNKKILQKIRIKGILSNTQSFNKMSIDFKDIKKLSLGYIMSNFKSFNSENELDRDHLGFKIIDNKTYYYDEASKLVKGLININNSLFYFDPIESNLVTGWQTINGKKYYFDINTGAASTSYKIINGKHFYFNNNGVMQLGVFKGPDGFEYFAPANTQNNNIEGQAIVYQSKFLTLNGKKYYFDNDSKAVTGWQTIDGKKYYFNLNTAEAATGWQTIDGKKYYFNTNTSIASTGYTIINGKHFYFNTDGIMQIGVFKGPDGFEYFAPANTDANNIEGQAIRYQNRFLYLHDNIYYFGNNSKAVTGWQTINGNVYYFMPDTAHHHHHH	See UniProt ID: O32351_CLODI for sequence used in this study,C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P16154		C-terminal domain with a 607aa intrachain deletion, aa.1753-2681	8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

11162408	High-yield expression, purification, and characterization of the recombinant diisopropylfluorophosphatase from Loligo vulgaris.	Organophosphate degrading enzymes are of great interest in light of their ability to detoxify chemical warfare agents. The diisopropylfluorophosphatase (DFPase) from Loligo vulgaris is characterized by its high stability and broad substrate specifity. Here we report the production of large amounts of active, recombinant DFPase using an Escherichia coli expression system. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity using a combination of immobilized metal affinity and ion exchange chromatography. CD-spectroscopy indicates a well folded protein with a high amount of beta-sheet structure. Limited proteolysis was used to gain a deeper insight into the structural organization of the protein. DFPase possesses an internal protease-sensitive region located between amino acids 146 and 149. The two proteolytic fragments remain as a tight complex retaining a DFPase activity comparable to the intact enzyme. Overexpression clones for each fragment were constructed with the expression resulting in the formation of inclusion bodies. Upon isolation and refolding active protein is only formed when both fragments are present. Thus, the two proteolytic fragments are probably part of a stable single-domain protein with multiple contacts between them and only one protease accessible surface loop.	2001 Feb	Hartleib J,Rüterjans H	Protein expression and purification. 21(1) 210-9	Diisopropylfluorophosphatase	MEIPVIEPLFTKVTEDIPGAEGPVFDKNGDFYIVAPEVEVNGKPAGEILRIDLKTGKKTVICKPEVNGYGGIPAGCQCDRDANQLFVADMRLGLLVVQTDGTFEEIAKKDSEGRRMQGCNDCAFDYEGNLWITAPAGE		Q7SIG4			6.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
11272849	Direct expression of the extracellular portion of human FcepsilonRIalpha chain as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.	The extracellular portion of the alpha chain of the human high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRIalpha) was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. In immunoblot analysis, two bands were reactive to human IgE and mouse anti-human FcepsilonRIalpha monoclonal antibodies. N-terminal sequencing showed that the two bands were equivalent to the soluble FcepsilonRIalpha with a methionine residue at the N-terminus (Met-1-172) and 23-172, in which the N-terminal 22 residues of the soluble FcepsilonRIalpha have been removed, possibly by degradation in E. coli cells. IgE-binding to CHO cells expressing FcepsilonRI was inhibited by the addition of the recombinant products prepared by the refolding procedure from inclusion bodies. The system for the expression of soluble human FcepsilonRIalpha in E. coli presented in this study and its further improvement would be useful for the production of the protein as a potent therapeutic and for analysis of the IgE-FcepsilonRIalpha interaction.	2001 Jan	Takai T,Okumura K,Ra C	Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry. 65(1) 79-85	High affinity immunoglobulin epsilon alpha chain	MVPQKPKVSLNPPWNRIFKGENVTLTCNGNNFFEVSSTKWFHNGSLSEETNSSLNIVNAKFEDSGEYKCQHQQVNESEPVYLEVFSDWLLLQASAEVVMEGQPLFLRCHGWRNWDVYKVIYYKDGEALKYWYENHNISITNATVEDSGTYYCTGKVWQLDYESEPLNITVIKA		P12319		Extracellular domain aa.1-172	8.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15039064	Optimized expression and refolding of human keratoepithelin in BL21 (DE3).	Keratoepithelin (KE) is an extracellular protein participating in cell adhesion and differentiation. Mutations of the KE gene (on 5q31 in humans) cause deposition of abnormal proteins (amyloid and non-amyloid) in corneal stroma and lead to several corneal dystrophies in humans. However, further studies on the KE protein have been limited by the intrinsic difficulty of purifying this protein. A high-expression plasmid containing human KE gene was constructed to generate recombinant KE proteins in Escherichia coli. The plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) and the recombinant protein was expressed as an insoluble His-tagged fusion protein and purified by nickel chelation affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. On average, 12 mg of purified KE was routinely obtained from 1L of culture media. The recombinant KE was refolded in arginine-containing dialysis solutions and the recovery of bioactive KE typically was approximately 70%. The procedures developed in this report should enable reproducible production of KE and related mutant proteins in large quantities and facilitate future studies on biochemical and biophysical properties of KE and the pathogenesis of related corneal dystrophies.	2004 May	Yuan Ching,Reuland Janice M,Lee Lyndon,Huang Andrew J W	Protein expression and purification. 35(1) 39-45	Keratoepithelin	MALFVRLLALALALALGPAATLAGPAKSPYQLVLQHSRLRGRQHGPNVCAVQKVIGTNRKYFTNCKQWYQRKICGKSTVISYECCPGYEKVPGEKGCPAALPLSNLYETLGVVGSTTTQLYTDRTEKLRPEMEGPGSFTIFAPSNEAWASLPAEVLDSLVSNVNIELLNALRYHMVGRRVLTDELKHGMTLTSMYQNSNIQIHHYPNGIVTVNCARLLKADHHATNGVVHLIDKVISTITNNIQQIIEIEDTFETLRAAVAASGLNTMLEGNGQYTLLAPTNEAFEKIPSETLNRILGDPEALRDLLNNHILKSAMCAEAIVAGLSVETLEGTTLEVGCSGDMLTINGKAIISNKDILATNGVIHYIDELLIPDSAKTLFELAAESDVSTAIDLFRQAGLGNHLSGSERLTLLAPLNSVFKDGTPPIDAHTRNLLRNHIIKDQLASKYLYHGQTLETLGGKKLRVFVYRNSLCIENSCIAAHDKRGRYGTLFTMDRVLTPPMGTVMDVLKGDNRFSMLVAAIQSAGLTETLNREGVYTVFAPTNEAFRALPPRERSRLLGDAKELANILKYHIGDEILVSGGIGALVRLKSLQGDKLEVSLKNNVVSVNKEPVAEPDIMATNGVVHVITNVLQPPANRPQERGDELADSALEIFKQASAFSRASQRSVRLAPVYQKLLERMKHHHHHHH	Protein also has a C-terminal HSV tag, but sequence details not provided,C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q15582			7.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The homotrimeric membrane channel porin from Rhodopseudomonas blastica was expressed without signal sequence in Escherichia coli. The protein assembled in inclusion bodies in the cytosol, from which it could be recovered using urea and detergents. After purification by anion-exchange chromatography, the protein crystallized under wild-type conditions. The X-ray structure was determined at 2.2 angstroms resolution, and a comparison with the known wild-type structure showed that the recombinant porin is identical at the atomic level. The method yields porin and designed mutants thereof in 100 mg amounts, allowing for detailed functional and mechanistic studies.	1996 Feb	Schmid B,Krömer M,Schulz G E	FEBS letters. 381(1-2) 111-4	Membrane channel porin	MEISLNGYGRFGLQYVEDRGVGLEDTIISSRLRINIVGTTETDQGVTFGAKLRMQWDDGDAFAGTAGNAAQFWTSYNGVTVSVGNVDTAFDSVALTYDSEMGYEASSFGDAQSSFFAYNSKYDASGALDNYNGIAVTYSISGVNLYLSYVDPDQTVDSSLVTEEFGIAADWSNDMISLAAAYTTDAGGIVDNDIAFVGAAYKFNDAGTVGLNWYDNGLSTAGDQVTLYGNYAFGATTVRAYVSDIDRAGADTAYGIGADYQFAEGVKVSGSVQSGFANETVADVGVRFDF		P39767			7.2	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
7952022	Procedure for refolding and purification of recombinant proteins from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies using a strong anion exchanger.	Using Escherichia coli system expressing papilloma virus HPV16 E7MS2 fusion protein as a model system, a novel procedure was applied to solubilize, purify and refold recombinant proteins from E. coli inclusion bodies. The necessity to reactivate proteins at low protein concentrations (owing to their tendency to aggregate at high concentrations) was overcome by solubilization of inclusion bodies in alkaline solution and immobilization of proteins on a strong and resistant anion exchanger. This procedure has an inherent advantage of combining refolding and purification procedures in one step. The solubilization of the fusion protein in an alkaline reagent with the use of an anion exchanger resulted in considerable purification of the recombinant protein at a fairly high concentration. The protein was soluble under mild conditions and reacted with antibodies against the &quot;native&quot; papilloma virus.	1994 Jun	Suttnar J,Dyr J E,Hamsíková E,Novák J,Vonka V	Journal of chromatography.

7538852	Laboratory-scale production and purification of recombinant HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.	HIV-1 reverse transcriptase from the HIV-1 strain WMF 1.13 was expressed in Escherichia coli JM 105 using a pKK233-2 vector. The bacteria were cultivated in a 20-l fermentor with 14-l net volume using M9ZB medium containing bactotryptone and yeast extract. After induction of reverse transcriptase (RT) expression by addition of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside the enzyme concentration was monitored. Both soluble and inclusion-body deposited RT were detected by Western blots. Inclusion-body formation was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Further purification of soluble and insoluble RT was investigated. After cell desintegration by enzymatic treatment combined with osmotic shock and centrifugation, the supernatant was desalted by size-exclusion chromatography and further purified by DEAE-Sepharose FF, AF-Heparin Toyopearl 650 M and Fractogel EMD TMAE 650 (S). The results of the purification steps were monitored by SDS-PAGE with silver staining, non-radioactive RT assay and protein determination with Coomassie Blue. The sediment was extracted with 6 M GuHCl and after clarification and conventional refolding, treated in the same manner as soluble RT. This method is well suited for studying fermentation conditions as well as purification conditions. The RT is expressed in approximately equal amounts as soluble and insoluble enzyme.	1995 Feb	Koller G,Graumann K,Kramer W,Sara M,Jungbauer A	Journal of chromatography.

10681042	Chromatographic purification of the C(H)2 domain of the monoclonal antibody MAK33.	The C(H)2 domain, one of the constant domains of the murine monoclonal antibody MAK33 (immunoglobulin subtype K/IgG1) was expressed in Escherichia coli forming insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs) and purified by a three-step process including a denaturation-renaturation step, hydrophobic interaction and gel permeation chromatography. After disrupting the cells, the soluble protein fraction was removed by several centrifugation steps. The isolation of the IBs from the cell fragments was achieved by solubilizing the IBs with 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmCl) and 0.1 M 1,4-dithioerythrit (DTE) to reduce all disulfide bonds. After refolding the C(H)2 domain, 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4 was added to the protein solution in order to precipitate contaminations. Then the protein was loaded on a Butyl-Sepharose fast flow column and eluted with a linear gradient [1.5-0 M (NH4)2SO4]. As the last purification step a gel permeation chromatography was run on a Superdex 75 prep grade. Finally, the purity of the C(H)2 protein was determined by a silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel. We achieved a typical yield of 0.5 mg pure protein per 1 g of wet cells.	2000 Jan	Thies M J,Pirkl F	Journal of chromatography.

12790657	On-column refolding of recombinant human interferon-gamma with an immobilized chaperone fragment.	The chaperone mini-GroEL is a soluble recombinant fragment containing the 191-345 amino acid sequence of GroEL with a 6xHis tag. The refolding protocol assisted with mini-GroEL was studied for the activity recovery of rhIFN-gamma inclusion bodies. In a suspended system, mini-GroEL showed significant enhancement of the activity recovery of rhIFN-gamma, applyed with a 1-5:1 stoichiometry of mini-GroEL to rhIFN-gamma at 25 degrees C. Moreover, 1 M urea in the renaturation buffer had a synergistic effect on suppressing the aggregation and improving the activity recovery. Finally, a novel chromatographic column, containing 1 cm height of Sephadex G 200 at the top of column and packed with immobilized mini-GroEL to promote refolding, was devised. The total activity recovered per milligram of denatured rhIFN-gamma was up to 3.93 x 10(6) IU with the immobilized mini-GroEL column, which was reused four times without evident loss of renaturation ability. A convenient technique with the integrated process of chaperon preparation and rhIFN-gamma folding in vitro was developed.

10512796	Evaluation of refolding conditions for a recombinant human interleukin-3 variant (daniplestim).	The refolding of daniplestim, a human interleukin-3 variant (SC-55494) from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies, was optimized using a reversed-phase HPLC method developed to permit quantification of the reduced and oxidized forms of daniplestim. The presence of cysteine or dithiothreitol accelerated refolding of daniplestim from E. coli inclusion body slurries dissolved in urea or guanidine solutions and was complete in 4-6 h. Regardless of the dissolution and refolding protocol used to renature daniplestim, equivalently bioactive protein was produced. Under refolding conditions, no covalent modification of daniplestim by cysteine or cyanate was observed. The folding process was characterized further by following the unfolding of purified daniplestim by far-UV CD and fluorescence spectroscopies under both oxidizing and reducing conditions at pH values between 7 and 11. Formation of the single disulphide bond had a large stabilizing effect on daniplestim structure ( approximately 4-5 kCal at pH 9.5). This thermodynamic stabilization drove the refolding process towards the native form, even under conditions where the reduced protein was largely unfolded. From these data, scaleable refolding conditions for daniplestim were established.	1999 Oct	Boyle D M,McKinnie R E,Joy W D,Violand B N,McLaughlin J K,Landis B H	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 30 ( Pt 2) 163-70	Daniplestim (interleukin-3 variant)	ANCSIMIDEIIHHLKRPPNPLLPNNLNSEDMDILMERNLDTPNLLAFVRAVKHLENASGIEAILRNLQPCLPSATAAPSRHPIIIKAGDWQEFREKLTFYLVTLDQAQEQQ		P08700			9	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
8387198	A bacterially expressed single-chain Fv construct from the 2B4 T-cell receptor.	A single-chain Fv construct of the 2B4 T-cell receptor has been made and expressed in Escherichia coli as bacterial inclusion bodies. After solubilization in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and formation of mixed disulfides with glutathione, the protein was refolded by diluting out the denaturant and allowing intramolecular disulfide bridges to form by disulfide exchange. Approximately 65-100 mg of refolded protein was obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture, an appreciable fraction of which was monomeric in nondenaturing solvents. This protein bound to three monoclonal antibodies specific for allotypic or idiotypic determinants on the native 2B4 variable region but did not bind several other anti-T-cell-receptor monoclonal antibodies that lacked such specificity. These experiments show that T-cell-receptor variable regions, like the V regions of antibodies, can form a well-behaved single-chain Fv molecule and provide large amounts of recombinant single-chain Fv T-cell receptor that can be used to study T-cell function.	1993 May	Kurucz I,Jost C R,George A J,Andrew S M,Segal D M	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 90(9) 3830-4	T-cell receptor 2B4 single chain Fv	MGDQVEQSPSALSLHEGTGSALRCNFTTTTMRAVQWFQQNRGSLINLFYLASGTKENGRLKSTFNSKESYSTLHIRDAQLEDSGTYFCAALSGTGGNNKLTFGQGTVLSVIPDIQNPEPAVYQLKDGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSNSKVIQTPRYLVKGQGQKAKMRCIPEKGHPVVFWYQQNKNNEFKFLINFQNQEVLQQIDMTEKRFSAECPSNSPCSLEIQSSEAGDSALYLCASSLNWSQDTQYFGPGTRLLVLEDLRNVTTVSSEQKLISEEDLN	V(alpha) chain-linker-V(beta chain)-Cmyc tagCmyc tag is a 15a.a. residue tag from human myc oncogene	P01734			8	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11904153	Conformational change and destabilization of cataract gammaC-crystallin T5P mutant.	Human lens gammaC-crystallin and T5P mutant were cloned, and their biophysical properties and thermodynamic stability were studied. CRYGC (T5P) is one of the many gamma-crystallin mutant genes for autosomal dominant congenital cataracts. This mutation is associated with Coppock-like cataract, and has the phenotype of a dust-like opacity of the fetal lens nucleus. During cloning and overexpression, the majority of T5P mutant was found in the inclusion body. This property is unique among the many cataract gamma-crystallin mutant genes. It is thus worthwhile to study what factors contribute to this unique property of gammaC-crystallin. One possibility is changes in conformation and stability, which can be studied using spectroscopic measurements. In this study, conformational change was studied by circular dichroism and fluorescence measurements, and conformational stability was determined by thermal unfolding probed by Trp fluorescence and time-dependent light scattering. The T5P mutation obviously changes conformation and decreases conformational stability.	2002 Feb	Fu Ling,Liang Jack J N	FEBS letters. 513(2-3) 213-6	Gamma-crystallin C	MGKIPFYEDRAFQGRSYETTTDCPNLQPYFSRCNSIRVESGCWMLYERPNYQGQQYLLRRGEYPDYQQWMGLSDSIRSCCLIPQTVSHRLRLYEREDHKGLMMELSEDCPSIQDRFHLSEIRSLHVLEGCWVLYELPNYRGRQYLLRPQEYRRCQDWGAMDAKAGSLRRVVDLY	Wild-type protein expressed solubly,C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P07315			7.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
15322283	Biological activity, membrane-targeting modification, and crystallization of soluble human decay accelerating factor expressed in E. coli.	Decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) is a glycophosphatidyl inositol-anchored glycoprotein that regulates the activity of C3 and C5 convertases. In addition to understanding the mechanism of complement inhibition by DAF through structural studies, there is also an interest in the possible therapeutic potential of the molecule. In this report we describe the cloning, expression in Escherichia coli, isolation and membrane-targeting modification of the four short consensus repeat domains of soluble human DAF with an additional C-terminal cysteine residue to permit site-specific modification. The purified refolded recombinant protein was active against both classical and alternative pathway assays of complement activation and had similar biological activity to soluble human DAF expressed in Pichia pastoris. Modification with a membrane-localizing peptide restored cell binding and gave a large increase in antihemolytic potency. These data suggested that the recombinant DAF was correctly folded and suitable for structural studies as well as being the basis for a DAF-derived therapeutic. Crystals of the E. coli-derived protein were obtained and diffracted to 2.2 A, thus permitting the first detailed X-ray crystallography studies on a functionally active human complement regulator protein with direct therapeutic potential.	2004 Sep	White Jennifer,Lukacik Petra,Esser Dirk,Steward Michael,Giddings Naomi,Bright Jeremy R,Fritchley Sarah J,Morgan B Paul,Lea Susan M,Smith Geoffrey P,Smith Richard A G	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 13(9) 2406-15	Decay accelerating factor (CD55)	MTVARPSVPAALPLLGELPRLLLLVLLCLPAVWGDCGLPPDVPNAQPALEGRTSFPEDTVITYKCEESFVKIPGEKDSVICLKGSQWSDIEEFCNRSCEVPTRLNSASLKQPYITQNYFPVGTVVEYECRPGYRREPSLSPKLTCLQNLKWSTAVEFCKKKSCPNPGEIRNGQIDVPGGILFGATISFSCNTGYKLFGSTSSFCLISGSSVQWSDPLPECREIYCPAPPQIDNGIIQGERDHYGYRQSVTYACNKGFTMIGEHSIYCTVNNDEGEWSGPPPECRGKSLTSKVPPTVQKPTTVNVPTTEVSPTSQKTTTKTTTPNAQATRSTPVSRTTKHFHETTPNKGSGTTSGTTRLLSGHTCFTLTGLLGTLVTMGLLT		P08174			11	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12011004	Purification, characterization, and immunogenicity of the refolded ectodomain of the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 expressed in Escherichia coli.	The apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) has emerged as a promising vaccine candidate against malaria. Advanced evaluation of its protective efficacy in humans requires the production of highly purified and correctly folded protein. We describe here a process for the expression, fermentation, refolding, and purification of the recombinant ectodomain of AMA1 (amino acids 83(Gly) to 531(Glu)) of Plasmodium falciparum (3D7) produced in Escherichia coli. A synthetic gene containing an E. coli codon bias was cloned into a modified pET32 plasmid, and the recombinant protein was produced by using a redox-modified E. coli strain, Origami (DE3). A purification process was developed that included Sarkosyl extraction followed by affinity purification on a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The recombinant AMA1 was refolded in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione and further purified by using two ion-exchange chromatographic steps. The final product, designated AMA1/E, was homogeneous, monomeric, and &gt;99d0c850ure and had low endotoxin content and low host cell contamination. Analysis of AMA1/E showed that it had the predicted primary sequence, and tertiary structure analysis confirmed its compact disulfide-bonded nature. Rabbit antibodies made to the protein recognized the native parasite AMA1 and inhibited the growth of the P. falciparum homologous 3D7 clone in an in vitro assay. Reduction-sensitive epitopes on AMA1/E were shown to be necessary for the production of inhibitory anti-AMA1 antibodies. AMA1/E was recognized by a conformation-dependent, growth-inhibitory monoclonal antibody, 4G2dc1. The process described here was successfully scaled up to produce AMA1/E protein under GMP conditions, and the product was found to induce highly inhibitory antibodies in rabbits.	2002 Jun	Dutta Sheetij,Lalitha P V,Ware Lisa A,Barbosa Arnoldo,Moch J Kathleen,Vassell Meredith A,Fileta Bader B,Kitov Svetlana,Kolodny Nelly,Heppner D Gray,Haynes J David,Lanar David E	Infection and immunity. 70(6) 3101-10	Apical membrane antigen 1	MAHHHHHHPGGSGSGTMHGAEPAPQEQNLFSSIEIV100ERSNYMGNPWTEYMAKYDIEEVHGSGIRVDLGEDAEVAGTQYRLPSGKCPVFGKGIIIENSNTTFLTPVATGNQYLKDGGFAFPPTEPLMSPMTLDEMRHFYKDNKYVKNLDELTLCSRHAGNMIPDNDKNSNYKYPAVYDDKDKKCHILYIAAQENNGPRYCNKDESKRNSMFCFRPAKDISFQNYTYLSKNVVDNWEKVCPRKNLQNAKFGLWVDGNCEDIPHVNEFPAIDLFECNKLVFELSASDQPKQYEQHLTDYEKIKEGFKNKNASMIKSAFLPTGAFKADRYKSHGKGYNWGNYNTETQKCEIFNVKPTCLINNSSYIATTALSHPIEVENNFPCSLYKDEIMKEIERESKRIKLNDNDDEGNKKIIAPRIFISDDKDSLKCPCDPEMVSNSTCRFFVCKCVERRAEVTSNNEVVVKEEYKDEAAALEHHHHHH	N-terminal and C-terminal poly-histidine tags	Q7KQK5		3 subdomains of main ectodomain, aa.83-531	8	22	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

We have over-expressed recombinant growth hormones from the fish ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) and yellow grouper (Epinephelus awoara) by a pET expression system. Both recombinant proteins accumulate as insoluble form in Escherichia coli.

12071705	Expression, refolding, purification, molecular characterization, crystallization, and preliminary X-ray analysis of the receptor binding domain of human B7-2.	The cell-mediated immune response involves a series of specific molecular interactions between cell surface molecules on T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Of particular importance for the regulation of T cell activity is the interaction of the B7 isoforms, B7-1 and B7-2, with the T cell surface costimulatory receptors, CD28 and CTLA-4. The binding of CD28 by B7-1/B7-2 results in an enhancement of T cell responses initiated by the interaction between a clonotypic T cell receptor and its specific, antigenic MHC-peptide complex, whereas the subsequent engagement of CTLA-4 by B7-1/B7-2 leads to a down-regulation of the response. Here we report the expression, refolding, purification, characterization, and crystallization of the receptor-binding domain of human B7-2. The receptor-binding domain of human B7-2 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, solubilized in 6 M guanidine-hydrochloride, and then refolded in vitro by rapid dilution into a renaturing buffer. Refolded B7-2 was subsequently purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography. Gel-filtration chromatography and native PAGE analysis showed that the receptor-binding domain of B7-2 is exclusively monomeric in solution. Purified B7-2 binds tightly to bacterially expressed monomeric and disulfide-linked homodimeric human CTLA-4 as shown by gel-filtration chromatography and native PAGE. This suggests that glycosylation is not important for the proper folding of the receptor-binding domain of B7-2 nor for its binding to CTLA-4. In addition, these results suggest that refolded B7-2 is biologically active and may be a useful therapeutic and experimental reagent for regulating T cell activity. Refolded and purified B7-2 was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, allowing for the initiation of an X-ray crystallographic study.	2002 Jun	Zhang Xuewu,Schwartz Jean-Claude D,Almo Steven C,Nathenson Stanley G	Protein expression and purification. 25(1) 105-13	T lymphocyte activation antigen CD86/B7-antigen	MLKIQAYFNETADLPCQFANSQNQSLSELVVFWQDQENLVLNEVYLGKEKFDSVHSKYMGRTSFDSDSWTLRLHNLQIKDKGLYQCIIHHKKPTGMIRIHQMNSELSVLA		P42081		V-type Ig (receptor binding) domain, aa.1-109	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

12297282	Antitumor activity of interleukin-21 prepared by novel refolding procedure from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli.	Interleukin-21 (IL-21) has recently been identified as a novel 4-helix-bundle type I cytokine possessing a cytokine receptor gamma chain essential for the immune response. We report the preparation and functional characterization of Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant human IL-21 (rIL-21). The rIL-21, expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli, was solubilized and then refolded by using a modified dialysis method. The introduction of redox reagents during refolding led to a dramatic increase in the refolding efficiency. Circular dichroism spectrum analysis showed that the refolded rIL-21 had an alpha-helix as a secondary structure, which is a characteristic of type I cytokines. Flow cytometry confirmed previous reports that rIL-21 binds to CD3-activated T cells (T-LAK) and to cell lines Raji, HL60, and Jurkat. rIL-21 stimulated the proliferation of T-LAK but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and this effect seems to be identical to that of co-stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody. Growth inhibition assay indicated that enhancement of the cytotoxicity of T-LAK to the human bile duct carcinoma TFK-1 depended on the concentration of rIL-21. Thus, refolded rIL-21 had activity identical to that of authentic IL-21 and enhanced the anti-tumor activity of T-LAK. These conclusions suggest the potential use of the refolded cytokine in adoptive immunotherapy using T-LAK cells and in the discovery of other functions of the cytokine.	2002 Sep	Asano Ryutaro,Kudo Toshio,Makabe Koki,Tsumoto Kouhei,Kumagai Izumi	FEBS letters. 528(1-3) 70-6	Interleukin-21	MAQDRHMIRMRQLIDIVDQLKNYVNDLVPEFLPAPEDVETNCEWSAFSCFQKAQLKSANTGNNERIINVSIKKLKRKPPSTNAGRRQKHRLTCPSCDSYEKKPPKEFLERFKSLLQKMIHQHLSSRTHGSED		Q9HBE4			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15158718	Molecular cloning, functional expression in Escherichia coli and enzymatic characterisation of a cysteine protease from white clover (Trifolium repens).	This paper presents the cloning and biochemical characterisation of the cysteine protease Tr-cp 14 from white clover (Trifolium repens). The predicted amino acid sequence of Tr-cp 14 is 71%, 74% and 74 0dentical to the cysteine proteases XCP1 and XCP2 from Arabidopsis thaliana, and p48h-17 from Zinnia elegans, respectively. These cysteine proteases have previously been shown to be involved in programmed cell death during tracheary element differentiation. The precursor polypeptide of Tr-cp 14 was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified from inclusion bodies and refolded. The precursor polypeptide could be processed to its active mature form autocatalytically at pH 5.0 and had a requirement for 20 mM l-cysteine for optimal activity. Mature Tr-cp 14 showed a preference for synthetic aminomethylcoumarin substrates with either Leu or Phe in the P2 position when tested with Arg in P1. A substrate with Arg in both the P1 and P2 position was not accepted as substrate.	2004 Jun	Asp Torben,Bowra Steve,Borg Søren,Holm Preben Bach	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1699(1-2) 111-22	Cysteine protease 14	MASMTGGQQMGRGSRDFSIVGYSSEDLKSMDKLIELFESWMSRHGKIYETIEEKLLRFEVFKDNLKHIDERNKIVSNYWLGLNEFADLSHQEFKNKYLGLKVNLSQRRESSNEEEFTYRDVDLPKSVDWRKKGAVTPVKNQGQCGSCWAFSTVAAVEGINQIVTGNLTSLSEQELIDCDTTYNNGCNGGLMDYAFSFIVQNGGLHKEDDYPYIMEESTCEMKKEETQVVTINGYHDVPQNNEQSLLKALANQPLSVAIEASSRDFQFYSGGVFDGHCGSDLDHGVSAVGYGTSKNLDYIIVKNSWGAKWGEKGFIRMKRNIGKPEGICGLYKMASYPTKKKKLAAALEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q6Y1E9			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12737851	Humanized docking system for assembly of targeting drug delivery complexes.	Targeted drug delivery requires &#39;loading&#39; drugs onto targeting proteins.

We describe here a fully humanized adapter/docking tag system based on non-covalent interaction between two fragments of human pancreatic RNase I. A 15 amino acid long N-terminal fragment of RNase I designed to serve as a docking tag, was fused to the N-terminus of human vascular endothelial growth factor that served as a targeting protein. An 18-125 and an 18-127 amino acid long fragments of RNase I were engineered, expressed and refolded into active conformations to serve as adapter proteins. Interactions between the targeting and adapter proteins were characterized using enzymatic analysis and surface plasmon resonance. Targeting DNA delivery complexes were assembled, characterized by dynamic light scattering, and found to be very effective in receptor-mediated DNA delivery.	2003 May	Backer Marina V,Gaynutdinov Timur I,Gorshkova Inna I,Crouch Robert J,Hu Tao,Aloise Renee,Arab Mohamed,Przekop Kristen,Backer Joseph M	Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society. 89(3) 499-511	Vascular endothelial growth factor	KESRAKKFQRQHMDSGTLVPRGSMEGGKSKNDVIPFMDVYKKSACKTRELLVDIIQEYPDEIEHTYIPSCVVLMRCAGCCNDEALECVPTETRNVTMEVLRVKQRVSQHNFQLSFTEHTKCECRPKAEVKAKKERCEKPR	N-terminal S-tag	P15692			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2684978	Activity and deletion analysis of recombinant human cathepsin L expressed in Escherichia coli.	A cDNA clone encoding the human cysteine protease cathepsin L was expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli in a T7 expression system. The insoluble recombinant enzyme was solubilized in urea and refolded at alkaline pH. 38-kDa procathepsin L was purified by gel filtration at pH 8.0, and a 29-kDa form of the enzyme was purified by gel filtration after autoprocessing of the proenzyme at pH 6.5. The kinetic properties of the 29-kDa species of recombinant cathepsin L were similar to those published for the human liver enzyme (Mason, R. W., Green, G. D. J., and Barrett, A.J. (1985) Biochem. J. 226, 233-241), using benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-(4-methyl)coumarylamide as substrate. However, the stability of the recombinant enzyme, and its pH optimum for this substrate was shifted to a higher pH. Structure-function studies of cathepsin L were performed by constructing mutations in either the propeptide portion or the carboxyl-terminal light chain portion of the protein. These constructions were expressed in the E. coli system, and enzymatic activities were assayed following solubilization, renaturation, and gel filtration chromatography of the mutated proteins. Deletions of increasing size in the propeptide resulted in large proportional losses of activity, indicating that the propeptide is essential for proper enzyme folding and/or processing in this renaturation system. Deletion of part of the light chain containing a disulfide-forming cysteine residue or a single amino acid substitution of alanine for this cysteine residue resulted in almost complete loss of activity. These data suggest that the disulfide bond joining the heavy and light chains of cathepsin L is essential for enzymatic activity.	1989 Dec	Smith S M,Gottesman M M	The Journal of biological chemistry. 264(34) 20487-95	Procathepsin L	TKWKAMHNRLYGMNEEGWRRAVWEKNMKMIELHNQEYREGKHSFTMAMNAFGDMTSEEFRQVMNGFQNRKPRKGKVFQEPLFYEAPRSVDWREKGYVTPVKNQGQCGSCWAFSATGALEGQMFRKTGRLISLSEQNLVDCSGPQGNEGCNGGLMDYAFQYVQDNGGLDSEESYPYEATEESCKYNPKYSVANDTGFVDIPKQEKALMKAVATVGPISVAIDAGHESFLFYKEGIYFEPDCSSEDMDHGVLVVGYGFESTESDNNKYWLVKNSWGEEWGMGGYVKMAKDRRNHCGIASAASYPTV	Different constructs refolded:Full protein CtsLNdelta29 (except -12 aa or Pro region)Sequence: (NB.does not include 11 N-terminal a.a. of T7 gene 10 fusion plus 3aa.linker)T KWKAMHNRLY GMNEEGWRRA  50VWEKNMKMIE LHNQEYREGK HSFTMAMNAF GDMTSEEFRQ VMNGFQNRKP 100RKGKVFQEPL FYEAPRSVDW REKGYVTPVK NQGQCGSCWA FSATGALEGQ 150MFRKTGRLIS LSEQNLVDCS GPQGNEGCNG GLMDYAFQYV QDNGGLDSEE 200SYPYEATEES CKYNPKYSVA NDTGFVDIPK QEKALMKAVA TVGPISVAID 250AGHESFLFYK EGIYFEPDCS SEDMDHGVLV VGYGFESTES DNNKYWLVKN 300SWGEEWGMGG YVKMAKDRRN HCGIASAASY PTVNumber of amino acids: 304Molecular weight: 34446.5Theoretical pI: 5.42CtsLNdelta87: -80aa. from pro-region(excluding 11 N-terminal a.a. of T7 gene 10 fusion plus 3aa.linker)RKPRKGKVFQEPL FYEAPRSVDW REKGYVTPVK NQGQCGSCWA FSATGALEGQMFRKTGRLIS LSEQNLVDCS GPQGNEGCNG GLMDYAFQYV QDNGGLDSEE 200SYPYEATEES CKYNPKYSVA NDTGFVDIPK QEKALMKAVA TVGPISVAID 250AGHESFLFYK EGIYFEPDCS SEDMDHGVLV VGYGFESTES DNNKYWLVKN 300SWGEEWGMGG YVKMAKDRRN HCGIASAASY PTVNumber of amino acids: 236Molecular weight: 26174.1Theoretical pI: 4.95CtsLNdelta115: No pro-sequence, -2aa. from mature protein(excluding 11 N-terminal a.a. of T7 gene 10 fusion plus 2aa.linker)RSVDW REKGYVTPVK NQGQCGSCWA FSATGALEGQ 150MFRKTGRLIS LSEQNLVDCS GPQGNEGCNG GLMDYAFQYV QDNGGLDSEE 200SYPYEATEES CKYNPKYSVA NDTGFVDIPK QEKALMKAVA TVGPISVAID 250AGHESFLFYK EGIYFEPDCS SEDMDHGVLV VGYGFESTES DNNKYWLVKN 300SWGEEWGMGG YVKMAKDRRN HCGIASAASY PTVNumber of amino acids: 218Molecular weight: 24001.5Theoretical pI: 4.68CtsLCdelta22: -12 aa from pro-sequence, -22aa from C-terminus, with an extra lysine at the end(excluding 11 N-terminal aa of T7 gene 10 fusion plus 3aa.linker)T KWKAMHNRLY GMNEEGWRRA  50VWEKNMKMIE LHNQEYREGK HSFTMAMNAF GDMTSEEFRQ VMNGFQNRKP 100RKGKVFQEPL FYEAPRSVDW REKGYVTPVK NQGQCGSCWA FSATGALEGQ 150MFRKTGRLIS LSEQNLVDCS GPQGNEGCNG GLMDYAFQYV QDNGGLDSEE 200SYPYEATEES CKYNPKYSVA NDTGFVDIPK QEKALMKAVA TVGPISVAID 250AGHESFLFYK EGIYFEPDCS SEDMDHGVLV VGYGFESTES DNNKYWLVKN 300SWGEEWGMGG YKNumber of amino acids: 283Molecular weight: 32216.9Theoretical pI: 5.15CtsLCC&gt;A: -12aa of pro-sequence, C332A mutation(excluding 11 N-terminal aa of T7 gene 10 fusion plus 3aa.linker)T KWKAMHNRLY GMNEEGWRRA  50VWEKNMKMIE LHNQEYREGK HSFTMAMNAF GDMTSEEFRQ VMNGFQNRKP 100RKGKVFQEPL FYEAPRSVDW REKGYVTPVK NQGQCGSCWA FSATGALEGQ 150MFRKTGRLIS LSEQNLVDCS GPQGNEGCNG GLMDYAFQYV QDNGGLDSEE 200SYPYEATEES CKYNPKYSVA NDTGFVDIPK QEKALMKAVA TVGPISVAID 250AGHESFLFYK EGIYFEPDCS SEDMDHGVLV VGYGFESTES DNNKYWLVKN 300SWGEEWGMGG YVKMAKDRRN HAGIASAASY PTVNumber of amino acids: 304Molecular weight: 34414.4Theoretical pI: 5.42	P07711			10.7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11292751	Specificity of the protective antibody response to apical membrane antigen 1.	Apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is considered one of the leading candidates for inclusion in a vaccine against blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum. Although the ama1 gene is relatively conserved compared to those for some other potential vaccine components, numerous point mutations have resulted in amino acid substitutions at many sites in the polypeptide. The polymorphisms in AMA1 have been attributed to the diversifying selection pressure of the protective immune responses. It was therefore of interest to investigate the impact of sequence diversity in P. falciparum AMA1 on the ability of anti-AMA1 antibodies to inhibit the invasion of erythrocytes in vitro by P. falciparum merozoites. For these studies, we used antibodies to recombinant P. falciparum 3D7 AMA1 ectodomain, which was prepared for testing in early clinical trials. Antibodies were raised in rabbits to the antigen formulated in Montanide ISA720, and human antibodies to AMA1 were isolated by affinity purification from the plasma of adults living in regions of Papua New Guinea where malaria is endemic. Both rabbit and human anti-AMA1 antibodies were found to be strongly inhibitory to the invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites from both the homologous and two heterologous lines of P. falciparum. The inhibitory antibodies targeted both conserved and strain-specific epitopes within the ectodomain of AMA1; however, it appears that the majority of these antibodies reacted with strain-specific epitopes in domain I, the N-terminal disulfide-bonded domain, which is the most polymorphic region of AMA1.	2001 May	Hodder A N,Crewther P E,Anders R F	Infection and immunity. 69(5) 3286-94	Apical membrane antigen 1	HHHHHHMRKLYCVLLLSAFEFTYMINFGRGQNYWEHPYQNSNVYHPINEHREHPKKYEYPLHQEHTYQQEDSGEDENTLQHAYPIDHEGAEPAPQEQNLFSSIEIVERSNYMGNPWTEYMAKYDIEEVHGSGIRVDLGEDAEVAGTQYRLPSGKCPVFGKGIIIENSNTTFLTPVATGNQDLKDGGFAFPPTNPPMSPMTLNGMRDLYKNNEYVKNLDELTLCSRHAGNMNPDNDENSNYKYPAVYDDKDKKCHILYIAAQENNGPRYCNKDESKRNSMFCFRPAKDKSFQNYTYLSKNVVDNWEEVCPRKNLENAKFGLWVDGNCEDIPHVNEFSANDLFECNKLVFELSASDQPKQYEQHLTDYEKIKEGFKNKNASMIKSAFLPTGAFKADRYKSHGRGYNWGNYNRKTQKCEIFNVKPTCLINNSSYIATTALSHPIEVEHNFPCSLYKDEIKKEIERESKRIKLNDNDDEGNKKIIAPRIFISDDIDSLKCPCAPEIVSNSTCNFFVCKCVEKRAEVTSNNEVVVKEEYKDEYADIPEHKPTYDKMKIIIASSAAVAVLATILMVYLYKRKGNAEKYDKMDEPQHYGKSNSRNDEMLDPEASFWGEEKRASHTTPVLMEKPYY	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O00784			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9607037	Immunisation with recombinant AMA-1 protects mice against infection with Plasmodium chabaudi.	The Plasmodium merozoite surface antigen apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) has previously been shown to provide partial protection to Saimiri and rhesus monkeys immunised with recombinant Plasmodium fragile or parasite-derived Plasmodium knowlesi AMA-1, respectively. In the study reported here we have used the Plasmodium chabaudi/mouse model system to extend our pre-clinical assessment of an AMA-1 vaccine. We describe here the expression of the full-length Plasmodium chabaudi adami AMA-1 and the P. chabaudi adami AMA-1 ectodomain using both baculovirus and Escherichia coli. The ectodomain expressed in E. coli, which contained an N-terminal hexa-his tag, was purified by Ni-chelate chromatography and refolded in vitro in the presence of oxidised and reduced glutathione to generate intramolecular disulphide bonds. In a series of vaccine trials, in both inbred and outbred mice, highly significant protection was obtained by immunising with the refolded AMA-1 ectodomain. Protection was shown to correlate with antibody response and was dependent on intact disulphide bonds. Passive transfer of antibodies raised in rabbits against the refolded AMA-1 ectodomain was also protective. In view of this demonstration that E. coli expression of a soluble P. chabaudi AMA-1 domain can generate a vaccine that is effective in mice, we are pursuing a similar approach to generating a vaccine against P. falciparum for testing in human volunteers.

12351833	Crystallization and preliminary crystallographic characterization of the extracellular Ig-like domain of human natural killer cell activating receptor NKp44.	The cytolytic activity of human natural killer (NK) cells is regulated by fine balancing between activating and inhibitory signals related to distinct families of inhibitory and triggering receptor molecules. The recent identification of NKp44, a triggering receptor selectively expressed by activated NK cells and playing an important role in the natural cytotoxicity of these cells, opens the way to the characterization of the mechanisms involved in NKp44-mediated NK-cell activation on a structural basis. For this purpose, the NKp44 extracellular Ig-like domain was cloned, overexpressed, refolded and crystallized. Diffraction intensities were collected to a resolution limit of 2.2 A on a synchrotron source. NKp44 extracellular Ig-like domain crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6(2)22 (or P6(4)22), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 60.4, c = 197.2 A, gamma = 120 degrees.

11035957	Development of a recombinant bacterial expression system for the active form of a human transforming growth factor beta type II receptor ligand binding domain.	Expression systems have been designed to test the suitability of expressing the high cysteine containing extracellular domain (residues 1-136) of human transforming growth factor beta type II receptor (TbetaRII). Receptor expressed using a baculovirus system was functional following both enzymatic deglycosylation and elimination of the N-terminal 22 amino acids by protease degradation. Bacterial expression of a TbetaRII lacking the 26 N-terminal amino acids retained the ability to bind its ligand, TGF-beta1. Receptor expressed in bacteria was sensitive to proteolytic degradation at residue Lys98 but a K98T mutation eliminated degradation and did not disrupt binding. Although several different forms of TbetaRII were expressed, only a fusion with glutathione S-transferase gave soluble TbetaRII, which was purified at a yield of 0.1 mg/10 L of bacterial growth. N-Terminal truncations of TbetaRII (residues 22-136 or 27-136) could be refolded from inclusion bodies and purified to an active form with an efficiency of 10%.	2000 Oct	Boesen C C,Motyka S A,Patamawenu A,Sun P D	Protein expression and purification. 20(1) 98-104	TGF-beta receptor type II	mgsshhhhhhssglvprgsTDNNGAVKFPQLCKFCDVRFSTCDNQKSCMSNCSITSICEKPQEVCVAVWRKNDENITLETVCHDPKLPYHDFILEDAASPKCIMKEKKKPGETFFMCSCSSDECNDNIIFSEEYNTSNP	Two other constructs also expressed and refolded aa.22-136, aa.27-13622-136:A KFPQL CKFCDVRFST CDNQKSCMSN CSITSICEKP QEVCVAVWRK NDENITLETV CHDPKLPYHD FILEDAASPK CIMKEKKKPG ETFFMCSCSS DECNDNIIFS EEYNTSNPNumber of amino acids: 114Molecular weight: 13023.8Theoretical pI: 4.9827-136 (pET30a)ACKFCDVRFST CDNQKSCMSN CSITSICEKP QEVCVAVWRK NDENITLETV CHDPKLPYHD FILEDAASPK CIMKEKKKPG ETFFMCSCSS DECNDNIIFS EEYNTSNPNumber of amino acids: 109Molecular weight: 12410.0Theoretical pI: 4.83,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P37173			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

The N-terminal, extracellular domain of the receptor for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1 receptor) was expressed at a high level in E. coli and isolated as inclusion bodies. Renaturation with concomitant disulfide bond formation was achieved from guanidinium-solubilized material. A soluble and active fraction of the protein was isolated by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. Complex formation with GLP-1 was shown by cross-linking experiments, surface plasmon resonance measurements, and isothermal titration calorimetry. The existence of disulfide bridges in the N-terminal receptor fragment was proven after digestion of the protein with pepsin. Further analysis revealed a disulfide-binding pattern with links between cysteines 46 and 71, 62 and 104, and between 85 and 126.	2002 May	Bazarsuren Ariuna,Grauschopf Ulla,Wozny Manfred,Reusch Dietmar,Hoffmann Eike,Schaefer Wolfgang,Panzner Steffen,Rudolph Rainer	Biophysical chemistry. 96(2-3) 305-18	Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor	MRGSHHHHHHGSAGPRPQGATVSLWETVQKWREYRRQCQRSLTEDPPPATDLFCNRTFDEYACWPDGEPGSFVNVSCPWYLPWASSVPQGHVYRFCTAEGLWLQKDNSSLPWRDLSECEESKRGERSSPEEQLLFLYGRKRKRKRKN	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P43220		N-terminal Extracellular domain aa.1-125	8.5	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10497065	Refolding and characterization of recombinant human soluble CTLA-4 expressed in Escherichia coli.	CD28 and CTLA-4 are homologous cell surface proteins expressed by T cells. CD28 is constitutively expressed by most T cells, whereas CTLA-4 is expressed by activated T cells. Both proteins are ligands for the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 expressed by activated B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. A fusion protein comprising the CTLA-4 extracellular domain joined to a human immunoglobulin heavy chain constant region (CTLA4Ig) binds CD80 and CD-86 with high affinity and inhibits CD80/CD86-dependent immune responses in vitro and in vivo. Attempts at producing the CTLA-4 extracellular domain as an unfused protein have met with limited success. Here we describe the expression and purification of the CTLA-4 extracellular domain as a nonfused protein in Escherichia coli. The 12.5-kDa CTLA-4 extracellular domain was insoluble when expressed in E. coli and required denaturation, reduction, and refolding steps to become soluble and assume its proper conformation. The protein refolded into a mixture of monomers, disulfide-linked dimers, and higher order disulfide-linked aggregates. sCTLA-4 dimers were the predominant refold form when air was used as the oxidizing agent during the refold procedure. Purified sCTLA-4 dimers were 10- to 50-fold more potent than sCTLA-4 monomers at inhibiting T cell activation using a CD80-dependent in vitro bioassay.	1999 Oct	Cox G N,Pratt D,Smith D,McDermott M J,Vanderslice R W	Protein expression and purification. 17(1) 26-32	Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte protein 4	AMHVAQPAVVLASSRGIASFVCEYASPGKATEVRVTVLRQADSQVTEVCAATYMMGNELTFLDDSICTGTSSGNQVNLTIQGLRAMDTGLYICKVELMYPPPYYLGIGNGTQIYVIDPEPCPDSD		P16410		Extracellular domain aa.1-125	9.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
10497083	Production of engineered human pancreatic ribonucleases, solving expression and purification problems, and enhancing thermostability.	Human pancreatic ribonuclease, the homolog of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease, has a significant therapeutic potential. Its study has been hindered by the difficulty of obtaining the enzyme in a pure and homogeneous form, either from human source or using heterologous expression. Engineering of different variants of human pancreatic ribonuclease has allowed us to study and overcome some problems encountered during its heterologous production in an Escherichia coli system and its purification from inclusion bodies. The 5&#39;-end region of the mRNA that encodes the enzyme is critical for obtaining high expression levels. The results also suggest the importance of the proline 50 residue in the recovery yields of human pancreatic ribonuclease. All the variants produced are pure and homogeneous. Their homogeneity has been demonstrated by cation-exchange and reversed-phase chromatography and by mass spectrometry analysis. Moreover, enhancement of human pancreatic ribonuclease thermal stability is observed when residues R4, K6, Q9, D16, and S17 are changed to the corresponding residues of bovine seminal ribonuclease.	1999 Oct	Canals A,Ribó M,Benito A,Bosch M,Mombelli E,Vilanova M	Protein expression and purification. 17(1) 169-81	Ribonuclease A	MESRAKKFQRQHMDSDSSPSSSSTYCNQMMRRRNMTQGRCKPVNTFVHEPLVDVQNVCFQEKVTCKNGQGNCYKSNSSMHITDCRLTNGSRYPNCAYRTSPKERHIIVACEGSPYVPVHFDASVEDST		P07998			8.5	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
12460770	Engineering S-protein fragments of bovine ribonuclease A for targeted drug delivery.	High affinity interaction between S-protein and S-peptide fragments of bovine pancreatic RNase A has been recently used for construction of molecular vehicles for targeted drug delivery. The vehicle is assembled as a complex of drug carrier conjugated S-protein with S-peptide-tagged targeting protein. To avoid random chemical crosslinking of drug carriers to S-protein, we constructed a mutant 16-124aa fragment of RNase A in which 122ala is replaced with a cysteine residue. The mutant and the corresponding wild type fragments expressed in Escherichia coli are refolded into functional conformations only in the presence of S-peptide. After the removal of S-peptide, both fragments retain the ability to bind S-peptide and S-peptide-tagged proteins. The 122cys residue in the mutant fragment is available for site-specific conjugation.	2002 Dec	Backer Marina V,Gaynutdinov Timur I,Aloise Renee,Przekop Kristen,Backer Joseph M	Protein expression and purification. 26(3) 455-61	Ribonuclease A	STSAASSSNYCNQMMKSRNLTKDRCKPVNTFVHESLADVQAVCSQKNVACKNGQTNCYQSYSTMSITDCRETGSSKYPNCAYKTTQANKHIIVACEGNPYVPVHFDASV		P61823		Subtilisin digestion-based fragment aa.16-124	8.6	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11483014	Large-scale preparation of recombinant ovine prolactin and determination of its in vitro and in vivo activity.	Recombinant bovine Ala-prolactin (PRL) (GenBank Accession No. V00112) in prokaryotic expression plasmid pMON3401 was mutated using a mutagenesis kit, to prepare plasmid encoding ovine PRL (oPRL) (GenBank Accession No. M27057) Escherichia coli cells transformed with this latter plasmid overexpressed large amounts of oPRL upon induction with nalidixic acid. The expressed protein, found in inclusion bodies, was refolded and purified to homogeneity on a Q-Sepharose column, yielding an electrophoretically pure fraction composed of over 98% monomeric protein of the expected molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa. The biological activity of the recombinant oPRL after proper renaturation was evidenced in vitro by its ability to stimulate proliferation of rat lymphoma Nb(2) cells possessing PRL receptors, to stimulate luciferase activity in HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with oPRL receptors, and to induce progesterone secretion in primary cultures of luteal cells obtained from midpregnant ewes. In contrast to ovine growth hormone or ovine placental lactogen, recombinant oPRL had no galactopoietic effect in lactating ewes.	2001 Aug	Leibovich H,Raver N,Herman A,Gregoraszczuk E L,Gootwine E,Gertler A	Protein expression and purification. 22(3) 489-96	Prolactin	MDSKGSAQKGSRLLLLLVVSNLLLCQGVVSTPVCPNGPGNCQVSLRDLFDRAVMVSHYIHNLSSEMFNEFDKRYAQGKGFITMALNSCHTSSLPTPEDKEQAQQTHHEVLMSLILGLLRSWNDPLYHLVTEVRGMKGVPDAILSRAIEIEEENKRLLEGMEMIFGQVIPGAKETEPYPVWSGLPSLQTKDEDARHSAFYNLLHCLRRDSSKIDTYLKLLNCRIIYNNNC		P01240			9	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14640960	Expression and refolding of tobacco anionic peroxidase from E. coli inclusion bodies.	Coding DNA of the tobacco anionic peroxidase gene was cloned in pET40b vector. The problem of 11 arginine codons, rare in procaryotes, in the tobacco peroxidase gene was solved using E. coli BL21(DE3) Codon Plus strain. The expression level of the tobacco apo-peroxidase in the above strain was approximately 400f the total E. coli protein. The tobacco peroxidase refolding was optimized based on the earlier developed protocol for horseradish peroxidase. The reactivation yield of recombinant tobacco enzyme was about 7% with the specific activity of 1100-1200 U/mg towards 2,2;-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS). It was shown that the reaction of ABTS oxidation by hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by recombinant tobacco peroxidase proceeds via the ping-pong kinetic mechanism as for the native enzyme. In the presence of calcium ions, the recombinant peroxidase exhibits a 2.5-fold decrease in the second order rate constant for hydrogen peroxide and 1.5-fold decrease for ABTS. Thus, calcium ions have an inhibitory effect on the recombinant enzyme like that observed earlier for the native tobacco peroxidase. The data demonstrate that the oligosaccharide part of the enzyme has no effect on the kinetic properties and calcium inhibition of tobacco peroxidase.	2003 Nov	Hushpulian D M,Savitski P A,Rojkova A M,Chubar T A,Fechina V A,Sakharov I Yu,Lagrimini L M,Tishkov V I,Gazaryan I G	Biochemistry.

15388859	High-pressure refolding of bikunin: efficacy and thermodynamics.	Bikunin is a glycosylated protein that aggregates extensively during mammalian cell culture, resulting in loss of activity, loss of native secondary structure, and the formation of nonnative disulfide bonds. We investigated the use of high hydrostatic pressure (1000-3000 bar) for the refolding of bikunin aggregates. The refolding yield obtained with pressure-modulated refolding at 2000 bar was 70 (+/-5%) by reverse-phase chromatography (RP-HPLC), significantly higher than the value of 55 (+/-6%) (RP-HPLC) obtained with traditional guanidine HCl &quot;dilution-refolding.&quot; In addition, we determined the thermodynamics of pressure-modulated refolding. The change in volume for the transition of aggregate to monomer DeltaV(refolding) was calculated to be -28 (+/-5) mL/mole. Refolding was accompanied by a loss of hydrophobic exposure, resulting in a positive contribution to the DeltaV(refolding). These findings suggest that the disruption of electro-static interactions or the differences in size of solvent-free cavities between the aggregate and the monomer are the prevailing contributions to the negative DeltaV(refolding).	2004 Oct	Seefeldt Matthew B,Ouyang Jun,Froland Wayne A,Carpenter John F,Randolph Theodore W	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 13(10) 2639-50	Human Placental Bikunin	ADRERSIHDFCLVSKVVGRCRASMPRWWYNVTDGSCQLFVYGGCDGNSNNYLTKEECLKKCATVTENATGDLATSRNAADSSVPSAPRRQDSEDHSSDMFNYEEYCTANAVTGPCRASFPRWYFDVERNSCNNFIYGGCRGNKNSYRSEEACMLRCFRQQENPPLPLGSKVVVLAGLFVMVLILFLGASMVYLIRVARRNQERALRTVWSSGDDKEQLVKNTYVL		O43291			8	25	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11591710	High pressure refolding of recombinant human growth hormone from insoluble aggregates. Structural transformations, kinetic barriers, and energetics.	Two different types of insoluble, non-native aggregates of recombinant human growth hormone were formed by agitation in buffer or buffer containing 0.75 m guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) and characterized by infrared and second derivative UV spectroscopies. The degree of secondary structural perturbation was greater in the aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl. Both aggregate types were dissolved and refolded using high hydrostatic pressures in combination with either elevated temperature or non-denaturing levels of guanidine HCl or urea. The effects of a range of temperature, pressure, and chaotrope concentrations were tested and led to optimal conditions that approached 100% yield of native protein. The aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl required higher concentrations of urea or GdnHCl, or higher temperature or pressure for a yield equivalent to that for aggregates formed in buffer alone. Investigation of the effects of pressure, temperature, and chaotrope on unfolding of rhGH documented that under conditions used for optimal high pressure disaggregation and refolding, the native state is greatly favored thermodynamically (e.g. 25 kJ/mol at 2000 bar and 0.75 m GdnHCl). Dissolution of aggregates under pressure is a kinetically limited process. Comparison of refolding yields in GdnHCl and urea solutions suggest that pressure effects on electrostatic interactions do not dominate pressure effects on disaggregation. We suggest that non-native hydrogen bonds between protein molecules within aggregates of recombinant human growth hormone are responsible for the rate-limiting kinetic barrier in pressure-induced disaggregation.	2001 Dec	St John R J,Carpenter J F,Balny C,Randolph T W	The Journal of biological chemistry. 276(50) 46856-63	Growth Hormone	FPTIPLSRLFDNAMLRAHRLHQLAFDTYQEFEEAYIPKEQKYSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNREETQQKSNLELLRISLLLIQSWLEPVQFLRSVFANSLVYGASDSNVYDLLKDLEEGIQTLMGRLEDGSPRTGQIFKQTYSKFDTNSHNDDALLKNYGLLYCFRKDMDKVETFLRIVQCRSVEGSCGF		P01241			6	65	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
10681059	Refolding and purification of a urokinase plasminogen activator fragment by chromatography.	A fragment of recombinant urokinase plasminogen activator (u-PA), was expressed in E. coli in the form of inclusion bodies. Purification and renaturation was achieved in a three-stage process. Capture of the inclusion bodies was achieved by coupling wash steps in Triton X-100 and urea with centrifugation. Solubilised inclusion bodies were then renatured by buffer exchange performed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEPROS). Use of size-exclusion media with higher fractionation ranges resulted in an increase in the recovery of u-PA activity, to a maximum fractionation range of Mr 10000-1500000 after which recovery is reduced, due to a low resolution between the refolded u-PA and denaturant. Fractions of refolded u-PA were concentrated using cation ion-exchange chromatography, which selectively binds correctly folded u-PA. The result is concentrated, active, homogeneous u-PA.	2000 Jan	Fahey E M,Chaudhuri J B,Binding P	Journal of chromatography.

12182825	Large-scale production of functional human adrenomedullin: expression, cleavage, amidation, and purification.	Human adrenomedullin (hAM) is a 52-amino-acid regulatory peptide containing a six-membered ring structure and an amidated C-terminus, features that are essential for its biological activity. Here, we describe a simple and effective protocol for producing large quantities of highly pure, functional recombinant hAM. A peptide precursor (hAM-Gly) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with thioredoxin and collected as inclusion bodies. The fusion protein was then digested with BLase, a glutamate-specific endopeptidase, to prepare hAM-Gly. The essential ring structure formed spontaneously, while the terminal amide was generated by conversion of the added glycine residue using peptidylglycine alpha-amidating enzyme. The low solubility of hAM-Gly enabled the use of a selective precipitation/extraction method to generate a product that was 80-90d0c850ure, which was sufficient to proceed with the alpha-amidating enzyme reaction. The resultant hAM was then purified further by column chromatography. The final yield was about 82 mg/L of bacterial culture, and the purity, determined by reverse phase HPLC, was &gt;99.5%. The recombinant hAM was biologically active, eliciting concentration-dependent increases in cAMP in CHO-K1 cells expressing a specific hAM receptor and hypotensive responses when intravenously injected into rats. This new approach to the synthesis of hAM is simpler and more cost-effective for large-scale production than chemical synthesis. It therefore represents a new powerful tool that has the potential to facilitate analysis of the structure and function of hAM, as well as the development of new therapeutic protocols for the treatment of ailments such as hypertension.	2002 Aug	Mitsuda Yuuichi,Takimoto Akio,Kamitani Shigeki,Kitamura Kazuo,Sakata Tsuneaki,Mitsushima Kenji	Protein expression and purification. 25(3) 448-55	Adrenomedullin	YRQSMNNFQGLRSFGCRFGTCTVQKLAHQIYQFTDKDKDNVAPRSKISPQGYG	Thioredoxin-protein fusion, incorporating aa.95-146 (mature protein), but thioredoxin cleaved prior to refolding,N-terminal thioredoxin	P35318			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12071709	Refolding and purification of recombinant human PDE7A expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies.	We have investigated the refolding and purification of the catalytic domain of human 3&#39;,5&#39;-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 7A1 (PDE7A1) expressed in Escherichia coli. A cDNA encoding an N-terminal-truncated PDE7A1(147-482-His) was amplified by RT-PCR from human peripheral blood cells and inserted into the vector pET21-C for bacterial expression of the enzyme fused to a C-terminal His-tag. The PDE was found to be expressed in the form of inclusion bodies which could be refolded to an active enzyme in buffer containing high concentrations of arginine hydrochloride, ethylene glycol, and magnesium chloride at pH 8.5. The PDE7A1(147-482-His) construct could be purified after dialysis and concentration steps by either Zn2+-IDA-Sepharose chromatography or ResourceQ ion-exchange chromatography to homogeneity. In comparison to the metal-chelate column, the ResourceQ purification resulted in a distinctly better yield and enrichment of the protein. Both the Vmax (0.46 micromol. min(-1). mg(-1) ) and the K(m) (0.1 microM) of the purified enzyme were found to be comparable with published data for native or recombinant catalytically active expressed PDE7A1. Using SDS/PAGE, a molecular mass of 39 kDa was determined (theoretical value 38.783 kDa). As known from several other mammalian PDEs, size-exclusion chromatography using refolded PDE7A1(147-482-His) indicated the formation of dimers. The purified enzyme was soluble at concentrations up to 100 microg/ml. A further increase of protein concentration resulted, however, in precipitation of the enzyme.	2002 Jun	Richter Wito,Hermsdorf Thomas,Kronbach Thomas,Dettmer Dietrich	Protein expression and purification. 25(1) 138-48	3,5-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase 7A	MLEKVGNWNFDIFLFDRLTNGNSLVSLTFHLFSLHGLIEYFHLDMMKLRRFLVMIQEDYHSQNPYHNAVHAADVTQAMHCYLKEPKLANSVTPWDILLSLIAAATHDLDHPGVNQPFLIKTNHYLATLYKNTSVLENHHWRSAVGLLRESGLFSHLPLESRQQMETQIGALILATDISRQNEYLSLFRSHLDRGDLCLEDTRHRHLVLQMALKCADICNPCRTWELSKQWSEKVTEEFFHQGDIEKKYHLGVSPLCDRHTESIANIQIGFMTYLVEPLFTEWARFSNTRLSQTMLGHVGLNKASWKGLQREQSSSEDTDAAFELNSQLLPQENRLSLGHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q13946		catalytic domain (aa.147-482)	8.5	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10099541	High yield refolding and purification process for recombinant human interleukin-6 expressed in Escherichia coli.	Recombinant human interleukin-6 (hIL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine containing two intramolecular disulfide bonds, was expressed in Escherichia coli as an insoluble inclusion body, before being refolded and purified in high yield providing sufficient qualities for clinical use. Quantitative reconstitution of the native disulfide bonds of hIL-6 from the fully denatured E. coli extracts could be performed by glutathione-assisted oxidation in a completely denaturating condition (6M guanidinium chloride) at protein concentrations higher than 1 mg/mL, preventing aggregation of reduced hIL-6. Oxidation in 6M guanidinium chloride (GdnHCl) required remarkably low concentrations of glutathione (reduced form, 0.01 mM; oxidized form, 0.002 mM) to be added to the solubilized hIL-6 before the incubation at pH 8.5, and 22 degrees C for 16 h. After completion of refolding by rapid transfer of oxidized hIL-6 into acetate buffer by gel filtration chromatography, residual contaminants including endotoxin and E. coli proteins were efficiently removed by successive steps of chromatography. The amount of dimeric hIL-6s, thought to be purification artifacts, was decreased by optimizing the salt concentrations of the loading materials in the ion-exchange chromatography, and gradually removing organic solvents from the collected fractions of the preparative reverse-phase HPLC. These refolding and purification processes, which give an overall yield as high as 17%, seem to be appropriate for the commercial scale production of hIL-6 for therapeutic use.	1999 Feb	Ejima D,Watanabe M,Sato Y,Date M,Yamada N,Takahara Y	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 62(3) 301-10	Interleukin-6	MNSFSTSAFGPVAFSLGLLLVLPAAFPAPVPPGEDSKDVAAPHRQPLTSSERIDKQIRYILDGISALRKETCNKSNMCESSKEALAENNLNLPKMAEKDGCFQSGFNEETCLVKIITGLLEFEVYLEYLQNRFESSEEQARAVQMSTKVLIQFLQKKAKNLDAITTPDPTTNASLLTKLQAQNQWLQDMTTHLILRSFKEFLQSSLRALRQM		P05231			5	22	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
14680941	Refolding and characterization of the functional ligand-binding domain of human lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor.	Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor (LOX-1), a type II membrane protein that can recognize a variety of structurally unrelated macromolecules, plays an important role in host defense and is implicated in atherogenesis. To understand the interaction between human LOX-1 and its ligands, in this study the functional C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) of LOX-1 was reconstituted at high efficiency from inactive aggregates in Escherichia coli using a refolding technique based on an artificial chaperone. The CD spectra of the purified domain suggested that the domain has alpha-helical structure and the blue shift of Trp residues was observed on refolding of the domain. Like wild-type hLOX-1, the refolded CTLD domain was able to bind modified LDL. Thus, even though CTLD contains six Cys residues that form disulfide bonds, it recovered its specific binding ability on refolding. This suggests that the correct disulfide bonds in CTLD were formed by the artificial chaperone technique. Although the domain lacked N-glycosylation, it showed high affinity for its ligand in surface plasmon resonance experiments. Thus, unglycosylated CTLD is sufficient for binding modified LDL.	2003 Nov	Xie Qiuhong,Matsunaga Shigeru,Shi Xiaohua,Ogawa Setsuko,Niimi Setsuko,Wen Zhesheng,Tokuyasu Ken,Machida Sachiko	Protein expression and purification. 32(1) 68-74	Lectin-like oxidised LDL receptor	mgsshhhhhhssglvprgshmasmtggqqmgrCPQDWIWHGENCYLFSSGSFNWEKSQEKCLSLDAKLLKINSTADLDFIQQAISYSSFPFWMGLSRRNPSYPWLWEDGSPLMPHLFRVRGAVSQTYPSGTCAYIQRGAVYAENCILAAFSICQKKANLRAQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P78380			7.4	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
14711499	Production of tilapia insulin-like growth factor-2 in high cell density cultures of recombinant Escherichia coli.	An improved expression plasmid pET-insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF2) was constructed and transferred into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) for the expression of tilapia insulin-like growth factor-2. The recombinant insulin-like growth factor-2 was produced as inclusion bodies, and the recombinant insulin-like growth factor-2 content was as high as 10.30f the total protein content. For production of recombinant insulin-like growth factor-2 in E. coli, pH-stat fed-batch cultures were used to achieve a high cell density culture. A cell concentration 183gl(-1) dry cell weight (DCW) was obtained after 30h cultivation and plasmid stability was maintained at high levels. Expression of insulin-like growth factor-2 was induced at three different cell concentrations, 50, 78.5, and 114.5gl(-1) dry cell weight. When cells were induced at a cell concentration of 114.5gl(-1) dry cell weight, the amount of insulin-like growth factor-2 produced was 9.69gl(-1) (11.30f the total protein). Using a simple purification process including inclusion body isolation, denaturation, refolding and Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, 19.51mg of insulin-like growth factor-2 was obtained from a 22.5ml of culture, and the recovery yield was 20.5%. The biological activity of the purified IGF-2 was demonstrated as promoting the growth of four different cell lines by the colorimetric bioassay and the best growth stimulation ratio was obtained for the Balb/3T3 clone 31A cell line.	2004 Jan	Hu Shao-Yang,Wu Jen-Leih,Huang Jan-Hsiung	Journal of biotechnology. 107(2) 161-71	Insulin-like growth factor II	MAMEMASAETLFGGKLVDALQFVCEDRSFYFSRPTSRGNNRRPQTRGIVEECLFCSCDLNLLEQYCAKPAKSEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	O73722			7.3	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14680965	High-level expression and one-step purification of recombinant dengue virus type 2 envelope domain III protein in Escherichia coli.	Dengue virus infection poses a serious global public health threat for which there is currently no therapy or a licensed vaccine. The domain III of the dengue virus encoded envelope protein, which carries multiple conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes, is critical for virus infectivity. We have expressed and purified recombinant domain III of dengue virus type-2 envelope, without the aid of a carrier protein in Escherichia coli. A 6x His tag was inserted at the N terminus to facilitate its one-step purification. The protein was overexpressed in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies, which were solubilized under highly denaturing conditions and then subjected to a previously optimized arginine-mediated renaturation protocol. We purified recombinant domain III protein to near homogeneity by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and obtained yields of approximately 30 mg/L. The purified protein was recognized in Western analyses by monoclonal antibodies specific for the 6x His tag as well as the 3H5 neutralizing epitope known to reside in domain III. The authenticity of the recombinant protein was also verified in a sandwich ELISA designed to specifically and simultaneously identify the 6x His tag and the 3H5 epitope. In addition, murine and human polyclonal sera also recognized the recombinant protein. The in vitro refolded recombinant protein preparation was biologically functional. It could effectively protect cells in culture against dengue virus type-2 infection, apparently by blocking the virus from binding to host cells. This expression/purification strategy has the potential for inexpensive scale-up and may prove to be useful for dengue diagnostics and vaccine development efforts.	2004 Jan	Jaiswal Smita,Khanna Navin,Swaminathan Sathyamangalam	Protein expression and purification. 33(1) 80-91	Dengue virus type 2 envelope domain III	HHHHHHAWLVHRQWFLDLPLPWLPGADTQGSNWIQKETLVTFKNPHAKKQDVVVLGSQEGAMHTALTGATEIQMSSGNLLFTGHLKCRLRMDKLQLKGMSYSMCTGKFKVVKEIAETQHGTIVIRVQYEGDGSPCKIPFEIMDLEKRH	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P29984		Domain III, aa.254-395	7.5	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8106371	Preparation of the extracellular domain of the rabbit prolactin receptor expressed in Escherichia coli and its interaction with lactogenic hormones.	The cDNA of the extracellular domain of the rabbit prolactin receptor (rbPRLR-ECD) was cloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pTrc99A to enable its expression in Escherichia coli after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside. The bacterially expressed rbPRLR-ECD protein, contained within the refractile body pellet, was solubilized in 4.5 M urea, refolded, and purified on a Q-Sepharose column by stepwise elution with NaCl. The bioactive monomeric fraction was eluted in 0.05 M NaCl, yielding 15-20 mg/8 liters of induced culture. The purified protein was &gt; 980mogeneous, as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence or absence of reducing agent and by chromatography on a Superdex column. Its molecular mass was 25 kDa as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the absence of reducing agent and 22 kDa as determined by gel filtration. Binding experiments revealed remarkable differences between rabbit and porcine prolactins (PRLs) and the other tested lactogenic hormones. Gel filtration was used to determine the stoichiometry of the rbPRLR-ECD interaction with ovine, rabbit, and porcine PRLs, with human growth hormone and its truncated des-7 analogue, and with bovine placental lactogen (bPL) and des-13-bPL. The formation of only 1:1 complexes was indicated, except with bPL, for which a 2:1 complex was detected. Identical stoichiometry was also obtained using excess radiolabeled rbPRLR-ECD in gel filtration experiments. Interaction of 125I-labeled ovine PRL with rbPRLR-ECD secreted into conditioned medium by rbPRLR-ECD cDNA-transfected COS 7 cells also indicated formation of 1:1 molar complexes. Despite the differences in binding potency and stoichiometries of the interaction with rbPRLR-ECD, all seven tested hormones were biologically active in inducing PRL receptor-mediated casein synthesis in explants of rabbit mammary gland. We therefore propose that the formation of the 1:2 complexes with soluble rbPRLR-ECD is not predictive of biological activity of the different lactogenic hormones.	1994 Feb	Bignon C,Sakal E,Belair L,Chapnik-Cohen N,Djiane J,Gertler A	The Journal of biological chemistry. 269(5) 3318-24	Prolactin receptor extracellular domain	MGKPFIFKCRSPEKETFTCWWRPGADGGLPTNYTLTYHKEGETITHECPDYKTGGPNSCYFSKKHTSIWTIYIITVNATNQMGSSVSDPRYVDVTYIVEPDPPVNLTLEVKHPEDRKPYLWVKWLPPTLVDVRSGWLTLQYEIRLKPEKAAEWETHFAGQQTQFKILSLYPGQKYLVQVRCKPDHGFWSVWSPESSIQIPNDFTMKD		P14787		Extracellular domain aa.29-235	11.3	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8674857	Preparation and characterization of recombinant prolactin receptor extracellular domain from rat.	Complementary (c)DNA of the extracellular domain of rat prolactin receptor (rPRLR-ECD) was cloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pTrc99A, and expressed in Escherichia coli following induction with isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside. The expressed rPRLR-ECD protein, contained within the refractile body pellet was solubilized in 4.5 M urea, refolded and purified on a Q-Sepharose column by stepwise elution with NaCl. Only approximately 100f the expressed protein refolded as a monomeric fraction, yielding 5-6 mg/l of induced culture. The purified protein was over 980mogeneous, as shown by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of reducing agent, and by chromatography on a Superdex column. Its molecular mass, determined by SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agent, was 28 kDa, and by gel filtration, 25.6 kDa. Binding experiments indicated high affinity for bovine placental lactogen (bPL) and human growth hormone (hGH) as compared to ovine (o) or rat PRLs. Gel filtration was used to determine the stoichiometry of rPRLR-ECD&#39;s interaction with these hormones. At a 5 microM initial concentration of the hormones, formation of 2:1 (ECD:ligand) complexes was detected with bPL, hGH and oPRL whereas only 1:1 complex was formed with rPRL. Dilution (25-fold) of these complexes did not affect the stoichiometry with bPL, whereas with hGH a clear tendency towards dissociation of the initial 2:1 complex to 1:1 complex was observed. This tendency was even stronger in the case of oPRL. Although all four hormones exhibited nearly identical activities in the Nb2-11C lymphoma cell bioassay, the ability of the purified rat or rabbit PRLR-ECD to inhibit hormonal mitogenic activity generally reflected their affinity for the respective hormones. In view of these and former results, we suggest that unlike in the GH:GHR-ECD interaction, the inability of lactogenic hormones to form a 1:2 complex with soluble recombinant PRLR-ECDs does not necessarily predicts lack of biological activity.	1995 Nov	Sandowski Y,Nagano M,Bignon C,Djiane J,Kelly P A,Gertler A	Molecular and cellular endocrinology. 115(1) 1-11	Prolactin receptor extracellular domain	MGKPEIHKCRSPDKETFTCWWNPGTDGGLPTNYSLTYSKEGEKTTYECPDYKTSGPNSCFFSKQYTSIWKIYIITVNATNQMGSSSSDPLYVDVTYIVEPEPPRNLTLEVKQLKDKKTYLWVKWSPPTITDVKTGWFTMEYEIRLKPEEAEEWEIHFTGHQTQFKVFDLYPGQKYLVQTRCKPDHGYWSRWSQESSVEMPNDFTLKD		P05710		Extracellular domain aa.24-229	11.3	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8226833	Overexpression of fetal human pigment epithelium-derived factor in Escherichia coli. A functionally active neurotrophic factor.	Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a neurotrophic protein present in low amounts in conditioned medium of cultured fetal human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Recently, the PEDF cDNA has been cloned from a fetal human cDNA library, and its derived amino acid sequence identified it as a member of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) supergene family (Steele, F. R., Chader, G. J., Johnson, L. V., and Tombran-Tink, J. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 1526-1530). We have prepared recombinant expression constructs from the fetal human PEDF cDNA and obtained milligram amounts of biologically active PEDF from Escherichia coli. The full-length open reading frame (Met1-Pro418) and a truncated form (Asp44-Pro418) were used in our constructs. Induction from a vector containing the truncated PEDF version, named pEV-BH, produced a protein (BH) of expected size (M(r) 42,800) associated with inclusion bodies, which contained 25-400f expressed protein. After solubilization, BH was highly purified by gel filtration and cation exchange chromatography. The NH2-terminal sequence of the purified protein matched that of the pEV-BH construct. We have conducted neurite outgrowth assays in a human retinoblastoma Y-79 cell culture system. Recombinant PEDF (BH) demonstrated neurotrophic activity, as reported for the native PEDF. Thus, unfolded and refolded in vitro BH retained a potent biological activity. In parallel experiments, protease inhibition assays were performed. Recombinant PEDF did not have an effect on trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, cathepsin G, endoproteinase Lys-C, endoproteinase Glu-C, or subtilisin activity, suggesting that inhibition of known serine proteases is not the biochemical pathway for the PEDF neutrophic activity.	1993 Nov	Becerra S P,Palmer I,Kumar A,Steele F,Shiloach J,Notario V,Chader G J	The Journal of biological chemistry. 268(31) 23148-56	Pigment epithelium-derived factor	DSTGALVEEEDPFFKVPVNKLAAAVSNFGYDLYRVRSSMSPTTNVLLSPLSVATALSALSLGAEQRTESIIHRALYYDLISSPDIHGTYKELLDTVTAPQKNLKSASRIVFEKKLRIKSSFVAPLEKSYGTRPRVLTGNPRLDLQEINNWVQAQMKGKLARSTKEIPDEISILLLGVAHFKGQWVTKFDSRKTSLEDFYLDEERTVRVPMMSDPKAVLRYGLDSDLSCKIAQLPLTGSMSIIFFLPLKVTQNLTLIEESLTSEFIHDIDRELKTVQAVLTVPKLKLSYEGEVTKSLQEMKLQSLFDSPDFSKITGKPIKLTQVEHRAGFEWNEDGAGTTPSPGLQPAHLTFPLDYHLNQPFIFVLRDTDTGALLFIGKILDPRGP		P36955		Truncated form aa.44-418	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8535153	Purification of recombinant human rhinovirus 14 3C protease expressed in Escherichia coli.	A gene encoding the human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14) sequence for expression of the viral polypeptide protein delta 3ABC was inserted into a plasmid driven by the heat-inducible bacteriophage lambda PL promoter. The coding sequence was also inserted into a pET vector for expression in the T7 system to produce 13C, 15N-labeled protein. The expressed HRV14 3C protease (3Cpro) autocatalytically cleaved itself from the polyprotein delta 3ABC, and the mature HRV14 3Cpro partitioned predominantly, in the case of the T7 system, in the insoluble fraction and exclusively, in the case of the PL system, in the insoluble fraction. The insoluble HRV14 3Cpro was solubilized in urea and purified using anion- and cation-exchange chromatography. The protease was refolded/activated and further purified using a size-exclusion column. HRV14 3Cpro was purified to &gt; 900mogeneity as shown by SDS-PAGE and to 950y HPLC. A continuous fluorescence assay was developed which utilized an intramolecularly quenched 9-amino-acid substrate. The substrate anthranilic acid (Anc)-Thr-Leu-Phe-Gln-Gly-Pro-Val-(p-NO2)-Phe-Lys mimicked the natural 2C/3A cleavage site (Thr-Leu-Phe-Gln-Gly-Pro-Val-Tyr-Phe) using an N-terminal anthranilic acid donor group on one side of the scissile bond (Gln/Gly) and a p-NO2-Phe acceptor group at the P4 position. Measured by the fluorescence assay, HRV14 3Cpro had a Km of 300 microM for the substrate.	1995 Oct	Birch G M,Black T,Malcolm S K,Lai M T,Zimmerman R E,Jaskunas S R	Protein expression and purification. 6(5) 609-18	Picorain 3C (Protease 3C)	TLRPVVVQGPNTEFALSLLRKNIMTITTSKGEFTGLGIHDRVCVIPTHAQPGDDVLVNGQKIRVKDKYKLVDPENINLELTVLTLDRNEKFRDIRGFISEDLEGVDATLVVHSNNFTNTILEVGPVTMAGLINLSSTPTNRMIRYDYATKTGQCGGVLCATGKIFGIHVGGNGR		P03303			6.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
15642480	Refolding and one-step purification of recombinant human ARA70 over-expressed in Escherichia coli.	Androgen receptor (AR)-associated coregulator 70 (ARA70) is a cytoplasmic protein that has been characterized to have the ability to induce AR transcriptional activity in response to androgens and anti-androgens in prostate cancer cells. AR has been shown to have an important role in the progression of prostate cancer and in normal male reproductive system development. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms and biological relevance of ARA70 to prostrate cancer using a variety of biochemical analyses, the cDNA encoding full length ARA70 was cloned into pET21b vector. Here, we report the refolding and one-step purification of ARA70 from inclusion bodies over-expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was purified to homogeneity, yielding approximately 60 mg ARA70 from 1L of terrific broth media. Refolding process of ARA70 was monitored using far-UV CD analysis.	2005 Feb	Singh Vinay Kumar,Jia Zongchao	Protein expression and purification. 39(2) 283-7	Androgen receptor (AR)-associated coregulator 70	MNTFQDQSGSSSNREPLLRCSDARRDLELAIGGVLRAEQQIKDNLREVKAQIHSCISRHLECLRSREVWLYEQVDLIYQLKEETLQQQAQQLYSLLGQFNCLTHQLECTQNKDLANQVSVCLERLGSLTLKPEDSTVLLFEADTITLRQTITTFGSLKTIQIPEHLMAHASSANIGPFLEKRGCISMPEQKSASGIVAVPFSEWLLGSKPASGYQAPYIPSTDPQDWLTQKQTLENSQTSSRACNFFNNVGGNLKGLENWLLKSEKSSYQKCNSHSTTSSFSIEMEKVGDQELPDQDEMDLSDWLVTPQESHKLRKPENGSRETSEKFKLLFQSYNVNDWLVKTDSCTNCQGNQPKGVEIENLGNLKCLNDHLEAKKPLSTPSMVTEDWLVQNHQDPCKVEEVCRANEPCTSFAECVCDENCEKEALYKWLLKKEGKDKNGMPVEPKPEPEKHKDSLNMWLCPRKEVIEQTKAPKAMTPSRIADSFQVIKNSPLSEWLIRPPYKEGSPKEVPGTEDRAGKQKFKSPMNTSWCSFNTADWVLPGKKMGNLSQLSSGEDKWLLRKKAQEVLLNSPLQEEHNFPPDHYGLPAVCDLFACMQLKVDKEKWLYRTPLQM	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q13772			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
15490124	Oxaloacetate decarboxylase of Archaeoglobus fulgidus: cloning of genes and expression in Escherichia coli.	Archaeoglobus fulgidus harbors three consecutive and one distantly located gene with similarity to the oxaloacetate decarboxylase Na+ pump of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KpOadGAB). The water-soluble carboxyl transferase (AfOadA) and the biotin protein (AfOadC) were readily synthesized in Escherichia coli, but the membrane-bound subunits AfOadB and AfOadG were not. AfOadA was affinity purified from inclusion bodies after refolding and AfOadC was affinity purified from the cytosol. Isolated AfOadA catalyzed the carboxyl transfer from [4-14C]-oxaloacetate to the prosthetic biotin group of AfOadC or the corresponding biotin domain of KpOadA. Conversely, the carboxyl transferase domain of KpOadA exhibited catalytic activity not only with its pertinent biotin domain but also withAfOadC.	2004 Nov	Dahinden Pius,Pos Klaas M,Taralczak Malgorzata,Dimroth Peter	Archives of microbiology. 182(5) 414-20	oxaloacetate decarboxylase, apha-subunit	MRTRDMLPILETLDESGIYSLEVWGGATFDACHRFLNENPWERLREIRKRVKNAKLQMLLRGQNLVGYRHYPDDIVEKFVQKTIENGLDVFRIFDALNDVRNLISSIKAAKKYNADHIQGTICYTISPVHTVEKYVEIANELAALEVDSICLKDMAGMLSPKMAYELVKALKKEVGLPINVHSHYTSGMASMALLKGVEAGAEMIDTCMSPLSSGTSHPPTESMVYALNELGYDTGVKLDILLEAREYFMKIREKYSGYLNPLSTIPDTRVLVYQIPGGMFSNLIAQLQEQNALDRLQEVLEEVPRVREDLGYPPLVTPTSQIVGVQAVINVLVGERYKVVTRETKDLVKGMYGRTPAPIKPEIVKKILGDEKPIDCRPADLLEPEFEKRKQELIEAGIENPSDEDVLLYALFPQTGLKFLKGEMVEEPFPVAGGKIEGSFEVEIDGQKYVVKVAPEK		O29016			8.5	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12960396	The crystal structure of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, a key autoantigen in multiple sclerosis.	Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a key CNS-specific autoantigen for primary demyelination in multiple sclerosis. Although the disease-inducing role of MOG has been established, its precise function in the CNS remains obscure. To gain new insights into the physiological and immunopathological role of MOG, we determined the 1.8-A crystal structure of the MOG extracellular domain (MOGED). MOGED adopts a classical Ig (Ig variable domain) fold that was observed to form an antiparallel head-to-tail dimer. A dimeric form of native MOG was observed, and MOGED was also shown to dimerize in solution, consistent with the view of MOG acting as a homophilic adhesion receptor. The MOG35-55 peptide, a major encephalitogenic determinant recognized by both T cells and demyelinating autoantibodies, is partly occluded within the dimer interface. The structure of this key autoantigen suggests a relationship between the dimeric form of MOG within the myelin sheath and a breakdown of immunological tolerance to MOG that is observed in multiple sclerosis.	2003 Sep	Clements Craig S,Reid Hugh H,Beddoe Travis,Tynan Fleur E,Perugini Matthew A,Johns Terrance G,Bernard Claude C A,Rossjohn Jamie	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 100(19) 11059-64	myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein	GQFRVIGPGYPIRALVGDEAELPCRISPGKNATGMEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGKDQDAEQAPEYRGRTELLKETISEGKVTLRIQNVRFSDEGGYTCFFRDHSYQEEAAMELKVEDPFYWVNPGVLT	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q61885			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
16015686	Procedure for preparing peptide-major histocompatibility complex tetramers for direct quantification of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.	AIM:To establish a simplified method for generating peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I tetramers.METHODS:cDNAs encoding the extracellular domain of human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 heavy chain (A2) and beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m) from total RNA extracted from leukocytes of HLA-A2(+) donors were cloned into separate expression vectors by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The recombinant A2 and beta(2)m proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) and recovered from the inclusion body fraction. Soluble A2 proteins loaded with specific antigen peptides were refolded by dilution from the heavy chain in the presence of light chain beta(2)m and HLA-A2-restricted peptide antigens. The refolded A2 monomers were biotinylated with a commercial biotinylation enzyme (BirA) and purified by low pressure anion exchange chromatography on a Q-Sepharose (fast flow) column. The tetramers were then formed by mixing A2 monomers with streptavidin-PE in a molar ratio of 4:1. Flow cytometry was used to confirm the expected tetramer staining of CD8(+) T cells.RESULTS:Recombinant genes for HLA-A*0201 heavy chain (A2) fused to a BirA substrate peptide (A2-BSP) and mature beta(2)m from HLA-A2(+) donor leukocytes were successfully cloned and highly expressed in E. coli. Two soluble monomeric A2-peptide complexes were reconstituted from A2-BSP in the presence of beta(2)m and peptides loaded with either human cytomegalovirus pp65(495-503) peptide (NLVPMVATV, NLV; designated as A2-NLV) or influenza virus matrix protein Mp58-66 peptide (GILGFVFTL, GIL; designated as A2-GIL). Refolded A2-NLV or A2-GIL monomers were biotinylated and highly purified by single step anion exchange column chromatography. The tetramers were then formed by mixing the biotinylated A2-NLV or A2-GIL monomers with streptavidin-PE, leading to more than 80% multiplication as revealed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing, unboiled conditions. Flow cytometry revealed that these tetramers could specifically bind to CD8(+) T cells from a HLA-A2(+) donor, but failed to bind to those from a HLA-A2- donor.CONCLUSION:The procedure is simple and efficient for generating peptide-MHC tetramers.	2005 Jul	He Xian-Hui,Xu Li-Hui,Liu Yi	World journal of gastroenterology : WJG. 11(27) 4180-7	Major histocompatibility complex class I	MEPSLLSLFVLGVVALTETRAGSHSLRYFDTAMSRPELGDSQFISVGYVDDQQFVRFDSSSESPRMEPRAAWMDKVDQEDPNYWEGQTQISRSNAQITRVGLETIRGYYNQSRGGLHTYQTMIGCEVHPDGSFRKGFWQHAYDGHDYIALDRETLTWTAADPGAENTKRKWEAERSIAERYKAYLEEECVQWLKKYLQMGKDVLLRTEPSSARVSRHSGPDGEVSLRCRAQGFYPAEISLTWLRDGEEQLQDTEFIETRPGGDGTFQKWAAVAMAPGQEDRYSCRVQHEALAQPLSLRWEPEASSLWVIVGVTAGVLVLVTAVVAGAVILRRRNSGGKGGAYVPGAA	C-terminal  BirA substrate peptide	Q9TPK7			8	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16084621	Purification and characterization of an L-arabinose isomerase from an isolated strain of Geobacillus thermodenitrificans producing D-tagatose.	The araA gene, encoding l-arabinose isomerase (AI), from the thermophilic bacterium Geobacillus thermodenitrificans was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant AI was isolated with a final purity of about 97% and a final specific activity of 2.10 U/mg. The molecular mass of the purified AI was estimated to be about 230 kDa to be a tetramer composed of identical subunits. The AI exhibited maximum activity at 70 degrees C and pH 8.5 in the presence of Mn2+. The enzyme was stable at temperatures below 60 degrees C and within the pH range 7.5-8.0. d-Galactose and l-arabinose as substrate were isomerized with high activities. Ribitol was the strongest competitive inhibitor of AI with a Ki of 5.5mM. The apparent Km and Vmax for L-arabinose were 142 mM and 86 U/mg, respectively, whereas those for d-galactose were 408 mM and 6.9 U/mg, respectively. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was 48 mM(-1)min(-1) for L-arabinose and 0.5mM(-1)min(-1) for D-galactose. Mn2+ was a competitive activator and increased the thermal stability of the AI. The D-tagatose yield produced by AI from d-galactose was 46% without the addition of Mn2+ and 48% with Mn2+ after 300 min at 65 degrees C.	2005 Nov	Kim Hye-Jung,Oh Deok-Kun	Journal of biotechnology. 120(2) 162-73	CLIPB14	MYSRRYVACGLLCLLVIAIDQGHGQEHKPCTTPNGTAGRCVRVRECGYVLDLLRKDLFAHSDTVHLEGLQCGTRPDGGALVCCPAFVNEPNCGPSVFGVRIIGGNDTELGEFPWMALLRFQARNRKIHGNCGASLVSKRFVLSAAHCFTAAKSKGWKIHSVRVAEWNFMNHRGSKDCKQVKGYDVPICRKDYDVARFVQHPEYRVNAGVHVNDIVLIELAADVEYNVFVAPICLPVSNDTAQLPWGSSDDPEIEYTAAGWGSTESGKESTGMSYQLKQINLRAFNKERCKKLFQVPSGVGVGLGHICAGGIRDEDTCHGDSGGPLMEAVGGVWYLAGITSFGWPRCGRDGVPGVYTNISHYMGWLEREMFRGILA	Ftr	Q7QGN4			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15373841	Expression and characterization of the protein Rv1399c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A novel carboxyl esterase structurally related to the HSL family.	The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome contains an unusually high number of proteins involved in the metabolism of lipids belonging to the Lip family, including various nonlipolytic and lipolytic hydrolases. Driven by a structural genomic approach, we have biochemically characterized the Rv1399c gene product, LipH, previously annotated as a putative lipase. Rv1399c was overexpressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies and refolded. Rv1399c efficiently hydrolyzes soluble triacylglycerols and vinyl esters. It is inactive against emulsified substrate and its catalytic activity is strongly inhibited by the diethyl paranitrophenyl phosphate (E600). These kinetic behaviors unambiguously classify Rv1399c as a nonlipolytic rather than a lipolytic hydrolase. Sequence alignment reveals that this enzyme belongs to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family and shares 30-40% amino acid sequence identity with members of the hormone-sensitive lipase subfamily. A model of Rv1399c derived from homologous three-dimensional structures reveals a canonical catalytic triad (Ser162, His290 and Asp260) located at the bottom of a solvent accessible pocket lined by neutral or charged residues. Based on this model, kinetic data of the Arg213Ala mutant partially explain the role of the guanidinium moiety, located close to His290, to confer an unusual low pH shift of the catalytic histidine in the wild type enzyme. Overall, these data identify Rv1399c as a new nonlipolytic hydrolase from M. tuberculosis and we thus propose to reannotate its gene product as NLH-H.	2004 Oct	Canaan Stéphane,Maurin Damien,Chahinian Henri,Pouilly Bénédicte,Durousseau Cécile,Frassinetti Frédéric,Scappuccini-Calvo Loréna,Cambillau Christian,Bourne Yves	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 271(19) 3953-61	NLH-Rv1399c	MTEPTVARPDIDPVLKMLLDTFPVTFTAADGVEVARARLRQLKTPPELLPELRIEERTVGYDGLTDIPVRVYWPPVVRDNLPVVVYYHGGGWSLGGLDTHDPVARAHAVGAQAIVVSVDYRLAPEHPYPAGIDDSWAALRWVGENAAELGGDPSRIAVAGDSAGGNISAVMAQLARDVGGPPLVFQLLWYPTTMADLSLPSFTENADAPILDRDVIDAFLAWYVPGLDISDHTMLPTTLAPGNADLSGLPPAFIGTAEHDPLRDDGACYAELLTAAGVSVELSNEPTMVHGYVNFALVVPAAAEATGRGLAALKRALHA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P71667			7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

9109649	Nitric oxide binding and crystallization of recombinant nitrophorin I, a nitric oxide transport protein from the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus.	A nitric oxide transport protein (nitrophorin I) from the salivary glands of the blood-sucking bug Rhodnius prolixus has been expressed as an insoluble form in Escherichia coli, reconstituted with heme, and characterized with respect to NO binding kinetics and equilibria. NO binding and absorption spectra for recombinant nitrophorin I were indistinguishable from those of the insect-derived protein. The degree of NO binding, the rate of NO release, and the Soret absorption maxima for nitrophorin I were all pH dependent. The NO dissociation constant rose 9-fold over the pH range 5.0-8.3, from 0.19 x 10(-6) to 1.71 x 10(-6). The NO dissociation rate rose 2500-fold between pH 5.0 and pH 8.3, from 1.2 x 10(-3) to 3.0 s(-1). Thus, the NO association rate must also be pH dependent and reduced at pH 5.0 by approximately 280-fold. These factors are consistent with nitrophorin function: NO storage in the apparent low pH of insect salivary glands and NO release into the tissue of the insect&#39;s host, where vasodilation is induced. The reversible nature of NO binding, which does not occur with most other heme proteins, and the apparent kinetic control of NO release are discussed. We also report crystals of nitrophorin I that are suitable for structure determination by X-ray crystallography. The most promising crystal form contains two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit and diffracts beyond 2.0 A resolution.	1997 Apr	Andersen J F,Champagne D E,Weichsel A,Ribeiro J M,Balfour C A,Dress V,Montfort W R	Biochemistry. 36(15) 4423-8	nitrophorins 1-4 from Rhodnius prolixus	KCTKNALAQTGFNKDKYFNGDVWYVTDYLDLEPDDVPKRYCAALAAGTASGKLKEALYHYDPKTQDTFYDVSELQEESPGKYTANFKKVEKNGNVKVDVTSGNYYTFTVMYADDSSALIHTCLHKGNKDLGDLYAVLNRNKDTNAGDKVKGAVTAASLKFSDFISTKDNKCEYDNVSLKSLLTK					7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15637157	Heme-assisted S-nitrosation of a proximal thiolate in a nitric oxide transport protein.	Certain bloodsucking insects deliver nitric oxide (NO) while feeding, to induce vasodilation and inhibit blood coagulation. We have expressed, characterized, and determined the crystal structure of the Cimex lectularius (bedbug) nitrophorin, the protein responsible for NO storage and delivery, to understand how the insect successfully handles this reactive molecule. Surprisingly, NO binds not only to the ferric nitrophorin heme, but it can also be stored as an S-nitroso (SNO) conjugate of the proximal heme cysteine (Cys-60) when present at higher concentrations. EPR- and UV-visible spectroscopies, and a crystallographic structure determination to 1.75-A resolution, reveal SNO formation to proceed with reduction of the heme iron, yielding an Fe-NO complex. Stopped-flow kinetic measurements indicate that an ordered reaction mechanism takes place: initial NO binding occurs at the ferric heme and is followed by heme reduction, Cys-60 release from the heme iron, and SNO formation. Release of NO occurs through a reversal of these steps. These data provide, to our knowledge, the first view of reversible metal-assisted SNO formation in a protein and suggest a mechanism for its role in NO release from ferrous heme. This mechanism and Cimex nitrophorin structure are completely unlike those of the nitrophorins from Rhodnius prolixus, where NO protection is provided by a large conformational change that buries the heme nitrosyl complex, highlighting the remarkable evolution of proteins that assist insects in bloodfeeding.	2005 Jan	Weichsel Andrzej,Maes Estelle M,Andersen John F,Valenzuela Jesus G,Shokhireva Tatjana Kh,Walker F Ann,Montfort William R	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 102(3) 594-9	Nitrophorin from Cimex lectularius	MKLLLSAGAALAFVLGLCAAGSPPAQLSVHTVSWNSGHERAPTNLEELLGLNSGETPDVIAVAVQGFGFQTDKPQQGPACVKNFQSLLTSKGYTKLKNTITETMGLTVYCLEKHLDQNTLKNETIIVTVDDQKKSGGIVTSFTIYNKRFSFTTSRMSDEDVTSTNTKYAYDTRLDYSKKDDPSDFLFWIGDLNVRVETNATHAKSLVDQNNIDGLMAFDQLKKAKEQKLFDGWTEPQVTFKPTYKFKPNTDEYDLSATPSWTDRALYKSGTGKTIQPLSYNSLTNYKQTEHRPVLAKFRVTL		O76745			7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12651126	Fast purification of the Apo form and of a non-binding heme mutant of recombinant sperm whale myoglobin.	As molecular biology has developed it has become possible to abundantly produce heterologous proteins in bacteria and to design serial amino acid substitutions for the generation of modified proteins, an approach also known as protein engineering. Sperm whale myoglobin, a protein of broad interest, has been cloned for several years now and a large collection of mutants has been produced. The presence of heme stabilizes the protein, which is recovered soluble from the bacterial pellet, and most purification protocols take advantage of this property for myoglobin purification directly from the pellet. However, recovery from the column resin is poor with these methods making them expensive and the procedure for removing heme is laborious and drastic when the apo form of Mb is required. In the case of proteins with severe mutations, which bind heme weakly or do not bind it at all, such methods cannot be employed without massive loss of productivity. Here, we describe a modified method, which is both low cost and rapid, for the purification of the soluble apo form of Mb from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. Biophysical characterization of the protein after purification shows that the purified apoMb retains its native conformation and is soluble. This modified method is also used for the purification of a non-heme-binding apoMb mutant, demonstrating its efficiency when dealing with drastic mutations.	2003 Mar	Ribeiro Euripedes A,Regis Wiliam C B,Tasic Ljubica,Ramos Carlos H I	Protein expression and purification. 28(1) 202-8	Myoglobin	VLSEGEWQLVLHVWAKVEADVAGHGQDILIRLFKSHPETLEKFDRFKHLKTEAEMKASEDLKKHGVTVLTALGAILKKKGHHEAELKPLAQSHATKHKIPIKYLEFISEAIIHVLHSRHPGDFGADAQGAMNKALELFRKDIAAKYKELGYQG		P02185			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
12767811	Purification and folding of recombinant bovine oxoglutarate/malate carrier by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography.	A major obstacle to investigating the structure of membrane proteins is the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of functional protein. The oxoglutarate carrier, an intrinsic membrane-transport protein of the inner membranes of bovine-heart mitochondria, has been cloned as a fusion protein containing a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. This fusion protein has been expressed at an abundant level in a mutant strain of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) called C41 (DE3). The protein accumulated as inclusion bodies and none was detected in the bacterial inner membrane. The denatured protein was refolded to reconstitute functional properties similar to the native protein. Solubilized inclusion body protein was immobilized using nickel-chelating affinity chromatography, and purified and refolded in a single step. The protein eluted as a monomer which was stable in mild detergent, at a yield equivalent to 15 mg active protein/liter bacterial culture. The reconstituted fusion protein displayed the same transport characteristics as the wild-type, demonstrating that the tag does not perturb the structure of the protein. The oxoglutarate carrier is one member of an extensive family of mitochondrial transport proteins. These proteins transport many different metabolites across the inner mitochondrial membrane and share a common mechanism of action. Therefore, it is likely that this folding protocol can be applied successfully to other mitochondrial transport proteins, thus providing sufficient protein for extensive crystallization trials with a wide range of family members.	2003 Jun	Smith Vernon R,Walker John E	Protein expression and purification. 29(2) 209-16	oxoglutarate-malate carrier	AATASPGASGMDGKPRTSPKSVKFLFGGLAGMGATVFVQPLDLVKNRMQLSGEGAKTREYKTSFHALISILRAEGLRGIYTGLSAGLLRQATYTTTRLGIYTVLFERLTGADGTPPGFLLKAVIGMTAGATGAFVGTPAEVALIRMTADGRLPVDQRRGYKNVFNALFRIVQEEGVPTLWRGCIPTMARAVVVNAAQLASYSQSKQFLLDSGYFSDNILCHFCASMISGLVTTAASMPVDIVKTRIQNMRMIDGKPEYKNGLDVLVKVVRYEGFFSLWKGFTPYYARLGPHTVLTFIFLEQMNKAYKRLFLSG	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P22292			7.4	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	t	f	f	f
11279211	Biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterization of bacterially expressed and refolded receptor binding domain of Plasmodium vivax duffy-binding protein.	Invasion of erythrocytes by malaria parasites is mediated by specific molecular interactions. Plasmodium vivax is completely dependent on interaction with the Duffy blood group antigen to invade human erythrocytes. The P. vivax Duffy-binding protein, which binds the Duffy antigen during invasion, belongs to a family of erythrocyte-binding proteins that also includes Plasmodium falciparum sialic acid binding protein and Plasmodium knowlesi Duffy binding protein. The receptor binding domains of these proteins lie in a conserved, N-terminal, cysteine-rich region, region II, found in each of these proteins. Here, we have expressed P. vivax region II (PvRII), the P. vivax Duffy binding domain, in Escherichia coli. Recombinant PvRII is incorrectly folded and accumulates in inclusion bodies. We have developed methods to refold and purify recombinant PvRII in its functional conformation. Biochemical, biophysical, and functional characterization confirms that recombinant PvRII is pure, homogeneous, and functionally active in that it binds Duffy-positive human erythrocytes with specificity. Refolded PvRII is highly immunogenic and elicits high titer antibodies that can inhibit binding of P. vivax Duffy-binding protein to erythrocytes, providing support for its development as a vaccine candidate for P. vivax malaria. Development of methods to produce functionally active recombinant PvRII is an important step for structural studies as well as vaccine development.	2001 May	Singh S,Pandey K,Chattopadhayay R,Yazdani S S,Lynn A,Bharadwaj A,Ranjan A,Chitnis C	The Journal of biological chemistry. 276(20) 17111-6	Plasmodium Vivax duffy binding protein	DHKKTISSAIINHAFLQNTVMKNCNYKRKRRERDWDCNTKKDVCIPDRRYQLCMKELTNLVNNTDTNFHRDITFRKLYLKRKLIYDAAVEGDLLLKLNNYRYNKDFCKDIRWSLGDFGDIIMGTDMEGIGYSKVVENNLRSIFGTDEKAQQRRKQWWNESKAQIWTAMMYSVKKRLKGNFIWICKLNVAVNIEPQIYRWIREWGRDYVSELPTEVQKLKEKCDGKINYTDKKVCKVPPCQNACKSYDQWITRKKNQWDVLSNKFISVKNAEKVQTAGIVTPYDILKQELDEFNEVAFENEINKRDGAYIELCVCSVEEAKKNTQEVVT	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P22290			7.2	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16023369	Expression in Escherichia coli and disulfide bridge mapping of PSC33, an allergenic 2S albumin from peanut.	In this work, we describe the expression, purification, and disulfide mapping of the named &#39;peanut seed cDNA 33&#39; (PSC33) peanut allergen. A variant of PSC33 (with N(63), E(64), Q(69) instead of D(63), Q(64), E(69)) has been identified in peanut by proteomic analysis of a highly IgE immunoreactive purification fraction. It is 920mologous to Ara h 6. We raised monoclonal antibodies against PSC33 and amplified it by PCR from peanut leaf genomic DNA. PSC33 was intron-less and the two NEQ and DQE variants of PSC33 were equally amplified. Since expression of the natural PSC33 (DQE) gene was very low in Escherichia coli even with supplementation of rare codon tRNAs, a synthetic gene optimized for expression in E. coli of PSC33 (DQE) was introduced into a pET9-c vector. A high production of protein occurred in the inclusion bodies that was submitted to refolding using an additive-introduced stepwise dialysis protocol which consists in the gradual removal of the denaturing agent guanidine-HCl with controlled introduction of oxidized and reduced glutathione and l-arginine as a chemical chaperone. After reverse phase HPLC purification, 1mg of pure refolded protein (as assayed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, mouse IgG immunoreactivity and circular dichroism) were obtained with every 100ml of bacterial culture. Trypsin and CNBr hydrolysis of the protein combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry allowed us to assign disulfide bridges and show that the native and refolded proteins were identical. The four disulfides of canonical 2S albumins were conserved and the two supplementary cysteines of PSC33 were paired together.	2005 Dec	Clement Gilles,Boquet Didier,Mondoulet Lucie,Lamourette Patricia,Bernard Hervé,Wal Jean Michel	Protein expression and purification. 44(2) 110-20	PSC33 (Ara h 6)	MRRERGRQGDSSSCERQVDRVNLKPCEQHIMQRIMGEQEQYDSYDIRSTRSSDQQQRCCDELNEMENTQRCMCEALQQIMENQCDRLQDRQMVQQFKRELMNLPQQCNFRAPQRCDLDVSGGRC		Q647G9			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

However, the expression of the ADP/ATP carrier in bacteria retards their growth, and so the levels of expression that were attained were lower than those of the oxoglutarate carrier. The oxoglutarate carrier inclusion bodies have been disaggregated with the detergent N-dodecanoyl-sarcosine, and the protein has been incorporated into liposomes. In its ability to transport oxoglutarate and malate and other known substrates of the carrier in mitochondria, and in its inhibition characteristics by a wide range of non-competitive and competitive inhibitors, this reconstituted oxoglutarate carrier is similar to the natural protein in the inner membranes of mitochondria, and to the carrier that has been purified from mitochondria and reconstituted in liposomes. These experiments remove significant obstacles to crystallization trials and to site-directed mutagenesis of the oxoglutarate carrier.	1993 Aug	Fiermonte G,Walker J E,Palmieri F	The Biochemical journal. 294 ( Pt 1) 293-9	Mitochondrial oxoglutarate-malate carrier protein	AATASPGASGMDGKPRTSPKSVKFLFGGLAGMGATVFVQPLDLVKNRMQLSGEGAKTREYKTSFHALISILRAEGLRGIYTGLSAGLLRQATYTTTRLGIYTVLFERLTGADGTPPGFLLKAVIGMTAGATGAFVGTPAEVALIRMTADGRLPVDQRRGYKNVFNALFRIVQEEGVPTLWRGCIPTMARAVVVNAAQLASYSQSKQFLLDSGYFSDNILCHFCASMISGLVTTAASMPVDIVKTRIQNMRMIDGKPEYKNGLDVLVKVVRYEGFFSLWKGFTPYYARLGPHTVLTFIFLEQMNKAYKRLFLSG		P22292			7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12392553	Conformational analysis of opacity proteins from Neisseria meningitidis.	Opacity-associated (Opa) proteins are outer membrane proteins which play a critical role in the adhesion of pathogenic Neisseria spp. to epithelial and endothelial cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The adherence is mainly mediated by the CD66-epitope-containing members of the carcinoembryonic-antigen family of human cell-adhesion molecules (CEACAM). For the analysis of the specific interactions of individual Opa proteins with their receptors, pure protein is needed in its native conformation. In this study, we describe the isolation and structural analysis of opacity proteins OpaJ129 and OpaB128 derived from Neisseria meningitidis strain H44/76. When the Opa proteins were produced with the phoE signal sequence in Escherichia coli, they were localized at the cell surface and the recombinant bacteria were found to specifically interact with CEACAM1. For refolding and purification, the proteins were overproduced without their signal sequences in E. coli, resulting in its cytoplasmic accumulation in the form of inclusion bodies. After solubilization of the inclusion bodies in urea, the proteins could be folded efficiently in vitro, under alkaline conditions by dilution in ethanolamine and the detergent n-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-1-ammonio-3-propanesulfonate (SB12). The structure of the refolded and purified proteins, determined by circular dichroism, indicated a high content of beta-sheet conformation, which is consistent with previously proposed topology models for Opa proteins. A clear difference was found between the binding of refolded vs. denatured OpaJ protein to the N-A1 domain of CEACAM1. Almost no binding was found with the denatured Opa protein, showing that the Opa-receptor interaction is conformation-dependent.	2002 Nov	de Jonge Marien I,Bos Martine P,Hamstra Hendrik J,Jiskoot Wim,van Ulsen Peter,Tommassen Jan,van Alphen Loek,van der Ley Peter	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 269(21) 5215-23	Opacity protein B128	ASEDGSRSPYYVQADLAYAAERITHDYPKATGANNTSTVSDYFRNIRAHSIHPRVSVGYDFGGWRIAADYASYRKWNNNKYSVNTKELQKNNSSGIWQELKTENQENGTFHAASSLGLSAIYDFKLNDKFDKFKPYIGARVAYGHVKHQVHSVRKETTTTFSPPAQGATVPGKIVQGPTNKPAYHESNSISSLGLGVIAGVGFDITPKLTLDTGYRYHNWGRLENTRFKTHEVSLGMRYHF		O30756			12	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

15644217	Functional solubilization of aggregation-prone HIV envelope proteins by covalent fusion with chaperone modules.	The envelope proteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) mediate cell attachment and membrane fusion. For HIV-1, the precursor protein gp160 is cleaved proteolytically into two fragments, the surface-associated receptor binding subunit gp120 and the membrane spanning subunit gp41, which is involved in membrane fusion during virus entry. Soluble and immunoreactive variants of gp41 are essential for the reliable diagnosis of HIV-1 infections. Hitherto, gp41 was solubilized by adding detergents, or in acidic or alkaline solvents. We find that covalent fusions with SlyD or FkpA, two homodimeric Escherichia coli chaperones with peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity, solubilize retroviral envelope proteins without compromising their immunological reactivity. gp41 from HIV-1, gp36 from HIV-2 and gp21 from HTLV could be expressed in large amounts in the Escherichia coli cytosol when fused with one or two subunits of SlyD or FkpA. The fusion proteins could be easily isolated and refolded, and showed high solubility and immunoreactivity, thus providing sensitive and reliable tools for diagnostic applications. Covalent fusions with SlyD or FkpA might be valuable generic tools for the solubilization and activation of aggregation-prone proteins.	2005 Feb	Scholz Christian,Schaarschmidt Peter,Engel Alfred Michael,Andres Herbert,Schmitt Urban,Faatz Elke,Balbach Jochen,Schmid Franz Xaver	Journal of molecular biology. 345(5) 1229-41	gp41 ectodomain fragment	TLTVQARQLLSGIVQQQNNELRAIEAQQHLEQLTVWGTKQLQARELAVERYLKDQQLLGIWGCSGKLICTTAVPWNASWSNKSLEQIWNNMTWMEWDREINNYTSLIHSLIEESQNQQEKNEQELLELDKWASLWNWFNITNWLWY	N-terminal FkpA/SlyD and C-terminal Hexahistidine Tag	P03375			7.8	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

15208324	The three isoforms of the light-harvesting complex II: spectroscopic features, trimer formation, and functional roles.	The major light-harvesting complex (LHC-II) of higher plants plays a crucial role in capturing light energy for photosynthesis and in regulating the flow of energy within the photosynthetic apparatus. Native LHC-II isolated from plant tissue consists of three isoforms, Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and Lhcb3, which form homo- and heterotrimers. All three isoforms are highly conserved among different species, suggesting distinct functional roles. We produced the three LHC-II isoforms by heterologous expression of the polypeptide in Escherichia coli and in vitro refolding with purified pigments. Although Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 are very similar in polypeptide sequence and pigment content, Lhcb3 is clearly different because it lacks an N-terminal phosphorylation site and has a higher chlorophyll a/b ratio, suggesting the absence of one chlorophyll b. Low temperature absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of the pure isoforms revealed small but significant differences in pigment organization. The oligomeric state of the pure isoforms and of their permutations was investigated by native gel electrophoresis, sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and SDS-PAGE. Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 formed trimeric complexes by themselves and with one another, but Lhcb3 was able to do so only in combination with one or both of the other isoforms. We conclude that the main role of Lhcb1 and Lhcb2 is in the adaptation of photosynthesis to different light regimes. The most likely role of Lhcb3 is as an intermediary in light energy transfer from the main Lhcb1/Lhcb2 antenna to the photosystem II core.	2004 Aug	Standfuss Joerg,Kühlbrandt Werner	The Journal of biological chemistry. 279(35) 36884-91	Light harvesting complex II	RKTVAKPKGPSGSPWYGSDRVKYLGPFSGESPSYLTGEFPGDYGWDTAGLSADPETFARNRELEVIHSRWAMLGALGCVFPELLARNGVKFGEAVWFKAGSQIFSDGGLDYLGNPSLVHAQSILAIWATQVILMGAVEGYRVAGNGPLGEAEDLLYPGGSFDPLGLATDPEAFAELKVKELKNGRLAMFSMFGFFVQAIVTGKGPIENLADHLADPVNNNAWAFATNFVPGK	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P04777			9	4	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
15778505	Identification, evolution, and regulation of expression of Guinea pig trappin with an unusually long transglutaminase substrate domain.	Trappins are found in human, bovine, hippopotamus, and members of the pig family, but not in rat and mouse. To clarify the evolution of the trappin genes and the functional significance of their products, we isolated the trappin gene in guinea pig, a species belonging to a rodent family distinct from rat and mouse. Guinea pig trappin was confirmed to encode the same domain structure as trappin, consisting of a signal sequence, an extra large transglutaminase substrate domain, and a whey acidic protein motif. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization histochemistry as well as immunohistochemistry demonstrated that guinea pig trappin is expressed solely in the secretory epithelium of the seminal vesicle and that its expression is androgen-dependent. We confirmed that guinea pig trappin is cross-linked by prostate transglutaminase and that the whey acidic protein motif derived from guinea pig trappin has an inhibitory activity against leukocyte elastase. Genome sequence analysis showed that guinea pig trappin belongs to the family of REST (rapidly evolving seminal vesicle transcribed) genes.	2005 May	Furutani Yutaka,Kato Akira,Fibriani Azzania,Hirata Taku,Kawai Ryoji,Jeon Ju-Hong,Fujii Yasuhisa,Kim In-Gyu,Kojima Soichi,Hirose Shigehisa	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(21) 20204-15	trappin-2 (elafin)	AQEPVKGPVSTKPGSCPIILIRCAMLNPPNRCLKDTDCPGIKKCCEGSCGMACFVPQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P19957			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11437607	High-level expression of three members of the murine angiogenin family in Escherichia coli and purification of the recombinant proteins.	Angiogenin (Ang) is a small basic protein which belongs to the pancreatic ribonuclease superfamily. It potently induces the formation of new blood vessels and has emerged as a promising anticancer target. Mice possess genes encoding one ortholog (mAng) and three homologs of Ang, designated angiogenin-related protein (mAngrp), angiogenin-3 (mAng-3), and angiogenin-4 (mAng-4). Structural and functional study of these homologs has been hampered by the low yield of protein from the existing heterologous expression system. In the experiments described, we used a pET expression vector to express these proteins in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells, whereupon substantial amounts of each accumulated in the form of insoluble aggregates. The proteins were renatured using an arginine-assisted procedure and subsequently purified by cation-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC; each purified protein was shown to be enzymatically active toward tRNA. The yields of pure mAngrp and mAng-3 were 7.6 and 12 mg/liter culture, respectively, representing substantial increases over previously reported experiments. This is also the first report of the expression and purification of mAng-4, obtained here in a yield of 30 mg/liter culture. The ready availability of milligram quantities of these proteins will enable further functional studies and high-resolution structural analyses to be conducted.	2001 Jul	Holloway D E,Hares M C,Shapiro R,Subramanian V,Acharya K R	Protein expression and purification. 22(2) 307-17	Angiogenin-related protein	QDDSRYTKFLTQHYDAKPKGRDDRYCESMMVKRKLTSFCKDVNTFIHDTKNNIKAICGKKGSPYGRNLRISKSRFQVTTCTHKGRSPRPPCRYRASKGFRYIIIGCENGWPVHFDESFISP		Q64438			8	20	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

11827491	Binding of prion protein to lipid membranes and implications for prion conversion.	The binding of the Syrian hamster prion protein, SHaPrP(90-231), to model lipid membranes was investigated by tryptophan fluorescence. Membranes composed of negatively charged or zwitterionic lipids, and raft-like membranes containing dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine(1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), cholesterol and sphingomyelin, were investigated. It was found that SHaPrP(90-231) binds to negatively charged lipid membranes and raft-like membranes. Binding of PrP to negatively charged lipid membranes involves both electrostatic and hydrophobic lipid-protein interactions and results in partial insertion of PrP into the lipid bilayer. This membrane-inserted conformation of PrP is richer in beta-sheet structure and has a disruptive effect on the integrity of the lipid bilayer, leading to total release of vesicle contents. In contrast, the binding of PrP to raft-like membranes is driven by hydrophobic lipid-protein interactions and induces the formation of alpha-helical structure. This conformation of PrP with a high content of alpha-helix is formed only at pH 7 and does not destabilize the lipid bilayer. Our findings support the view that an interaction of PrP with lipid membranes could play a role in PrP conversion.	2002 Feb	Sanghera Narinder,Pinheiro Teresa J T	Journal of molecular biology. 315(5) 1241-56	Prion	KKRPKPGGWNTGGSRYPGQGSPGGNRYPPQGGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQGGGTHSQWNKPSKPKTNMKHMAGAAAAGAVVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPIIHFGSDYEDRYYRENMHRYPNQVYYRPMDEYSNQNNFVHDCVNITIKQHTVTTTTKGENFTETDVKMMERVVEQMCITQYERESQAYYQRGS		P04156			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
7721861	Expression, refolding, and autocatalytic proteolytic processing of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme precursor.	The interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme is a heterodimeric cysteine protease that is produced as a 45-kDa precursor. The full-length precursor form of the enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies. Following solubilization and refolding of the 45-kDa protein, autoproteolytic conversion to a heterodimeric form containing 10- and 20-kDa subunits was observed. This enzyme had catalytic activity against both natural (interleukin-1 beta precursor) and synthetic peptide substrates. The inclusion of a specific inhibitor (SDZ 223-941) of the converting enzyme in the refolding mixture prevented proteolytic processing to the 10-/20-kDa form. Similarly, refolding under nonreducing conditions also prevented processing. Time course experiments showed that the 10-kDa subunit was released from the 45-kDa precursor before the 20-kDa subunit, implying that the N-terminal portion of the precursor is released last and may play a regulatory role.	1995 Apr	Ramage P,Cheneval D,Chvei M,Graff P,Hemmig R,Heng R,Kocher H P,Mackenzie A,Memmert K,Revesz L	The Journal of biological chemistry. 270(16) 9378-83	Serum Retinol Binding Protein	ERDCRVSSFRVKENFDKARFSGTWYAMAKKDPEGLFLQDNIVAEFSVDETGQMSATAKGRVRLLNNWDVCADMVGTFTDTEDPAKFKMKYWGVASFLQKGNDDHWIVDTDYDTYAVQYSCRLLNLDGTCADSYSFVFSRDPNGLPPEAQKIVRQRQEELCLARQYRLIVHNGYCDGRSERNLL		P02753			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8702986	Stability and oligomeric equilibria of refolded interleukin-1beta converting enzyme.	We report the preparation and characterization of interleukin-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) refolded from its p20 and p10 protein fragments. Refolded ICE heterodimer (p20p10) was catalytically active but unstable, and in size exclusion chromatography eluted at an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa. The mechanisms of the observed instability were pH-dependent dissociation at low enzyme concentrations, and autolytic degradation of the p10 subunit at high concentrations. Binding and subsequent removal of a high affinity peptidic inhibitor increased the apparent molecular mass to 43 kDa (by size exclusion chromatography), and significantly increased its stability and specific activity. Chemical cross-linking and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the 43-kDa size exclusion chromatography conformer revealed a 60-kDa species, which was absent in the 30-kDa conformer, suggesting that inhibitor binding caused formation of a (p20p10)2 homodimer. The observation of a reversible equilibrium between ICE (p20p10) and (p20p10)2 suggests that analogous associations, possibly between ICE and ICE homologs, can occur in vivo, resulting in novel oligomeric protease species.	1996 Sep	Talanian R V,Dang L C,Ferenz C R,Hackett M C,Mankovich J A,Welch J P,Wong W W,Brady K D	The Journal of biological chemistry. 271(36) 21853-8	Interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme	MADKVLKEKRKLFIRSMGEGTINGLLDELLQTRVLNKEEMEKVKRENATVMDKTRALIDSVIPKGAQACQICITYICEEDSYLAGTLGLSADQTSGNYLNMQDSQGVLSSFPAPQAVQDNPAMPTSSGSEGNVKLCSLEEAQRIWKQKSAEIYPIMDKSSRTRLALIICNEEFDSIPRRTGAEVDITGMTMLLQNLGYSVDVKKNLTASDMTTELEAFAHRPEHKTSDSTFLVFMSHGIREGICGKKHSEQVPDILQLNAIFNMLNTKNCPSLKDKPKVIIIQACRGDSPGVVWFKDSVGVSGNLSLPTTEEFEDDAIKKAHIEKDFIAFCSSTPDNVSWRHPTMGSVFIGRLIEHMQEYACSCDVEEIFRKVRFSFEQPDGRAQMPTTERVTLTRCFYLFPGH		P29466			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

15380653	Refolding and purification of interferon-gamma in industry by hydrophobic interaction chromatography.	A new technology for renaturation with simultaneous purification of the recombinant human interferon-gamma (rhIFN-gamma) in downstream of biotechnology is presented. The strategies to develop the new technology in industry scale were suggested. Based on chemical equilibrium and molecular interactions, the principle of rhIFN-gamma refolding by HPHIC was described. The kind of stationary and mobile phases were evaluated and found the former to contribute to the rhIFN-gamma refolding more than the latter. The extract containing the rhIFN-gamma in gram scale in 7.0 mol L(-1) guanidine hydrochloride solution of 700 mL was directly pumped into a unit of simultaneous renaturation and purification of proteins (USRPP, 10 x 300 mm i.d.) packed by small particle packings of hydrophobic interaction chromatography and a satisfactory recovery of bioactivity and mass of the rhIFN-gamma was obtained. With flow rate 100 mL min(-1) and a gradient elution by only one step in 4h, the purity and specific bioactivity approach to 95% and 8.7 x 10(7) IU(-1) mg, respectively. To evaluate the goodness of the presented new technology in this study, a usual method with the renaturation by dilution method firstly and then purification with a series of LC in literature was employed to compare with each other. The obtained result in terms of purity, recoveries of mass and bioactivity, cost time as well as expenses, the former is much better than the latter. Comparing the total bioactivity of rhIFN-gamma in the extract before to that after the renaturation by the USRPP, the total bioactivity of rhIFN-gamma increased 62-fold.	2004 Sep	Geng Xindu,Bai Quan,Zhang Yangjun,Li Xiang,Wu Dan	Journal of biotechnology. 113(1-3) 137-49	Interferon gamma	QDPYVKEAENLKKYFNAGHSDVADNGTLFLGILKNWKEESDRKIMQSQIVSFYFKLFKNFKDDQSIQKSVETIKEDMNVKFFNSNKKKRDDFEKLTNYSVTDLNVQRKAIHELIQVMAELSPAAKTGKRKRSQMLFRG		P01579			7	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15171928	Purification of recombinant bovine normal prion protein PrP(104-242) by HPHIC.	Purification of the prion protein (PrP) is a major concern for biological or biophysical analysis as are the structural specificities of this protein in relation to infectivity. A simple and efficient method for purification of recombinant bovine normal prion protein containing residues 104-242, PrP(104-242) expressed in Escherichia coli by high performance hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HPHIC) was presented in this work. The solution containing denatured and reduced protein in 8.0 mol/L urea extracted from the inclusion body was directly injected into the HPHIC column, aggregates were prevented by the interaction between the denatured PrP(104-242) molecules and the stationary phase during the chromatographic process, the soluble form of PrP(104-242) in aqueous solution was obtained after desorbed from the column. Several factors, including pH value, types of stationary phase and salt, and gradient mode, influencing the purification results were investigated. Optimal conditions were obtained for the purification of PrP(104-242) by HPHIC. This procedure yield PrP(104-242) of a purity of 96% with a recovery of 87%, respectively, for a single step purification of 40 min.	2004 Jul	Wang Chaozhan,Geng Xindu,Wang Dawei,Tian Bo	Journal of chromatography.

14753769	Preparation of hydrophobic interaction chromatographic packings based on monodisperse poly(glycidylmethacrylate-co-ethylenedimethacrylate) beads and their application.	The monodisperse, poly(glycidylmethacrylate-co-ethylenedimethacrylate) beads with macroporous in the range of 8.0-12.0 microm were prepared by a single-step swelling and polymerization method. The seed particles prepared by dispersion polymerization exhibited good absorption of the monomer phase. The pore size distribution of the beads was evaluated by gel permeation chromatography and mercury instrusion method. Based on this media, a hydrophobic interaction chromatographic (HIC) stationary phase for HPLC was synthesized by a new chemically modified method. The prepared resin has advantages for biopolymer separation, high column efficiency, low column backpressure, high protein mass recovery and good resolution for proteins. The dynamic protein loading capacity of the synthesized HIC packings was 40.0 mg/ml. Six proteins were fast separated in less than 8.0 min using the synthesized HIC stationary phase. The HIC resin was firstly used for the purification and simultaneous renaturation of recombinant human interferon-gamma (rhIFN-gamma) in the extract solution containing 7.0 mol/l guanidine hydrochloride with only one step. The purity and specific bioactivity of the purified of rhIFN-gamma was found more than 95% and 1.3 x 10(8) IU/mg, respectively.	2004 Jan	Gong Bolin,Wang Lili,Wang Chaozhan,Geng Xindu	Journal of chromatography.

7529765	Refolding and reconstitution of functionally active complexes of human leukocyte antigen DR2 and myelin basic protein peptide from recombinant alpha and beta polypeptide chains.	Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are cell surface heterodimeric glycoproteins consisting of one alpha and one beta polypeptide chain of similar size. These molecules play a critical role in immune recognition by displaying processed antigens to CD4-positive T helper cells. Several attempts to express the MHC class II molecules by recombinant methods in various systems resulted in either failure or poor recovery of the intact heterodimer. The present study describes our successful effort to refold and reconstitute HLA DR2 heterodimer from individually expressed alpha and beta polypeptide chains lacking the transmembrane hydrophobic regions in Escherichia coli, in the presence of an immunodominant epitope analog from human myelin basic protein (b-MBP(83-102)Y83). The reconstituted DR2 heterodimer complex was selectively purified from unfolded alpha and beta chains using heterodimer-specific monoclonal antibody (L243) coupled to a solid support. The detection of two polypeptide chains in the purified refolded DR2-peptide complex preparations was accomplished by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using heterodimer- and chain-specific polyclonal antibodies, and the presence of equimolar amounts of both alpha chain and beta chain in the reconstituted complex preparation was confirmed by a double label experiment. The quantitation of the bound peptide in complex preparation was measured by incubating two chains in the presence of 125I-labeled peptide. An increase in the yield of refolded and reconstituted DR2-peptide complexes was observed with increasing peptide concentration in the reaction mixture. Finally, the functional activity of the reconstituted DR2 complexes was measured by their ability to stimulate gamma-interferon production by SS8T cloned T cells in an antigen-specific and dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that biologically active complexes of human DR2.b-MBP (83-102)Y83 can be prepared by proper folding of human leukocyte antigen DR2 alpha and beta chains in the presence of antigenic peptide. The yield of such DR2 heterodimers with bound peptide is several thousand-fold higher over native DR2 purified from transformed B cells. Since purified MHC class II-peptide complexes have been shown to prevent autoimmune diseases in various animal models, reconstituted heterodimer complexes may have significant clinical relevance in antigen-specific treatment of various autoimmune diseases. In addition, such complexes with increased yield will provide better understanding of the trimolecular interactions between MHC-peptide and T cell receptor.	1995 Jan	Arimilli S,Cardoso C,Mukku P,Baichwal V,Nag B	The Journal of biological chemistry. 270(2) 971-7	Human leukocyte antigen DR2 alpha chain	IKEEHVIIQAEFYLNPDQSGEFMFDFDGDEIFHVDMAKKETVWRLEEFGRFASFEAQGALANIAVDKANLEIMTKRSNYTPITNVPPEVTVLTNSPVELREPNVLICFIDKFTPPVVNVTWLRNGKPVTTGVSETVFLPREDHLFRKFHYLPFLPSTEDVYDCRVEHWGLDEPLLKHWEFDAPSPLPETTENVVCALGLTVGLVGIIIGTIFIIKGVRKSNAAERRGPL		P01903			7.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

8350395	Mutations that alter an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence in the adenovirus type 2 penton base protein abolish its cell-rounding activity and delay virus reproduction in flat cells.	The adenovirus penton base protein has a cell rounding activity and may lyse endosomes during virus entry into the cytoplasm. We found that penton base that was expressed in Escherichia coli also caused cell rounding and that cells adhered to polystyrene wells that were coated with the protein. Mutant analysis showed that both properties required an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence at residues 340 to 342 of penton base. In flat adherent cells, virus mutants with amino acid substitutions in the RGD sequence were delayed in virus reproduction and in the onset of viral DNA synthesis. In nonadherent or poorly spread cells, the kinetics of mutant virus reproduction were similar to those of wild-type adenovirus type 2. Expression of the mutant phenotype exclusively in the flat cells that we tested supports a model in which penton base interacts with an RGD-directed cell adhesion molecule during adenovirus uptake or uncoating.	1993 Sep	Bai M,Harfe B,Freimuth P	Journal of virology. 67(9) 5198-205	Penton base protein	MQRAAMYEEGPPPSYESVVSAAPVAAALGSPFDAPLDPPFVPPRYLRPTGGRNSIRYSELAPLFDTTRVYLVDNKSTDVASLNYQNDHSNFLTTVIQNNDYSPGEASTQTINLDDRSHWGGDLKTILHTNMPNVNEFMFTNKFKARVMVSRSLTKDKQVELKYEWVEFTLPEGNYSETMTIDLMNNAIVEHYLKVGRQNGVLESDIGVKFDTRNFRLGFDPVTGLVMPGVYTNEAFHPDIILLPGCGVDFTHSRLSNLLGIRKRQPFQEGFRITYDDLEGGNIPALLDVDAYQASLKDDTEQGGDGAGGGNNSGSGAEENSNAAAAAMQPVEDMNDHAIRGDTFATRAEEKRAEAEAAAEAAAPAAQPEVEKPQKKPVIKPLTEDSKKRSYNLISNDSTFTQYRSWYLAYNYGDPQTGIRSWTLLCTPDVTCGSEQVYWSLPDMMQDPVTFRSTSQISNFPVVGAELLPVHSKSFYNDQAVYSQLIRQFTSLTHVFNRFPENQILARPPAPTITTVSENVPALTDHGTLPLRNSIGGVQRVTITDARRRTCPYVYKALGIVSPRVLSSRTFGSGC		P03276			7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9765593	Cloning, expression, characterization and role of the leader sequence of a lipase from Rhizopus oryzae.	A lipase from Rhizopus oryzae DSM 853 (ROL) was cloned from a chromosomal gene bank, sequenced and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. ROL and its precursors ProROL and PreProROL were purified and their pH and temperature profile was determined. In contrast to ROL, ProROL and PreProROL had considerably higher thermostability and a slightly higher pH optimum. Moreover, it could be demonstrated by in vitro experiments that the natural leader sequence of ROL is able to inhibit the folding supporting properties of the prosequence, resulting in a retardation of folding. In addition, there is strong evidence that all different lipase forms derived from Rhizopus sp. described in the literature are a result of different proteolytic processing and originate from the same gene.	1998 Aug	Beer H D,McCarthy J E,Bornscheuer U T,Schmid R D	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1399(2-3) 173-80	Lipase from Rhizopus oryzae	MKKTAIAIAVALAGFATVAQAAPKDNTWYTGAKLGWSQYHSDGGKVVAATTAQIQEFTKYAGIAATAYCRSVVPGNKWDCVQCQKWVPDGKIITTFTSLLSDTNGYVLRSDKQKTIYLVFRGTNSFRSAITDIVFNFSDYKPVKGAKVHAGFLSSYEQVVNDYFPVVQEQLTAHPTYKVIVTGHSLGGAQALLAGMDLYQREPRLSPKNLSIFTVGGPRVGNPTFAYYVESTGIPFQRTVHKRDIVPHVPPQSFGFLHPGVESWIKSGTSNVQICTSEIETKDCSNSIVPFTSILDHLSYFDINEGSCL	PreProROL and ProROL also expressed and refolded, to investigate role or leader sequences.PreProROL:MKKTAIAIAVALAGFATVAQAAPKDNTWYTGAKLGWSQYHMVSFISISQG VSLCLLVSSM MLGSSAVPVS GKSGSSNTAV SASDNAALPP  50LISSRCAPPS NKGSKSDLQA EPYNMQKNTE WYESHGGNLT SIGKRDDNLV 100GGMTLDLPSD APPISLSSST NSASDGGKVV AATTAQIQEF TKYAGIAATA 150YCRSVVPGNK WDCVQCQKWV PDGKIITTFT SLLSDTNGYV LRSDKQKTIY 200LVFRGTNSFR SAITDIVFNF SDYKPVKGAK VHAGFLSSYE QVVNDYFPVV 250QEQLTAHPTY KVIVTGHSLG GAQALLAGMD LYQREPRLSP KNLSIFTVGG 300PRVGNPTFAY YVESTGIPFQ RTVHKRDIVP HVPPQSFGFL HPGVESWIKS 350GTSNVQICTS EIETKDCSNS IVPFTSILDH LSYFDINEGS CLNumber of amino acids: 432Molecular weight: 46372.5Theoretical pI: 8.30ProROL:MKKTAIAIAVALAGFATVAQAAPKDNTWYTGAKLGWSQYHAVPVS GKSGSSNTAV SASDNAALPP  50LISSRCAPPS NKGSKSDLQA EPYNMQKNTE WYESHGGNLT SIGKRDDNLV 100GGMTLDLPSD APPISLSSST NSASDGGKVV AATTAQIQEF TKYAGIAATA 150YCRSVVPGNK WDCVQCQKWV PDGKIITTFT SLLSDTNGYV LRSDKQKTIY 200LVFRGTNSFR SAITDIVFNF SDYKPVKGAK VHAGFLSSYE QVVNDYFPVV 250QEQLTAHPTY KVIVTGHSLG GAQALLAGMD LYQREPRLSP KNLSIFTVGG 300PRVGNPTFAY YVESTGIPFQ RTVHKRDIVP HVPPQSFGFL HPGVESWIKS 350GTSNVQICTS EIETKDCSNS IVPFTSILDH LSYFDINEGSNumber of amino acids: 405Molecular weight: 43597.0Theoretical pI: 8.37,N-terminal OmpA signal sequence	P61872			8.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9930674	Protein engineering of chimeric Serpins: an investigation into effects of the serpin scaffold and reactive centre loop length.	The exposed Serpin reactive centre loop controls the specificity of the serpin proteinase interaction. Mutations within this region have been used to generate novel potentially therapeutic inhibitors. In this study we examine the effect of the serpin scaffold and reactive centre loop length upon the generation of such inhibitors. The reactive centre loop regions, P7-P3&#39;, of alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin were replaced by the corresponding residues of the viral serpin, Serp1, to form AT/Serp1 and ACT/Serp1, respectively. AT/Serp1 formed SDS stable complexes with a range of proteinases with association rate constants for plasmin, tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, thrombin and factor Xa of approximately 10(4) M(-1)s(-1) and a stoichiometry of inhibition of approximately 1 for all of them. ACT/Serp1, however, formed SDS-stable complexes with only plasmin and thrombin with association rate constant 100-fold slower than AT/Serp1 and an increased stoichiometry of inhibition. The reactive centre loop of ACT/Serp1 is four amino acid residues longer than AT/Serp1. These four additional residues (VETR) were inserted into AT/Serp1 to form AT/Serp1(VETR). AT/Serp1(VETR) formed SDS stable complexes with plasmin, thrombin and tissue plasminogen activator similar to AT/Serp1, however, the association rate constants were 10-fold slower than those observed with AT/Serp1, while the stoichiometry of inhibition remained around 1. These results suggest that the additional reactive centre loop residues effect the rate of initial complex formation by placing the reactive centre loop in a non-ideal conformation. This study demonstrates that both reactive centre loop length and serpin scaffold are important in defining the inhibitory characteristics of a serpin.	1998 Dec	Bottomley S P,Stone S R	Protein engineering. 11(12) 1243-7	Alpha-1-Antitrypsin	EDPQGDAAQKTDTSHHDQDHPTFNKITPNLAEFAFSLYRQLAHQSNSTNIFFSPVSIATAFAMLSLGTKADTHDEILEGLNFNLTEIPEAQIHEGFQELLRTLNQPDSQLQLTTGNGLFLSEGLKLVDKFLEDVKKLYHSEAFTVNFGDTEEAKKQINDYVEKGTQGKIVDLVKELDRDTVFALVNYIFFKGKWERPFEVKDTEEEDFHVDQVTTVKVPMMKRLGMFNIQHCKKLSSWVLLMKYLGNATAIFFLPDEGKLQHLENELTHDIITKFLENEDRRSASLHLPKLSITGTYDLKSVLGQLGITKVFSNGADLSGVTEEAPLKLSKAVHKAVLTIDEKGTEAAGAMFLEAIPMSIPPEVKFNKPFVFLMIEQNTKSPLFMGKVVNPTQK		P01009			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

2647726	A 113-amino acid fragment of CD4 produced in Escherichia coli blocks human immunodeficiency virus-induced cell fusion.	A gene encoding a 113-amino acid, NH2-terminal fragment of CD4, rsT4.113, was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the tryptophan operon promoter. Following induction, rsT4.113 is produced at 5-100f total E. coli protein, and it is found in inclusion bodies. The protein is purified in two steps under denaturing and reducing conditions. Solubilized rsT4.113 is first purified on a column of Q-Sepharose to remove low molecular weight contaminants and then purified to greater than 950mogeneity by gel filtration. Renaturation of rsT4.113 is achieved at approximately 20% yield by dilution and dialysis. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of renatured rsT4.113 reveals a less than 15contaminant of reduced protein. Purified and renatured rsT4.113 contains epitopes for both OKT4a and Leu3a, anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies which block CD4-gp 120 association, but lacks measurable affinity toward a nonblocking anti-CD4 monoclonal antibody, OKT4. By comparison to a longer form (375 amino acids) of recombinant soluble T4 produced in mammalian cells that contains the entire extracellular domain, rsT4.113 has a comparable affinity for binding to OKT4a and Leu3a in a radioimmunoassay. Analysis of antiviral activity of rsT4.113 demonstrates that the E. coli-derived protein inhibits human immunodeficiency virus-induced syncytium formation with an IC50 of 5-10 micrograms/ml. These data demonstrate that the human immunodeficiency virus-binding domain of CD4 is localized within the NH2-terminal 113 amino acids of CD4 and is contained within a structure homologous to the kappa variable-like domain of immunoglobulins.	1989 Apr	Chao B H,Costopoulos D S,Curiel T,Bertonis J M,Chisholm P,Williams C,Schooley R T,Rosa J J,Fisher R A,Maraganore J M	The Journal of biological chemistry. 264(10) 5812-7	CD4	KKVVLGKKGDTVELTCTASQKKSIQFHWKNSNQIKILGNQGSFLTKGPSKLNDRADSRRSLWDQGNFPLIIKNLKIEDSDTYICEVEDQKEEVQLLVFGLTANSDTH		P01730		aa.1-107	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
2263618	Stability and activity of human immunodeficiency virus protease: comparison of the natural dimer with a homologous, single-chain tethered dimer.	A single-chain tethered dimer of human immunodeficiency virus protease (HIV-PR) was produced by expression of a synthetic gene in Escherichia coli. The tethered dimer, which consists of two 99-amino acid HIV-PR subunits linked together by a pentapeptide, was isolated from inclusion bodies and refolded as an active protease with enzymatic properties very similar to those of the natural dimer at pH 5.5. In addition to demonstrating that the tethered dimer is active, we have shown that the tethered dimer is more stable than the natural HIV-PR dimer at pH 7.0. This is attributed to dissociation of the natural HIV-PR dimer, for which a surprisingly high dissociation constant, 5 X 10(-8) M was measured. Furthermore, the tethered dimer offers an opportunity to produce asymmetric dimer mutants and thereby determine the effect of changes in one of the two subunits on protease activity. In one such mutant, a single active-site aspartic residue was changed to a glycine residue. This protein was inactive, consistent with a requirement for an aspartic residue from each subunit to constitute an active site of HIV-PR.	1990 Dec	Cheng Y S,Yin F H,Foundling S,Blomstrom D,Kettner C A	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 87(24) 9660-4	HIV protease	MEFMEDLAFLQGKAREFSSEQTRANSPTISSEQTRANSPTRRELQVWGRDNNSPSEAGADRQGTVSFNFPVTLWQRPLVTIKIGGQLKEALLGTGADDTVLEEMSLPGRWKPKMIGGIGGFIKVRQYDQILIEICGHKAIGTVLVGPTPVNIIGRNLLTQIGCTLNFPIGGSSGVTLWQRPLVTIKIGGQLKEALLDTGADDTVLEEMSLPGRWKPKMIGGIGGFIKVRQYDQILIEICGHKAIGTVLVGPTPVNIIGRNLLTQIGCTLNFPI	D25G mutation prevents autocleavage of leader sequence.

10049678	Expression in Escherichia coli, refolding, and purification of human procathepsin K, an osteoclast-specific protease.	We have constructed and optimized a high yielding Escherichia coli expression system to produce glycosylation-free human procathepsin K and have developed conditions for refolding this enzyme. Recombinant human procathepsin K (EC 3.4.22.38) was expressed in E. coli, refolded from inclusion bodies, and further purified by Superdex 75 size-exclusion chromatography. Purified procathepsin K had a [MH]+ of 35,063 Da which is in agreement with the predicted mass of the construct. Amino-terminal sequence analysis matched the predicted sequence with no secondary sequence detected. Purified procathepsin K activated under autocatalytic conditions to a final specific activity of 23 micromol 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin liberated/min/mg of enzyme using the fluorescent peptide substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanine-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin. This expression and refolding procedure yielded 50 mg of purified, glycosylation-free human procathepsin K from 1 liter of E. coli cell culture and enabled the determination of the structure of human procathepsin K at 2.6 A resolution.	1999 Mar	D&#39;alessio K J,McQueney M S,Brun K A,Orsini M J,Debouck C M	Protein expression and purification. 15(2) 213-20	ProCathepsin K	MEEILDTHWELWKKTHRKQYNNKVDEISRRLIWEKNLKYISIHNLEASLGVHTYELAMNHLGDMTSEEVVQKMTGLKVPLSHSRSNDTLYIPEWEGRAPDSVDYRKKGYVTPVKNQGQCGSCWAFSSVGALEGQLKKKTGKLLNLSPQNLVDCVSENDGCGGGYMTNAFQYVQKNRGIDSEDAYPYVGQEESCMYNPTGKAAKCRGYREIPEGNEKALKRAVARVGPVSVAIDASLTSFQFYSKGVYYDESCNSDNLNHAVLAVGYGIQKGNKHWIIKNSWGENWGNKGYILMARNKNNACGIANLASFPKM		P43235			10.7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	t	f	f	f
3552045	Structure of human tumor necrosis factor alpha derived from recombinant DNA.	Recombinant DNA derived tumor necrosis factor alpha, when expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli, appeared in the pellet and soluble fractions of disrupted cells. The protein was purified from the pellet fraction by solubilizing it in urea and reducing agent and was refolded into a buffer without these additives. The structure of the protein was identical with that purified from the soluble fraction without exposure to both reducing and denaturing agents, as demonstrated by circular dichroism, gel filtration, and sulfhydryl titration. As a reflection of the structural similarity, both purified proteins showed identical cytolytic activity on mouse L929 cells. The protein was characterized as an essentially nonhelical and beta-sheet-rich structure and possibly as a noncovalently associating oligomer. Two cysteine residues form an intrapolypeptide disulfide bond.	1987 Mar	Davis J M,Narachi M A,Alton N K,Arakawa T	Biochemistry. 26(5) 1322-6	Tumor necrosis factor alpha	MSTESMIRDVELAEEALPKKTGGPQGSRRCLFLSLFSFLIVAGATTLFCLLHFGVIGPQREEFPRDLSLISPLAQAVRSSSRTPSDKPVAHVVANPQAEGQLQWLNRRANALLANGVELRDNQLVVPSEGLYLIYSQVLFKGQGCPSTHVLLTHTISRIAVSYQTKVNLLSAIKSPCQRETPEGAEAKPWYEPIYLGGVFQLEKGDRLSAEINRPDYLDFAESGQVYFGIIAL		P01375			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
1290165	Bacterial expression, purification, and partial characterization of amino acids 94-155 of human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) as an inhibitor of blood coagulation factor Xa.	Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a plasma-derived protein which inhibits two of the active serine proteases present during normal blood coagulation. Inhibition of both of these proteases, factors VIIa and Xa, is thought to require a factor Xa-TFPI complex. To begin to investigate the interactions between factor Xa and TFPI, amino acids 94-155, which encode for the second Kunitz domain (K2) of TFPI, were expressed, purified, and partially characterized. Expression of the recombinant peptide was accomplished using an E. coli expression system which produced the peptide at an expression level of approximately 2-50f total cell protein. The peptide was localized to disulfide-linked refractile bodies which were solubilized by reduction in the presence of denaturant and the soluble protein refolded. Oxidized K2 was purified from the refold mixture using a two-step procedure employing gel filtration chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The unprocessed form of the recombinant peptide, Met-Ala-K2 (rMA-K2), was characterized. This peptide was purified to apparent homogeneity as determined by SDS-PAGE, quantitative amino acid, Edman degradation, and electrospray mass spectrometry analyses (&gt; 95d0c850ure). The product bound to factor Xa covalently coupled to a solid support in the presence of 2M sodium chloride demonstrating its affinity for this enzyme. Preincubation of rMA-K2 peptide with factor Xa neutralized, with 1.1:1 stoichiometry, the ability of factor Xa to hydrolyze a small chromogenic substrate. Additionally, rMA-K2 prolonged the time to clot formation in a plasma-based assay dependent on factor Xa concentration. Finally, this peptide mildly prolonged the prothrombin and modified prothrombin times of normal pooled plasma. Taken together this data demonstrates that this region of TFPI inhibits factor Xa activity and allows for further characterization of this enzyme-inhibitor complex.	1992 Dec	Day K C,Welsch D J	Thrombosis research. 68(4-5) 369-81	Tissue factor pathway inhibitor	MAPDFCFLEEDPGICRGYITRYFYNNQTKQCERFKYGGCLGNMNNFETLEECKNICEDGPNGFQ		P10646		Kunitz 2 domain	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1856233	Single-chain site-specific mutations of fluorescein-amino acid contact residues in high affinity monoclonal antibody 4-4-20.	Previous crystallographic studies of high affinity anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody 4-4-20 (Ka = 1.7 x 10(10) M-1) complexed with fluorescyl ligand resolved active site contact residues involved in binding. For better definition of the relative roles of three light chain antigen contact residues (L27dhis, L32tyr and L34arg), four site-specific mutations (L27dhis to L27lys, L32tyr to L32phe, and L34arg to L34lys and L34his) were generated and expressed in single-chain antigen binding derivatives of monoclonal antibody 4-4-20 containing two different polypeptide linkers (SCA 4-4-20/205c, 25 amino acids and SCA 4-4-20/212, 14 amino acids). Results showed that L27dhis and L32tyr were necessary for wild type binding affinities, however, were not required for near-wild type Qmax values (where Qmax is the maximum fluoroscein fluorescence quenching expressed as percent). Tyrosine L32 which hydrogen bonds with ligand was also characterized at the haptenic level through the use of 9-hydroxyphenylfluoron which lacks the carboxyl group to which L32 tyrosine forms a hydrogen bond. Results demonstrated that wild type SCA and mutant L32phe possessed similar HPF binding characteristics. Active site contact residue L34arg was important for fluorescein quenching maxima and binding affinity (L34his mutant), however, substitution of lysine for arginine at L34 did not have a significant effect on observed Qmax value. In addition, substitutions had no effect on structural and topological characteristics, since all mutants retained similar idiotypic and metatypic properties. Finally, two linkers were comparatively examined to determine relative contributions to mutant binding properties and stability. No linker effects were observed. Collectively, these results verified the importance of these light chain fluorescein contact residues in the binding pocket of monoclonal antibody 4-4-20.	1991 Jul	Denzin L K,Whitlow M,Voss E W	The Journal of biological chemistry. 266(21) 14095-103	Single chain monoclonal antibody 4-4-20					None	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9860866	Substrates and inhibitors of human T-cell leukemia virus type I protease.	HTLV-I is an oncogenic retrovirus that is associated with adult T-cell leukemia. HTLV-I protease and HTLV-I protease fused to a deca-histidine containing leader peptide (His-protease) have been cloned, expressed, and purified. The refolded proteases were active and exhibited nearly identical enzymatic activities. To begin to characterize the specificity of HTLV-I, we measured protease cleavage of peptide substrates and inhibition by protease inhibitors. HTLV-I protease cleavage of a peptide representing the HTLV-I retroviral processing site P19/24 (APQVLPVMHPHG) yielded Km and kcat values of 470 microM and 0.184 s-1 while cleavage of a peptide representing the processing site P24/15 (KTKVLVVQPK) yielded Km and kcat values of 310 microM and 0.0060 s-1. When the P1&#39; proline of P19/24 was replaced with p-nitro-phenylalanine (Nph), the ability of HTLV-I protease to cleave the substrate (APQVLNphVMHPL) was improved. Inhibition of HTLV-I protease and His-protease by a series of protease inhibitors was also tested. It was found that the Ki values for inhibition of HTLV-I protease and His-protease by a series of pepsin inhibitors ranged from 7 nM to 10 microM, while the Ki values of a series of HIV-1 protease inhibitors ranged from 6 nM to 127 microM. In comparison, the Ki values for inhibition of pepsin by the pepsin inhibitors ranged from 0.72 to 19.2 nM, and the Ki values for inhibition of HIV-1 protease by the HIV protease inhibitors ranged from 0.24 nM to 1.0 microM. The data suggested that the substrate binding site of HTLV-I protease is different from the substrate binding sites of pepsin and HIV-1 protease, and that currently employed HIV-1 protease inhibitors would not be effective for the treatment of HTLV-I infections.	1998 Dec	Ding Y S,Rich D H,Ikeda R A	Biochemistry. 37(50) 17514-8	Human T-cell leukemia virus type I protease	MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIDDDKHMLEDPVIPLDPARRPVIKAQVDTQTSHPKTIEALLDTGADMTVLPIALFSSNTPLKNTSVLGAGGQTQDHFKLTSLPVLIRLPFRTTPIVLTSCLVDTKNNWAIIGRDALQQCQGVLYLPEAKGPPVIL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P10274			3.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
7749064	Multifunctional regulation of the biological effects of TNF-alpha by the soluble type I and type II TNF receptors.	Two soluble receptors of tumour necrosis factor were evaluated for development as potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory disease. The recombinant human soluble Type I and Type II TNF receptors, rsTNF-RI and rsTNF-RII, were expressed at high levels in E. coli, refolded, and chromatographically purified to homogeneity. The potencies of both recombinant soluble receptors were similar to their naturally occurring soluble receptors. In in vitro cytotoxicity and competitive binding assays, both recombinant soluble receptors functioned to inhibit the biological effects of rhTNF-alpha although rsTNF-RI was a 5 to 30 fold more potent inhibitor of rhTNF-alpha than was rsTNF-RII or a truncated form of the soluble receptor, TNF-RII delta. In in vivo experiments in mice, rsTNF-RI was a better inhibitor than rsTNF-RII delta of rhTNF-alpha-stimulated changes in the percentages of circulating lymphocytes and neutrophils, influx of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity, and serum IL-6 induction. At molar ratios of 0.1:1 and 0.01:1 (rsTNF-R:rhTNF-alpha), using the rsTNF-I or rsTNF-II delta, there was a trend towards enhancement of the induction of IL-6. However, higher ratios of either rsTNF-RI or rsTNF-RII delta significantly inhibited the rhTNF-alpha-stimulated increase in serum IL-6 levels. In a murine model of cytokine-induced shock, either rsTNF-RI or rsTNF-RII delta provided protection against the lethality of shock induced by a synergistic combination of rhTNF-alpha and rhIL-1 beta.

Mouse Gal beta 1,4GlcNAc alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase was produced in an insoluble form in Escherichia coli cells harboring expression plasmids. The insoluble protein was solubilized with 8 M urea and diluted for renaturation of the enzyme. The substrate specificity and kinetic parameters, except for the specific activity, of the renatured enzyme were similar to those of the enzyme obtained from rat liver. These results suggest that a bacterial expression system is a potentially powerful tool for the large scale production of sialyltransferases and for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of sialyltransferases.	1994 Feb	Hamamoto T,Lee Y C,Kurosawa N,Nakaoka T,Kojima N,Tsuji S	Bioorganic &amp; medicinal chemistry. 2(2) 79-84	Beta galactoside alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase	MGSDYEALTLQAKVFQMPKSQEKVAVGPAPQAVFSNSKQDPKEGVQILSYPRVTAKVKPQPSLQVWDKDSTYSKLNPRLLKIWRNYLNMNKYKVSYKGPGPGVKFSVEALRCHLRDHVNVSMIEATDFPFNTTEWEGYLPKENFRTKAGPWHKCAVVSSAGSLKNSQLGREIDNHDAVLRFNGAPTDNFQQDVGTKTTIRLVNSQLVTTEKRFLKDSLYTEGILILWDPSVYHADIPQWYQKPDYNFFETYKSYRRLHPSQPFYILKPQMPWELWDIIQEISPDLIQPNPPSSGMLGIIIMMTLCDQVDIYEFLPSKRKTDVCYYHQKFFDSACTMGAYHPLLFEKNMVKHLNEGTDEDIYLFGKATLSGFRNNRC		Q8K1L1			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

1868081	Refolded HIV-1 tat protein protects both bulge and loop nucleotides in TAR RNA from ribonucleolytic cleavage.	Substantial evidence indicates that HIV-1 trans-activation by tat protein is mediated through the TAR RNA element. This RNA forms a stem-loop structure containing a three-nucleotide bulge and a six-nucleotide loop. Previous mutagenic analysis of TAR indicates that the bulge residues and a 4 bp segment of the stem constitute, in part, the tat binding site. However, there appears to be no sequence-specific contribution of the six-base loop. We have employed a ribonuclease protection technique to explore the interaction of tat with single-stranded regions of TAR. The results indicate that tat interacts with both the bulge and loop regions of TAR. Treatment of TAR RNA with RNase A results in cleavage at U23 and U31, located in the bulge and loop regions, respectively. High concentrations (approximately 2 microM) of Escherichia coli derived tat protein, prepared by standard procedures, gave complete protection of TAR RNA from RNase A cleavage. However, under these conditions, truncated TAR derivatives in which no stem-loop structure is expected to form were also protected, indicating nonspecific binding. In order to obtain a tat preparation with enhanced specificity toward TAR RNA, methods were developed for refolding the recombinant protein. This treatment enhanced the affinity of tat for TAR by approximately 30-fold [Kd(apparent) less than 25 nM] and markedly increased its specificity for the TAR. Again, tat protected TAR RNA from RNase A cleavage at both U23 and U31. Protection was also observed with RNase T1 which cleaves TAR RNA at three G residues in the six-base loop.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1991 Aug	Harper J W,Logsdon N J	Biochemistry. 30(32) 8060-6	HIV tat protein	MEPVDPRLEPWKHPGSQPKTACTNCYCKKCCFHCQVCFITKALGISYGRKKRRQRRRAPQGSQTHQVSLSKQPTSQSRGDPTGPKE		P04326			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9632658	Novel recombinant analogues of bovine placental lactogen. G133K and G133R provide a tool to understand the difference between the action of prolactin and growth hormone receptors.	Two new analogues of bovine placental lactogen (bPL), bPL(G133K) and bPL(G133R), were expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified to a native form. Binding experiments, which are likely to represent the binding to site 1 only, to intact FDC-P1 cells transfected with rabbit (rb) growth hormone receptor (GHR) or with human (h) GHR, to Nb2 rat lymphoma cells, or to rabbit mammary gland membranes prolactin receptor (PRLR), revealed only small or no reduction in binding capacity. The complex formation between these analogues and receptor extracellular domains (R-ECD) of various hormones was determined by gel filtration. Wild type bPL yielded 1:2 complex with hGHR-ECD, rat PRLR-ECD, and rbPRLR-ECD, whereas both analogues formed only 1:1 complexes with all R-ECDs tested. Real time kinetics experiments demonstrated that the ability of the analogues to form homodimeric complexes was compromised in both PRLR- and GHR-ECDs. The biological activity transduced through lactogenic receptors in in vitro bioassays in rabbit mammary gland acini culture and in Nb2 cells was almost fully retained, whereas the activity transduced through somatogenic receptors in FDC-P1 cells transfected with rbGHRs or with hGHRs was abolished. Both analogues exhibited antagonistic activity in the latter cells. To explain the discrepancy between the effect of the mutation on the signal transduced by PLR versus GHRs we suggest that: 1) the mutation impairs the ability of site 2 of bPL to form a stable homodimeric complex with both lactogenic and somatogenic receptors by a drastic shortening of the half-life of 2:1 complex; 2) the transient existence of the homodimeric complex is still sufficient to initiate the signal transduced through lactogenic receptors but not through somatogenic receptors; and 3) one possible reason for this difference is that JAK2, which serves as a mediator of both receptors, is already associated with lactogenic receptors prior to hormone binding-induced receptor dimerization, whereas in somatogenic receptors the JAK2 receptor association occurs subsequently to receptor dimerization.	1998 Jun	Helman D,Staten N R,Grosclaude J,Daniel N,Nespoulous C,Djiane J,Gertler A	The Journal of biological chemistry. 273(26) 16067-74	Placental lactogen	MAPASSHRGHQWICDLVRGSCLLLLLVVSNLLLCQGVEDYAPYCKNQPGNCRIPLQSLFERATLVASNNYRLAREMFNEFNKQFGEGKNFTSKVINSCHTEFMTTPNNKEAAANTEDEALLRLVISLLHSWDEPLHQAVTELLHRNGASPDILARAKEIEDKTKVLLEGVEMIQKRVHPGEKKNEPYPVWSEKSSLTADDEDVRQTAFYRMFHCLHRDSSKISTYINLLKCRFTPC	According to UniProt entry, aa.1-36 is a signal sequenceIn this study, two analogues: G133K and G133R expressed and purified.

1569054	Purification and characterization of a functionally homogeneous 60-kDa species of the retinoblastoma gene product.	The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB) encodes a 928-amino acid protein (pRB) that is hypothesized to function in a pathway that restricts cell proliferation. The immortalizing proteins from three distinct DNA tumor viruses (SV40 large T antigen, adenovirus E1a, and human papilloma virus Type 16 E7) have been shown to interact with RB protein through two noncontiguous regions comprised of amino acids 393-572 (domain A) and 646-772 (domain B). We constructed a truncated form of RB (RB p60) that retains these two domains but eliminates the N-terminal 386 amino acids of RB. RB p60 was expressed in Escherichia coli in inclusion bodies. After solubilization, it was refolded in the presence of magnesium chloride, and the active protein was isolated with an E7 peptide affinity column. The protein that elutes from this column is functionally homogenous in its ability to bind immobilized E7 protein. Thermal denaturation studies provide additional evidence for the conformational homogeneity of the isolated protein. This purification scheme allows the isolation of significant amounts of RB p60 protein that is suitable for structural and functional studies.	1992 Apr	Edwards G M,Huber H E,DeFeo-Jones D,Vuocolo G,Goodhart P J,Maigetter R Z,Sanyal G,Oliff A,Heimbrook D C	The Journal of biological chemistry. 267(12) 7971-4	Retinoblastoma-associated protein	MTMITPSLHALVMILNSASDQPSENLISYFNNCTVNPKESILKRVKDIGYIFKEKFAKAVGQGCVEIGSQRYKLGVRLYYRVMESMLKSEEERLSIQNFSKLLNDNIFHMSLLACALEVVMATYSRSTSQNLDSGTDLSFPWILNVLNLKAFDFYKVIESFIKAEGNLTREMIKHLERCEHRIMESLAWLSDSPLFDLIKQSKDREGPTDHLESACPLNLPLQNNHTAADMYLSPVRSPKKKGSTTRVNSTANAETQATSAFQTQKPLKSTSLSLFYKKVYRLAYLRLNTLCERLLSEHPELEHIIWTLFQHTLQNEYELMRDRHLDQIMMCSMYGICKVKNIDLKFKIIVTAYKDLPHAVQETFKRVLIKEEEYDSIIVFYNSVFMQRLKTNILQYASTRPPTLSPIPHIPRSPYKFPSSPLRIPGGNIYISPLKSPYKISEGLPTPTKMTPRSRILVSIGESFGTSEKFQKINQMVCNSDRVLKRSAEGSNPPKPLKKLRFDIEGSDEADGSKHLPGESKFQQKLAEMTSTRTRMQKQKMNDSMTSNKEEK	12 extra N-terminal residues added from expression vector	P06400		N-terminally truncated construct, domains A and B (aa.387-928)	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8692965	Direct binding of a soluble natural killer cell inhibitory receptor to a soluble human leukocyte antigen-Cw4 class I major histocompatibility complex molecule.	Natural killer (NK) cells expressing specific p58 NK receptors are inhibited from lysing target cells that express human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C class I major histocompatibility complex molecules. To investigate the interaction between p58 NK receptors and HLA-Cw4, the extracellular domain of the p58 NK receptor specific for HLA-Cw4 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and refolded from purified inclusion bodies. The refolded NK receptor is a monomer in solution. It interacts specifically with HLA-Cw4, blocking the binding of a p58-Ig fusion protein to HLA-Cw4-expressing cells, but does not block the binding of a p58-Ig fusion protein specific for HLA-Cw3 to HLA-Cw3-expressing cells. The bacterially expressed extracellular domain of HLA-Cw4 heavy chain and beta2-microglobulin were refolded in the presence of a HLA-Cw4-specific peptide. Direct binding between the soluble p58 NK receptor and the soluble HLA-Cw4-peptide complex was observed by native gel electrophoresis. Titration binding assays show that soluble monomeric receptor forms a 1:1 complex with HLA-Cw4, independent of the presence of Zn2+. The formation of complexes between soluble, recombinant molecules indicates that HLA-Cw4 is sufficient for specific ligation by the NK receptor and that neither glycoprotein requires carbohydrate for the interaction.	1996 Jul	Fan Q R,Garboczi D N,Winter C C,Wagtmann N,Long E O,Wiley D C	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 93(14) 7178-83	p58 natural killer cell inhibitory receptor	HEGVHRKPSLLAHPGPLVKSEETVILQCWSDVMFEHFLLHREGMFNDTLRLIGEHHDGVSKANFSISRMTQDLAGTYRCYGSVTHSPYQVSAPSDPLDIVIIGLYEKPSLSAQPGPTVLAGENVTLSCSSRSSYDMYHLSREGEAHERRLPAGPKVNGTFQADFPLGPATHGGTYRCFGSFHDSPYEWSKSSDPLLVSVT	Two extracellular domain constructs expressed and refolded:2) sol-cl42H: a.a.1-224HEGVHRKPS LLAHPGPLVK SEETVILQCW  50SDVMFEHFLL HREGMFNDTL RLIGEHHDGV SKANFSISRM TQDLAGTYRC 100YGSVTHSPYQ VSAPSDPLDI VIIGLYEKPS LSAQPGPTVL AGENVTLSCS 150SRSSYDMYHL SREGEAHERR LPAGPKVNGT FQADFPLGPA THGGTYRCFG 200SFHDSPYEWS KSSDPLLVSV TGNPSNSWPS PTEPSSKTGN PRHLHNumber of amino acids: 224Molecular weight: 24608.4Theoretical pI: 6.26	P43626			8.3	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

8276879	Characterization and crystallization of recombinant human neurotrophin-4.	Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) is the most recently discovered member of the neurotrophin family. We have expressed, refolded, and purified recombinant human NT-4 from Escherichia coli and compared it with recombinant human NT-4 secreted into the culture medium of baculovirus-infected insect cells. Both preparations were characterized and determined to be indistinguishable according to several biochemical criteria. Recombinant NT-4 from E. coli was crystallized in a form suitable for x-ray analysis, and characterization of these crystals indicated that NT-4 was present as a dimer within the asymmetric unit. NT-4 was active in promoting the survival of rat TrkB receptor-expressing fibroblasts, but was inactive on embryonic chicken sensory neurons, unlike the other members of the neurotrophin family and in contrast to the reported activities of partially purified NT-4.	1994 Jan	Fandl J P,Tobkes N J,McDonald N Q,Hendrickson W A,Ryan T E,Nigam S,Acheson A,Cudny H,Panayotatos N	The Journal of biological chemistry. 269(1) 755-9	Neurotrophin-4/Neurotrophin-5	GVSETAPASRRGELAVCDAVSGWVTDRRTAVDLRGREVEVLGEVPAAGGSPLRQYFFETRCKADNAEEGGPGAGGGGCRGVDRRHWVSECKAKQSYVRALTADAQGRVGWRWIRIDTACVCTLLSRTGRA	Full mature protein (without pre-pro sequence) expressed and refolded.

15659452	The rice nucellin gene ortholog OsAsp1 encodes an active aspartic protease without a plant-specific insert and is strongly expressed in early embryo.	The barley nucellin gene was reported to be nucellus specific in its expression and was hypothesized to play a role in the programmed cell death of the nucellus as an aspartic protease. Here we provide direct evidence that the rice ortholog encodes an active aspartic protease, but we prefer the name aspartic protease1 (OsAsp1) to nucellin after a detailed analysis of its expression pattern in rice and barley. Northern blots, RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization showed that OsAsp1 is expressed most abundantly in zygotic embryos 1-2 d after fertilization. It is also expressed in pollen, nucellus, ovary wall, shoot and root meristem, coleoptiles of immature seeds, and somatic embryos. A parallel study in barley showed that the barley nucellin gene was expressed not only in the nucellus but also strongly in embryos. Recombinant protein proOsAsp1 expressed in the bacterium Escherichia coli refolded and autolysed at acidic pH 3.5 in vitro, and the mature peptide displayed protease activity. Nucellin has three close homologs in rice on chromosomes 11 and 12 and in Arabidopsis on chromosomes 1 and 4. They lack the plant-specific insert that distinguishes the typical plant aspartic protease from aspartic proteases of other organisms. They constitute a new class of aspartic protease that is present in both monocots and dicots but whose function remains to be explored further.	2005 Jan	Bi Xuezhi,Khush Gurdev S,Bennett John	Plant &amp; cell physiology. 46(1) 87-98	Aspartyl protease	PAKPYFLDIDTGSTLTWLQCDYPCINCNKVPHGLYKPELKYAVKCTEQRCADLYADLRKPMKCGPKNQCHYGIQYVGGSSIGVLIVDSFSLPASNGTNPTSIAFGCGYNQGKNNHNVPTPVNGILGLGRGKVTLLSQLKSQGVITKHVLGHCISSKGKGFLFFGDAKVPTSGVTWSPMNREHKHYSPRQGTLQFNSNSKPISAAPMEVIFDSGATYTYFALQPYHATLSVVKSTLSKECKFLTEVKEKDRALTVCWKGKDKIRTIDEVKKCFRSLSLKFADGDKKATLEIPPEHYLIISQEGHVCLGILDGSKEHPSLAGTNLIGGITMLDQMVIYDSERSLLGWVNYQCDRIPRSASAITSRL	N-terminal thioredoxin + hexahistidine tag	A2ZC67			3.5	22	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8428649	Recombinant carp (Cyprinus carpio) growth hormone: expression, purification, and determination of biological activity in vitro and in vivo.	Carp growth hormone (cGH) cDNA (Koren et al., 1989) was cloned under the control of lambda-phage PLOL promoter and lambda cll ribosomal binding site into pBR322 plasmid to enable its expression in Escherichia coli A1645 that produces constitutively the thermolabile lambda repressor c1857. Temperature shift to 42 degrees abolished the repression, resulting in a high level of cGH expression. The bacterially expressed cGH protein, contained within the refractile body pellet, was solubilized in 4.5 M urea, refolded, and purified on Q-Sepharose column by stepwise elution with NaCl. The bioactive fraction was eluted at 0.2 M NaCl at a yield of 10-15%. This fraction contained predominantly (95%) 21.5-kDa monomeric cGH. The activity of cGH in vitro was bioassayed using Nb2-11C lymphoma cells (containing lactogenic receptors) and 3T3-F442A preadipocyte cells (containing somatogenic receptors). Bioactivity was found to be 0.01 and 6-10% that of human GH, respectively. In vivo cGH activity was measured by weekly ip injection in juvenile carp fed a low (23%) protein diet. Over a 6-week period, cGH increased the growth rate by 38compared to fish injected with vehicle only. Identical injections with bovine GH yielded only a 21 0ncrease.	1993 Jan	Fine M,Sakal E,Vashdi D,Daniel V,Levanon A,Lipshitz O,Gertler A	General and comparative endocrinology. 89(1) 51-61	Growth Hormone	MARVLVLLSVVLVSLLVNQGRASDNQRLFNNAVIRVQHLHQLAAKMINDFEDSLLPEERRQLSKIFPLSFCNSDYIEAPAGKDETQKSSMLKLLRISFHLIESWEFPSQSLSGTVSNSLTVGNPNQLTEKLADLKMGISVLIQACLDGQPNMDDNDSLPLPFEDFYLTMGENNLRESFRLLACFKKDMHKVETYLRVANCRRSLDSNCTL		P10298			11.3	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
2142945	Purification and biochemical characterization of a soluble human interferon gamma receptor expressed in Escherichia coli.	We purified and characterized a soluble human interferon gamma receptor expressed in Escherichia coli. The soluble receptor comprises the amino acids 15-246 of the encoded protein (Aguet, M., Dembic, Z., and Merlin, G. (1988) Cell 55, 273-280) and was purified from large scale fermentations through four chromatographic steps with an overall recovery of 28%. The refolded soluble receptor shows some heterogeneity on nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, where it appears as the major band of 27 kDa molecular mass, accompanied by a few minor bands with molecular masses between 26 and 30 kDa. On reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis it appears as a homogeneous protein of 32 kDa molecular mass. The soluble interferon gamma receptor is an active and stable protein and is recognized by specific antibodies raised against the native receptor. When nonreduced it has the capacity to specifically bind interferon gamma and to compete for the binding of interferon gamma to the cell surface receptor. The observed heterogeneity of the soluble interferon gamma receptor under nonreducing electrophoretic conditions is probably due to different conformational forms resulting from the formation of non-native intramolecular disulfide bonds among the 8 cysteine residues present in the soluble interferon gamma receptor molecule.	1990 Aug	Fountoulakis M,Juranville J F,Stüber D,Weibel E K,Garotta G	The Journal of biological chemistry. 265(22) 13268-75	Interferon gamma receptor	MRGRAEMGTADLGPSSVPTPTNVTIESYNMNPIVYWEYQIMPQVPVFTVEVKNYGVKNSEWIDACINISHHYCNISDHVGDPSNSLWVRVKARVGQKESAYAKSEEFAVCRDGKIGPPKLDIRKEEKQIMIDIFHPSVFVNGDEQEVDYDPETTCYIRVYNVYVRMNGSEIQYKILTQKEDDCDEIQCQLAIPVSSLNSQYCVSAEGVLHVWGVTTEKSKEVCITIFNSSIKGSRSHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P15260		aa.15-246 of premature protein	9	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8535161	High-yield expression, refolding, and purification of penicillin-binding protein 2a from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain 27R.	The mecA-27R gene, which encodes PBP2a from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain 27R, was modified to remove the putative N-terminal membrane-spanning region, cloned into the T7 RNA polymerase expression vector pET11d, and used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). The majority of PBP2a was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies, which were extracted, denatured, and refolded. The protein was then purified by anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. A 6-liter culture of induced E. coli provided 37 mg of purified PBP2a which was greater than 99d0c850ure. Binding affinities for [3H]benzylpenicillin, imipenem, and L-695,256 (a beta-lactam with high affinity for PBP2a) were shown to be comparable to PBP2a found in membrane preparations of S. aureus strain 27R. A direct binding assay, using 14C-labeled L-695,256 was developed and used to show stoichiometric binding to the refolded, soluble PBP2a. In addition, electrospray mass spectrometry showed that 1000f the refolded PBP2a was covalently bound to the beta-lactam in a stoichiometric fashion. Finally, two mutations of the putative active-site serine showed the predicted loss of covalent binding of the beta-lactam to the PBP2a, demonstrating the high specificity of the soluble binding assay.	1995 Oct	Frank L J,Wisniewski D,Hammond G G,Hermes J,Marcy A,Cameron P M	Protein expression and purification. 6(5) 671-8	Penicillin-Binding Protein 2a	YASKDKEINNTIDAIEDKNFKQVYKDSSYISKSDNGEVEMTERPIKIYNSLGVKDINIQDRKIKKVSKNKKRVDAQYKIKTNYGNIDRNVQFNFVKEDGMWKLDWDHSVIIPGMQKDQSIHIENLKSERGKILDRNNVELANTGTAYEIGIVPKNVSKKDYKAIAKELSISEDYIKQQMDQNWVQDDTFVPLKTVKKMDEYLSDFAKKFHLTTNETESRNYPLGKATSHLLGYVGPINSEELKQKEYKGYKDDAVIGKKGLEKLYDKKLQHEDGYRVTIVDDNSNTIAHTLIEKKKKDGKDIQLTIDAKVQKSIYNNMKNDYGSGTAIHPQTGELLALVSTPSYDVYPFMYGMSNEEYNKLTEDKKEPLLNKFQITTSPGSTQKILTAMIGLNNKTLDDKTSYKIDGKGWQKDKSWGGYNVTRYEVVNGNIDLKQAIESSDNIFFARVALELGSKKFEKGMKKLGVGEDIPSDYPFYNAQISNKNLDNEILLADSGYGQGEILINPVQILSIYSALENNGNINAPHLLKDTKNKVWKKNIISKENINLLTDGMQQVVNKTHKEDIYRSYANLIGKSGTAELKMKQGETGRQIGWFISYDKDNPNMMMAINVKDVQDKGMASYNAKISGKVYDELYENGNKKYDIDE	NB: potential active site mutants S403C or S403A also expressed and purified.

11237688	Cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of rat MMP-12.	Macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12) is implicated in the pathology of many diseases such as emphysema, aortic lesions and cancer. Recently, MMP-12 was cloned and purified from mouse and human macrophages. We report here the expression of the full-length and catalytic domain of rat MMP-12 in Escherichia coli and characterization of the purified enzyme. Inclusion bodies of expressed rat MMP-12 catalytic domain were denatured and refolded using a new method, and then affinity purified to near homogeneity with zinc-chelating Sepharose. The purified rat MMP-12 catalytic domain was highly active in digesting substrates, having a K(m) of 12 microM and optimal pH of 7.5--8.5. During investigation of natural substrate specificity, we found that rat MMP-12 catalytic domain was able to completely degrade collagen-V, partially degrade collagen-I, but it was unable to digest collagen-IV. The enzyme could also degrade osteonectin, vitronectin, and fibronectin, but not laminin and albumin. The catalytic properties and natural substrate specificity of rat MMP-12 catalytic domain differed from those of human MMP-12 catalytic domain.	2001 Mar	Fu J Y,Lyga A,Shi H,Blue M L,Dixon B,Chen D	Protein expression and purification. 21(2) 268-74	Macrophage Metalloelastase (MMP-12)	MKFLLVLVLLVSLQVSACGAAPMNESEFAEWYLSRFFDYQGDRIPMTKTKTNRNLLEEKLQEMQQFFGLEVTGQLDTSTLKIMHTSRCGVPDVQHLRAVPQRSRWMKRYLTYRIYNYTPDMKRADVDYIFQKAFQVWSDVTPLRFRKIHKGEADITILFAFGDHGDFYDFDGKGGTLAHAFYPGPGIQGDAHFDEAETWTKSFQGTNLFLVAVHELGHSLGLRHSNNPKSIMYPTYRYLHPNTFRLSADDIHSIQSLYGAPVKNPSLTNPGSPPSTVCHQSLSFDAVTTVGDKIFFFKDWFFWWRLPGSPATNITSISSMWPTIPSGIQAAYEIGGRNQLFLFKDEKYWLINNLVPEPHYPRSIHSLGFPASVKKIDAAVFDPLRQKVYFFVDKQYWRYDVRQELMDAAYPKLISTHFPGIRPKIDAVLYFKRHYYIFQGAYQLEYDPLLDRVTKTLSSTSWFGC	In this study, 2 different contructs of MMP-12 expressed and refolded - full intact protein and catalytic domainCatalytic domain:LRAVP 100QRSRWMKRYL TYRIYNYTPD MKRADVDYIF QKAFQVWSDV TPLRFRKIHK 150GEADITILFA FGDHGDFYDF DGKGGTLAHA FYPGPGIQGD AHFDEAETWT 200KSFQGTNLFL VAVHELGHSL GLRHSNNPKS IMYPTYRYLH PNTFRLSADD 250IHSIQSLYGA PVKNPSLTNP GSPPSTVNumber of amino acids: 182Molecular weight: 20785Theoretical pI: 9.05	Q63341			7.5	4	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12538476	Cell culture in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and the association with molecular markers.	PURPOSE:We reported previously that the patients in whom cancer cells could be cultured as continuous cell lines had a poor prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients. In this study, to evaluate additional evidence of prognostic significance and the genetic background of cell culture, we analyzed 203 ESCC patients.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:Culture samples were obtained from resected 203 primary ESCC (from 1986 to 1998; R0 resection). The expression of six molecular markers was evaluated retrospectively in resected primary esophageal tumors by immunohistochemical analysis, and the capability of establishing cell lines was compared.RESULTS:Thirty-five cell lines (17.2%) were established from 203 ESCC patients: group 1 (n = 35), from whom cancer cells could be cultured as continuous cell lines, and group 2 (n = 168), from whom cell lines could not be established. The cumulative survival rate of patients in group 1 was significantly lower than that of those in group 2 (P = 0.0006). Cox&#39;s proportional hazard model revealed that cell culture capability was an independent prognostic factor (risk ratio, 1.98; P = 0.007). Univariate logistic regression analysis revealed that cell culture capability had associations with the following molecular biological factors: cyclin D1, p53, murine double minute 2, p27, and fragile histidine triad gene (P &lt; 0.05). However, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that p53 protein accumulation and MDM2 protein expression predict establishment of cell line in ESCC (odds ratio, 7.72 and 8.62, respectively).CONCLUSIONS:Cell culture capability is a significant prognostic factor in ESCC. p53 and MDM2 may have a crucial role in the establishment of ESCC cell lines.	2003 Jan	Shimada Yutaka,Maeda Masato,Watanabe Go,Yamasaki Seiji,Komoto Izumi,Kaganoi Junichi,Kan Takatsugu,Hashimoto Yosuke,Imoto Issei,Inazawa Johji,Imamura Masayuki	Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. 9(1) 243-9	Daunorubicin resistance protein	MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEGRHMQQQAIQIIGARENNLKGISVEVPKHKVTVFTGVSGSGKSSLVFDTIAAESQRQLNETFTAFVRNRLPKYGQPDVDDIANLSAAVIIDQKRIGGNARSTVGTITDIYALLRLLYSRVGKPWIGYSNAFSFNDPSGMCPDCEGLGHRVQVDLDKLLDRSKSLNEGAIRHPAFNVGGWFWKLYANSGLFDNDKKLRDYTESEWQAFLYGAQGSIALEWQGGKVNSKYEGLMDKFNRLYLRKEPDEMSAKNRVALQQVVTRGPCDTCKGQRLSQRALGCRINGRNIAELASLEIADLMEAVKKVDTSSVSTLTASLIERLQHLIELGLGYLSLNRETSTLSGGESQRIKMVRHLNSSLVDMVYIFDEPTIGLHPSDVQRLSRLLMELAEKGNTVLVVEHDRDIIEVAEHVIDIGPGAGRHGGEIVYQGDVRGLTEADTPTGRFLRRIIPIKERFRGPRGHLEVTGARIHNLKDISVRIPLGVLTAVTGPAGSGKSTLIHDVLLRQHPSAVVIDQSAVTTNRRSNPATYTGIMDEIRRLFARENQVSPSLFSFNSEGACPTCQGHGIIYTDLAFMDPMITTCEVCAGMRFTDDVLRLTLRGQNIHDVLSMSAAEAAEFFTEPKVAKTLRSINQVGLGYLQLGQPLNTLSGGECQRIKLATELGKKGSVYVMDEPTTGLHMSDVDSLVHLVDGLVEKGDSVIVIEHNLDVVKHADWVVDLGPGGGSEGGRVIFEGTPADLAEAEHSVTGRFLAASLAGAGSEADHRARR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q54827			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8892835	The DnrN protein of Streptomyces peucetius, a pseudo-response regulator, is a DNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of daunorubicin biosynthesis.	DnrN, a protein essential for the transcription of the dnrI gene, which in turn activates transcription of the daunorubicin biosynthesis genes in Streptomyces peucetius, was overproduced in Escherichia coli and S. peucetius. The cell-free extract from E. coli was used to conduct DNA-binding assays. The results of gel mobility shift analysis showed that DnrN binds specifically to the dnrI promoter region with a high affinity (Kd = 50 nM). Neither acetyl phosphate nor ATP affected the binding ability, and there was no difference in binding between wild-type DnrN and a mutant form (D-55--&gt;N) lacking the putative phosphorylation site (aspartate 55) of a response regulator protein. Therefore, phosphorylation of DnrN apparently is not necessary for DNA binding. DNase I footprinting analysis indicated binding regions at 37 to 55 bp and 62 to 100 bp upstream of the transcriptional start point of dnrI. Interestingly, the sequence of these regions includes consecutive overlapping triplets [5&#39;-(A/T)GC, 5&#39;-(A/T)CG, 5&#39;-(A/T)C(A/T)] that have been shown to be the preferential binding site of daunorubicin (J. B. Chaires and J. E. Herrera, Biochemistry 29:6145-6153, 1990). This may explain why daunorubicin appeared to inhibit the binding of DnrN to the dnrI promoter, which could result in feedback repression of daunorubicin production. The results of Western blotting (immunoblotting) analysis with His-tagged DnrN antiserum showed that dnrN expression is coincident with daunorubicin production and that the maximum level of DnrN is 0.010f total protein in the wild-type S. peucetius strain. Since the level of DnrN was lowered in mutant strains that do not produce daunorubicin, we speculate that dnrN and dnrI expression are regulated by daunorubicin.	1996 Nov	Furuya K,Hutchinson C R	Journal of bacteriology. 178(21) 6310-8	Regulatory protein	MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIEGRHMTIRVVIAEELEMVRAALVLLVERESDIKVVASTGVGSELIRTVLEYSPDVTVIDVDMHEREGLLSAMAIQEHLPDCRTLLTARFARLATVRQSLASGLGGLVLKSSPPAHLSDAIRSVHEGRRVFDTELTLAAWGNTGCPLTEREMEILQLAAAGDDINEIAVKLSLSPGTVRNYLATTVRKMDARNRLDAVRIASMSGWI	DnrN variants D55N and D55E also expressed and refolded,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q54821			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1565634	HLA-A2-peptide complexes: refolding and crystallization of molecules expressed in Escherichia coli and complexed with single antigenic peptides.	The two subunits of the human class I histocompatibility antigen (HLA)-A2 have been expressed at high levels (20-30 mg/liter) as insoluble aggregates in bacterial cells. The aggregates were dissolved in 8 M urea and then refolded to form an HLA-A2-peptide complex by removal of urea in the presence of an antigenic peptide. Two peptides from the matrix protein and nucleoprotein of influenza virus are known to bind to HLA-A2, and both support the refolding of the recombinant HLA-A2 molecule. An additional peptide, a nonamer from the gp120 envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, also supported refolding. Yields of purified recombinant HLA-A2 are 10-15%. In the absence of an HLA-A2-restricted peptide, a stable HLA-A2 complex was not formed. Monoclonal antibodies known to bind to native HLA-A2 also bound to the recombinant HLA-A2-peptide complex. Three purified HLA-A2-peptide complexes refolded from bacterially produced protein aggregates crystallize under the identical conditions as HLA-A2 purified from human lymphoblastoid cells. Crystals of the recombinant HLA-A2 molecule in complex with the influenza matrix nonamer peptide, Mp(58-66), diffract to greater than 1.5-A resolution.	1992 Apr	Garboczi D N,Hung D T,Wiley D C	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 89(8) 3429-33	Class I histocompatibility antigen HLA-A	GSHSMRYFFTSVSRPGRGEPRFIAVGYVDDTQFVRFDSDAASQRMEPRAPWIEQEGPEYWDGETRKVKAHSQTHRVDLGTLRGYYNQSEAGSHTVQRMYGCDVGSDWRFLRGYHQYAYDGKDYIALKEDLRSWTAADMAAQTTKHKWEAAHVAEQLRAYLEGTCVEWLRRYLENGKETLQRTDAPKTHMTHHAVSDHEATLRCWALSFYPAEITLTWQRDGEDQTQDTELVETRPAGDGTFQKWAAVVVPSGQEQRYTCHVQHEGLPKPLTLRWE	Heavy chain enconding 1-275 of HLA-A2 expressed and refolded.

The aggregates were dissolved in 8 M urea and then refolded to form an HLA-A2-peptide complex by removal of urea in the presence of an antigenic peptide. Two peptides from the matrix protein and nucleoprotein of influenza virus are known to bind to HLA-A2, and both support the refolding of the recombinant HLA-A2 molecule. An additional peptide, a nonamer from the gp120 envelope protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1, also supported refolding. Yields of purified recombinant HLA-A2 are 10-15%. In the absence of an HLA-A2-restricted peptide, a stable HLA-A2 complex was not formed. Monoclonal antibodies known to bind to native HLA-A2 also bound to the recombinant HLA-A2-peptide complex. Three purified HLA-A2-peptide complexes refolded from bacterially produced protein aggregates crystallize under the identical conditions as HLA-A2 purified from human lymphoblastoid cells.

9489992	Large-scale preparation of biologically active recombinant ovine obese protein (leptin).	Prokaryotic expression vector pMON3401 encoding full size A(-1) ovine leptin was prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of previously described cDNA. E. coli cells transformed with this vector overexpressed large amounts of ovine leptin upon induction with nalidixic acid. The expressed protein found in the inclusion bodies was refolded and purified to homogeneity on Q-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose columns, yielding two electrophoretically pure fractions (leptin-Q and leptin-SP), composed respectively of 90 and 950f monomeric protein of the expected molecular mass of 16 kDa. The purified protein was capable of interacting with antibodies raised against (GST-ovine leptin and to bind specifically to ventromedial hypothalamus of ewes. The biological activity of both fractions resulting from proper renaturation was further evidenced by their ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in leptin-sensitive BAF/3 cells transfected with a long form of human leptin receptor construct.	1998 Jan	Gertler A,Simmons J,Keisler D H	FEBS letters. 422(2) 137-40	Leptin	MAVPIRKVQDDTKTLIKTIVTRINDISHTQSVSSKQRVTGLDFIPGLHPLLSLSKMDQTLAIYQQILASLPSRNVIQISNDLENLRDLLHLLAASKSCPLPQVRALESLESLGVVLEASLYSTEVVALSRLQGSLQDMLRQLDLSPGC		Q28603			11.3	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
9882621	Magnesium chelatase from Rhodobacter sphaeroides: initial characterization of the enzyme using purified subunits and evidence for a BchI-BchD complex.	The enzyme magnesium-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (Mg chelatase) catalyses the insertion of Mg into protoporphyrin IX, the first committed step in (bacterio)chlorophyll biosynthesis. In the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, this reaction is catalysed by the products of the bchI, bchD and bchH genes. These genes have been expressed in Escherichia coli so that the BchI, BchD and BchH proteins are produced with N-terminal His6 affinity tags, which has led to the production of large amounts of highly purified, highly active Mg chelatase subunits from a single chromatography step. Furthermore, BchD has been purifed free of contamination with the chaperone GroEL, which had proven to be a problem in the past. BchD, present largely as an insoluble protein in E. coli, was purified in 6 M urea and refolded by addition of BchI, MgCl2 and ATP, yielding highly active protein. BchI/BchD mixtures prepared in this way were used in conjunction with BchH to determine the kinetic parameters of R. sphaeroides Mg chelatase for its natural substrates. We have been able to demonstrate for the first time that BchI and BchD form a complex, and that Mg2+ and ATP are required to establish and maintain this complex. Gel filtration data suggest that BchI and BchD form a complex of molecular mass 200 kDa in the presence of Mg2+ and ATP. Our data suggest that, in vivo, BchD is only folded correctly and maintained in its correct conformation in the presence of BchI, Mg2+ and ATP.	1999 Jan	Gibson L C,Jensen P E,Hunter C N	The Biochemical journal. 337 ( Pt 2) 243-51	Magnesium chelatase D subunit	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMMPLGPWERVEAALTLLAIDPAGLKGLWLRARASALRDRITGALGALPLPVRRIHPTIGDDALFGGLDLAATLSAGTPVVQKGILDEPAVLVLAMAERTLPGLAARLGTALDAPRHCLIALDEGAERDELLPLGLVDRLALFLDLDGLPWGETREIALDPERLAAARARLAAVATPPEAAATLARVAAQLGIASLRAPTLALAAARAQAAWEGHAAVTDEDIRRAADLVFAHRAMPASEEAPPEPEPEPPEDQPDDSPPPPEQQQGEEMFPEEMLVEAVRAALPADLLEQLAAGRAARMARGATGTGSAKAGNRRGRPLPSRMGRLGTGARIDLVGTLRAAAPWQPLRRRQQKTDAVLLVRPSDIRIKRFRETSDRVLIFAVDASGSSAMARLSEAKGAVELLLGQAYARRDHVSLLAFRGRDAELILPPTRSLVQTKRRLAGLPGGGGTPLAHGLRLALAVGLQARARGMTPTVALLTDGRGNIALDGSANRAQAEEDALKLAASLRGSGLPAVVIDTANRPQPSLAALARALDAPYIALPRADAHKLSNVLGAAMGDAPAANKARKEAELAAATAEQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O34845			7.9	34	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

T lymphocytes use TCR-alphabeta to bind and to recognize complexes of antigenic peptides bound to MHC proteins located at the surface of APCs. We have assembled and crystallized this intercellular complex of TCR/peptide/MHC from soluble human TCR-alphabeta and soluble peptide/HLA-A2 complexes. The soluble TCR-alphabeta binds specifically to its in vivo ligand, the complex of HLA-A2, and a peptide from the Tax protein of human T lymphotropic virus type 1. The soluble TCR also binds in vitro to an altered peptide ligand, which appears to be a partial agonist in T cell assays as determined by its ability to elicit different cytolytic and lymphokine secretion responses. Heterodimerization and the antigenic specificity of the TCR do not require its interchain disulfide bond, transmembrane segments, or glycosylations.

9843672	Crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the lumazine synthase from Brucella abortus.	Lumazine synthase from Brucella abortus was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified to apparent homogeneity. Crystals of lumazine synthase were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method using polyethylene glycol 8000 or ammonium sulfate as precipitants. They belong to the trigonal space group P321 with cell parameters a = b = 132.00A, c = 167.25 A. A complete diffraction data set to 3.7 A resolution has been collected using synchrotron radiation. Preliminary analysis of the quaternary structure of this protein by means of a self-rotation function calculated with the diffraction data clearly indicates 532 symmetry compatible with the presence of an icosahedral lumazine synthase particle.	1998 Oct	Goldbaum F A,Polikarpov I,Cauerhff A A,Velikovsky C A,Braden B C,Poljak R J	Journal of structural biology. 123(2) 175-8	Lumazine synthase 2	MNQSCPNKTSFKIAFIQARWHADIVDEARKSFVAELAAKTGGSVEVEIFDVPGAYEIPLHAKTLARTGRYAAIVGAAFVIDGGIYRHDFVATAVINGMMQVQLETEVPVLSVVLTPHHFHESKEHHDFFHAHFKVKGVEAAHAAL		P61711		aa.1-145	7.4	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
11676602	An enhanced and scalable process for the purification of SIV Gag-specific MHC tetramer.	A recently developed method for the identification and quantitation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes involves the use of complexes of biotinylated major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and avidin conjugated to a fluorescent reporter group. This complex, dubbed the &quot;tetramer,&quot; binds to antigen-specific T lymphocytes in vitro, which can then be sorted and counted by fluorescence-activated flow cytometry to measure immune response. Our research has focused on developing the purification process for preparing tetramer reagent. Our goal was to reengineer a published lab-scale purification process to reduce the number of processing steps and to make the process scalable. In our reengineered process, recombinant MHC alpha chain is isolated from Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies by tangential flow filtration. The purified MHC alpha chain is refolded with beta-2-microglobulin and the target peptide antigen to form the class I MHC. The resulting MHC is purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and biotinylated enzymatically, and the biotinylated MHC is purified by a second HIC step. The tetramer is prepared by mixing biotinylated MHC with an avidin-fluorophore conjugate. The tetramer is further purified to remove any excess MHC or avidin components. Analysis by flow cytometry confirmed that the tetramers generated by this new process gave bright staining and specific binding to CD3+/CD8+ cells of vaccinated monkeys and led to results that were equivalent to those generated with tetramer produced by the original process.	2001 Nov	Grimm K M,Trigona W L,Heidecker G J,Joyce J G,Fu T M,Shiver J W,Keller P M,Cook J C	Protein expression and purification. 23(2) 270-81	MHC class I Mamu-A 01	APRTLLLVLSGALVLTQTRAGSHSMKYFYTSMSRPGRGQPRFIAVGYVDDTQFVRFDSDAASQRMEPRAPWVEQEGPEYWDRETRNMKTETQNAPVNLRTLLRYYNQSEAGSHTLQRMVGCDLGPDGRLLRGYEQYAYDGKDYIALNEDLRSWTAADVAAQNTQRKWEAADVAESMRAYLEGQCVEWLPRYLEKGKETLQRTDPPKTHVTHHPVSDHEATLRCWALGFYPAEITLTWQRDGEDQTQDTELVETRPAGDGTFQKWAAVVVPSGEEQRYTCHVQHEGLPKPHTLKWEPFSQSTIPMVGIIAGLVLLGAVVTGAVVAAVMWRRKSSDRKGGSYSQAASSDSAQGSDVSLTACKV		Q30596			8.3	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8745410	Reconstitution of active octameric mitochondrial creatine kinase from two genetically engineered fragments.	Creatine kinase (CK) has been postulated to consist of two flexibly hinged domains. A previously demonstrated protease-sensitive site in M-CK (Morris &amp; Jackson, 1991) has directed our attempts to dissect mitochondrial CK (Mi-CK) into two protein fragments encompassing amino acids [1-167] and [168-380]. When expressed separately in Escherichia coli, the two fragments yielded large amounts of insoluble inclusion bodies, from which the respective polypeptides could be purified by a simple two-step procedure. In contrast, co-expression of the two fragments yielded a soluble, active, and correctly oligomerizing enzyme. This discontinuous CK showed nearly full specific activity and was virtually indistinguishable from native Mi-CK by far- and near-UV CD. However, the positive cooperativity of substrate binding was abolished, suggesting a role of the covalent domain linkage in the crosstalk between the substrate binding sites for ATP and creatine. The isolated C-terminal fragment refolded into a native-like conformation in vitro, whereas the N-terminal fragment was largely unfolded. Prefolded [168-380] interacted in vitro with [1-167] to form an active enzyme. Kinetic analysis indicated that the fragments associate rapidly and with high affinity (1/K1 = 17 microM) and then isomerize slowly to an active enzyme (k2 = 0.12 min-1; k-2 = 0.03 min-1). Our data suggest that the C-terminal fragment of Mi-CK represents an autonomous folding unit, and that the folding of the C-terminal part might precede the conformational stabilization of the N-terminal moiety in vivo.	1996 Feb	Gross M,Wyss M,Furter-Graves E M,Wallimann T,Furter R	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 5(2) 320-30	Creatine kinase	MPFSSTHNKHKLKFSAEEEFPDLSKHNNHMAKVLTPELYKRLRDKETPSGFTLDDVIQTGVDNPGHPFIMTVGCVAGDEESYEVFKDLFDPVIQDRHGGYKPTDKHRTDLNHENLKGGDDLDPKYVLSSRVRTGRSIKGYSLPPHCSRGERRAVEKLSVEALNSLEG	Mitochondrial creatine kinase	P00565		Fragment aa.1-167	7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
10081758	Expression of bovine cytokines in Escherichia coli.	Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of bovine interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were expressed in Escherichia coli. Complementary DNA (cDNA) for open reading frame of each cytokine without signal peptide encoding region was amplified by reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction method and was subcloned into pGEX-5X-1. In result, IL-6 and IFN-gamma fusion proteins in bacteria were soluble, but IL-2 and IL-4 fusion proteins were insoluble. The insoluble IL-2 fusion protein successfully refolded by urea became soluble. The recombinant IL-2, IL-6 and IFN-gamma could be obtained by the batch method using Glutathione Sepharose 4B and Factor Xa digestion, which may be useful for preparation of antisera as antigens and functional studies.	1999 Feb	Kashima T,Morishita A,Iwata H,Maeda K,Inoue T	The Journal of veterinary medical science / the Japanese Society of Veterinary Science. 61(2) 171-3	Interleukin-2	APTSSSTGNTMKEVKSLLLDLQLLLEKVKNPENLKLSRMHTFDFYVPKVNATELKHLKCLLEELKLLEEVLNLAPSKNLNPREIKDSMDNIKRIVLELQGSETRFTCEYDDATVNAVEFLNKWITFCQSIYSTMT	N-terminal GST	P05016			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
1544433	Construction and characterization of a fusion protein with epidermal growth factor and the cell-binding domain of fibronectin.	An efficient expression system was constructed for C-EGF, a fusion protein made of a fragment of the cell-binding domain of human fibronectin (FN) bound with epidermal growth factor (EGF). C-EGF was produced in Escherichia coli HB101 cells carrying the recombinant plasmid pCE102 as inclusion bodies, which were solubilized and refolded after purification. C-EGF had both cell-adhesive and EGF activities, so it might be more effective than EGF in therapeutic applications. This fusion system would be useful for the construction of a recombinant drug delivery system for cells that have fibronectin receptors (integrins).	1992 Feb	Kawase Y,Ohdate Y,Shimojo T,Taguchi Y,Kimizuka F,Kato I	FEBS letters. 298(2-3) 126-8	Epidermal Growth Factor	PTDLRFTNIGPDTMRVTWAPPPSIDLTNFLVRYSPVKNEEDVAELSISPSDNAVVLTNLLPGTEYVVSVSSVYEQHESTPLRGRQKTGLDSPTGIDFSDITANSFTVHWIAPRATITGYRIRHHPEHFSGRPREDRVPHSRNSITLTNLTPGTEYVVSIVALNGREESPLLIGQQSTVSDVPRDLEVVAATPTSLLISWDAPAVTVRYYRITYGETGGNSPVQEFTVPGSKSTATISGLKPGVDYTITVYAVTGRGDSPASSKPISINYRTEIDKPSMANSDSECPLSHDGYCLHDGVCMYIEALDKYACNCVVGYIGERCQYRDLKWWELR	N-terminal fibronectin cell-binding domain	P01133			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9405420	Conformational integrity and ligand binding properties of a single chain T-cell receptor expressed in Escherichia coli.	We recently showed that a soluble, heterodimeric murine D10 T-cell receptor (TCR) (Valpha2Calpha, Vbeta8.2Cbeta) expressed in insect cells binds both Vbeta8.2-specific bacterial superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin C2 (SEC2) and a soluble, heterodimeric major histocompatibility complex class II I-Ak.conalbumin peptide complex with a low micromolar affinity. To define further the structural requirements for the TCR/ligand interactions, we have produced in Escherichia coli a soluble, functional D10 single chain (sc) TCR molecule in which the Valpha and Vbeta domains are connected by a flexible peptide linker. Purified and refolded D10 scTCR bound to SEC2 and murine major histocompatibility complex class II I-Ak.conalbumin peptide complex with thermodynamic and kinetic binding constants similar to those measured for the baculovirus-derived heterodimeric D10 TCR suggesting that neither the TCR constant domains nor potential N- or O-linked carbohydrate moieties are necessary for ligand recognition and for expression and proper folding of the D10 scTCR. Purified D10 scTCR remained soluble at concentrations up to 1 mM. Circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy indicated that D10 scTCR is stabilized predominantly by beta-sheet secondary structure, consistent with its native-like conformation. Because of its limited size, high solubility, and structural integrity, purified D10 scTCR appears to be suitable for structural studies by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy.	1997 Dec	Khandekar S S,Bettencourt B M,Wyss D F,Naylor J W,Brauer P P,Huestis K,Dwyer D S,Profy A T,Osburne M S,Banerji J,Jones B	The Journal of biological chemistry. 272(51) 32190-7	T-Cell receptor D10 single chain	SSLVPRGSAVSQSPRNKVAVTGGKVTLSCNQTNNHNNMYWYRQDTGHGLRLIHYSYGAGSTEKGDIPDGYKASRPSQENFSLILELATPSQTSVYFCASGGQGRAEQFFGPGTRLTVLGSDYKDDDDKRSGGGGSGGGGSGGSGAQQQVRQSPQSLTVWEGETTILNCSYEDSTFDYFPWYRQFPGKSPALLIAISLVSNKKEDGRFTIFFNKREKKLSLHITDSQPGDSATYFCAATGSFNKLTFGAGTRLAVSPYHHHHHH	UniProt is 980mologous to V-alpha portion of constructMBP tag cleaved prior to unfolding and refoldingAlso see SCOP ref.48936,N-terminal maltose-binding protein tag/C-terminal His tag	Q5R1G1			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
2271546	Role of the zinc(II) ions in the structure of the three-finger DNA binding domain of the Sp1 transcription factor.	The transcription factor Sp1 from Hela cells contains near the C-terminus of this protein of 778 amino acids three contiguous repeats of an amino acid sequence, -Cys-X4-Cys-X12-His-X3-His-, typical of the Cys2His2-type zinc-finger DNA binding domain first found in transcription factor TFIIIA. A DNA sequence corresponding to the condons from residue 614 to residue 778 of Spl (encompassing the three zinc-finger motifs) has been cloned and overproduced in Escherichia coli. The fragment of Sp1 containing the C-terminal 165 residues plus 2 from the cloning vector, designated Sp1(167*), can be extracted with 5 M urea and then refolded in the presence of Zn(II) to a protein of specific conformation containing 3.0 +/- 0.2 mol of tightly bound Zn(II)/mol of protein. Gel retardation assays using a labeled 14-bp DNA sequence containing a consensus Sp1 binding site show that the refolded Zn(II) protein specifically recognizes the &quot;GC box&quot; sequence in the presence of a large excess of calf thymus DNA. Treatment of Zn(II)Sp1(167*) with 10 mM EDTA results in removal of Zn(II) and the formation of an apoprotein which does not specifically recognize DNA. Cd(II) can be exchanged for Zn(II) in the refolded protein with full retention of specific DNA recognition. This is the first Cys2His2-type &quot;finger&quot; protein where this substitution has been accomplished. Titration of the Zn(II) protein with 6 mol of p-mercuribenzenesulfonate/mol of protein results in the complete release of the three Zn(II) ions. Release of Zn(II) is highly cooperative.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1990 Sep	Kuwahara J,Coleman J E	Biochemistry. 29(37) 8627-31	Transcription factor Sp1	SEGRGSGDPGKKKQHICHIQGCGKVYGKTSHLRAHLRWHTGERPFMCTWSYCGKRFTRSDELQRHKRTHTGEKKFACPECPKRFMRSDHLSKHIKTHQNKKGGPGVALSVGTLPLDSGAGSEGSGTATPSALITTNMVAMEAICPEGIARLANSGINVMQVADLQSI	DNA binding domain comprises 3 zinc fingers	P08047		DNA binding domain aa.612-778	7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

A fusion protein, Sta-CBDCex, which comprises streptavidin with a cellulose-binding domain (CBDCex) fused to its C terminus, was produced in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, where it formed inclusion bodies. Renatured Sta-CBDCex, recovered from the inclusion bodies, adsorbed to Avicel, a microcrystalline cellulose. The cellulose-bound Sta-CBDCex in turn bound biotinylated alkaline phosphatase or biotinylated beta-glucosidase. The immobilized beta-glucosidase remained fully active during 2 weeks of continuous column operation at 50 degrees C.	1994 Jun	Le K D,Gilkes N R,Kilburn D G,Miller R C,Saddler J N,Warren R A	Enzyme and microbial technology. 16(6) 496-500	Exo-beta-1,4-glucanase	CQVLWGVNQWNTGFTANVTVKNTSSAPVDGWTLTFSFPSGQQVTQAWSSTVTQSGSAVTVRNAPWNGSIPAGGTAQFGFNGSHTGTNAAPTAFSLNGTPC	Sequence does not include steptavidin tag,N-terminal streptavidin	Q59277		Cellulose binding domain	7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8325379	Cloning, expression and purification of a recombinant poly-histidine-linked HIV-1 protease.	The gene coding for the HIV-1 protease was cloned in an Escherichia coli expression vector adding three-histidine codons to the amino and carboxy terminus of the protease sequence. Expression of the protease from this construct led to the accumulation of high amounts of insoluble histidine-linked protease entrapped in inclusion bodies. The histidine-linked protease could be efficiently released from purified inclusion bodies with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and further purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography. The refolded protease cleaved synthetic peptide substrates and the viral polyprotein p55 with the same specificity as the wild type protease. It displays a specific activity of 4.4 mumol/min/mg.	1993 Jul	Leuthardt A,Roesel J L	FEBS letters. 326(1-3) 275-80	HIV protease	MRGSHHHGSPQITLWQRPLVTIKIGGQLKEALLDTGADDTVLEEMNLPGRWKPKMIGGIGGFIKVRQYDQILIEICGHKAIGTVLVGPTPVNIIGRNLLTQAGCTLNFRSHHH	N-terminal and C-terminal poly-histidine tags	P03366			6	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9602090	Functional implications of the 21-24 loop in recombinant prochymosin.	To investigate the role of the 21-24 (pepsin numbering) loop in prochymosin, the amino acid residues GTPP at positions 21 through 24 were replaced with GG, the equivalent loop residues from its homologous protein, penicillopepsin, or SG, GS by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutants except GTPP(21-24)GS could be expressed in Escherichia coli. Activation studies indicated that the refolded prochymosin mutants were capable of undergoing autocatalytic activation to produce pseudochymosin by cleaving its N-terminal 27 amino acid residues at pH 2. The resulting pseudochymosin mutants were able to convert into chymosin at pH 5.5 by further autocatalytic cleavage to remove additional 15 amino acid residues. These results demonstrate that the prochymosin analogs can fold into an active state from an unfolded state and that the pseudochymosin analogs can proceed in the transformation from one active form into another active form. Spectroscopic analyses revealed that after mutation the far UV CD spectrum of prochymosin was considerably modified, showing less negative ellipticity values, and the fluorescence emission intensities of prochymosin and pseudochymosin were remarkably reduced. The stabilities of prochymosin and pseudochymosin, especially, were dramatically decreased. The stabilization energy of prochymosin was reduced by 7-8 kJ/mol. The inactivation temperature of pseudochymosin was decreased by 15-20 degrees C. The wild-type pseudochymosin was stable at pH 1.5 and 6.5, whereas the mutants were completely inactivated at the same pH values. Taken together, it is reasonable to conclude that the 21-24 loop (GTPP) plays an important role in determining the stability of prochymosin and pseudochymosin, although the mutants with mutated loop (GG or SG) still can refold into an active conformation.	1998 Apr	Li H,Zhang Y,Dong Y,Yang K	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1384(1) 121-9	Prochymosin	EVASVPLTNYLDSQYFGKIYLgtppQEFTVLFDTGSSDFWVPSIYCKSNACKNHQRFDPRKSSTFQNLGKPLSIHYGTGSMQGILGYDTVTVSNIVDIQQTVGLSTQEPGDVFTYAEFDGILGMAYPSLASEYSIPVFDNMMNRHLVAQDLFSVYMDRNGQESMLTLGAIDPSYYTGSLHWVPVTVQQYWQFTVDSVTISGVVVACEGGCQAILDTGTSKLVGPSSDILNIQQAIGATQNQYGEFDIDCDNLSYMPTVVFEINGKMYPLTPSAYTSQDQGFCTSGFQSENHSQKWILGDVFIREYYSVFDRANNLVGLAKAI	3 mutants created - substituting in for GTPP (aa.22-25)GG/GS/SGFor all three mutants:Number of amino acids: 320Molecular weight: 35357Theoretical pI: 4.42,pro sequence	P00794			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8376373	Recombinant canditropsin, an extracellular aspartic protease from yeast Candida tropicalis. Escherichia coli expression, purification, zymogen activation, and enzymic properties.	A cDNA fragment which encodes the zymogen of canditropsin, the extracellular aspartic protease from the yeast Candida tropicalis (Togni,G., Sanglard, D., Falchetto, R., and Monod, M. (1991) FEBS Lett. 286, 181-185) was cloned into a T7 expression vector for the synthesis of the recombinant zymogen in Escherichia coli. Recombinant canditropsinogen (Ctg), which was expressed as inclusion bodies in the cytosol of E. coli, was refolded by dialysis from an 8 M urea solution and purified to homogeneity using chromatographies on Sephacryl S-300 and on MonoQ columns. The purified Ctg was converted into canditropsin by either acid activation or trypsin conversion. The specificity of the resulting recombinant canditropsin toward polypeptide substrates is significantly different from other aspartic proteases. Canditropsin hydrolyzes oxidized insulin B chain between Ala-Leu and many other minor cleavage sites. Canditropsin also hydrolyzes keratin and collagen, which are components of connective tissues known to be hydrolyzed by canditropsin during Candida infections. Canditropsin was strongly inhibited by the universal aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin (Ki = 1.75 x 10(-8) M) and inactivated by two aspartic protease inactivators, DAN and EPNP. Canditropsin is weakly inhibited by leupeptin and antipain, with an apparent Ki of 1.74 x 10(-4)M and 1.5 x 10(-5) M, respectively.	1993 Sep	Lin X,Tang J,Koelsch G,Monod M,Foundling S	The Journal of biological chemistry. 268(27) 20143-7	Candidapepsin	LFAQGLTIPDGIEKRTDKVVSLDFTVIRKPFNATAHRLIQKRSDVPTTLINEGPSYAADIVVGSNQQKQTVVIDTGSSDLWVVDTDAECQVTYSGQTNNFCKQEGTFDPSSSSSAQNLNQDFSIEYGDLTSSQGSFYKDTVGFGGISIKNQQFADVTTTSVDQGIMGIGFTAVEAGYNLYSNVPVTLKKQGIINKNAYSCDLNSEDASTGKIIFGGVDNAKYTGTLTALPVTSSVELRVHLGSINFDGTSVSTNADVVLDSGTTITYFSQSTADKFARIVGATWDSRNEIYRLPSCDLSGDAVVNFDQGVKITVPLSELILKDSDSSICYFGISRNDANILGDNFLRRAYIVYDLDDKTISLAQVKYTSSSDISAL	Full sequence expressed and refolded, including  prosequence and protein	Q00663			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2494172	Synthesis, purification, and active site mutagenesis of recombinant porcine pepsinogen.	In order to carry out studies on structure and function relationships of porcine pepsinogen using site-directed mutagenesis approaches, the cDNA of this zymogen was cloned, sequenced, expressed in Escherichia coli, and the protein refolded, and purified to homogeneity. Porcine pepsinogen cDNA, obtained from a lambda gt10 cDNA library of porcine stomach contains 1364 base pairs. It contains leader, pro, and pepsin regions of 14, 44, and 326 residues, respectively. In addition, it also contains 5&#39;- and 3&#39;-untranslated regions. Four differences are present between the sequence deduced from the cDNA and the pepsinogen sequence determined previously by protein chemistry methods. Residues P19 (in the pro region) and 263 are asparagines in the cDNA sequence instead of aspartic acids. Isoleucine 230 is not present in the cDNA sequence and residue 242 is a tyrosine in the cDNA instead of an aspartic acid. Porcine pepsinogen cDNA was placed under the control of a tac promoter in a plasmid and expressed in E. coli. The synthesis of pepsinogen was optimized to about 50 mg/liter of culture. The recombinant (r-) pepsinogen, which was insoluble, was recovered by centrifugation, washed, dissolved in 6 M urea in Tris-HCl, pH 8, and refolded by rapid dilution. r-pepsinogen was purified to homogeneity after chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 and fast protein liquid chromatography on a monoQ column. r-pepsinogen contains an additional methionine residue at the NH2 terminus as compared to native (n-) pepsinogen. However, r- and n-pepsinogens are indistinguishable in their intramolecular activation constants. After activation, r- and n-pepsins have the same NH2-terminal sequences as well as Km values. Based on these data, r-pepsinogen was judged suitable for mutagenesis studies. A mutant pepsinogen (D32A) with the active site aspartic acid changed to an alanine was produced and purified. D32A-pepsinogen did not convert to pepsin in acid solution but it bound to pepstatin with an apparent KD of about 5 x 10(-10) M. D32A-pepsinogen possesses no detectable proteolytic activity. These results indicate that (i) intramolecular pepsinogen activation is accomplished by the pepsin active site, and (ii) unlike subtilisin (Carter, P., and Wells, J. A. (1988) Nature 332, 564-568), the active site mutant of pepsin is not enzymically active.	1989 Mar	Lin X L,Wong R N,Tang J	The Journal of biological chemistry. 264(8) 4482-9	Pepsin A	MKWLLLLSLVVLSECLVKVPLVRKKSLRQNLIKNGKLKDFLKTHKHNPASKYFPEAAALIGDEPLENYLDTEYFGTIGIGTPAQDFTVIFDTGSSNLWVPSVYCSSLACSDHNQFNPDDSSTFEATSQELSITYGTGSMTGILGYDTVQVGGISDTNQIFGLSETEPGSFLYYAPFDGILGLAYPSISASGATPVFDNLWDQGLVSQDLFSVYLSSNDDSGSVVLLGGIDSSYYTGSLNWVPVSVEGYWQITLDSITMDGETIACSGGCQAIVDTGTSLLTGPTSAIAINIQSDIGASENSDGEMVISCSSIDSLPDIVFTINGVQYPLSPSAYILQDDDSCTSGFEGMDVPTSSGELWILGDVFIRQYYTVFDRANNKVGLAPVA		P00791			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

The insoluble inclusion bodies of soluble leukemia inhibitory factor receptor fusion protein (gp 190 sol DAF) was solubilized in 8 M urea on the unfolding transitions, and several factors on the aggregate formation were indirectly analyzed for the refolding of gp 190 sol DAF. Results indicate that the refolding yield can be considerably increased at lowering concentration of the unfolding protein, a little soluble protein with the slow refolding appears in the process of the aggregate formation and the concentration of the denaturant must be down to a minimum level for its refolding.	1997 Apr	Liu H,Moreau J F,Gualde N,Fu J	Molecular and cellular biochemistry. 169(1-2) 43-50	Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor	HHHHHHMMDIYVCLKRPSWMVDNKRMRTASNFQWLLSTFILLYLMNQVNSQKKGAPHDLKCVTNNLQVWNCSWKAPSGTGRGTDYEVCIENRSRSCYQLEKTSIKIPALSHGDYEITINSLHDFGSSTSKFTLNEQNVSLIPDTPEILNLSADFSTSTLYLKWNDRGSVFPHRSNVIWEIKVLRKESMELVKLVTHNTTLNGKDTLHHWSWASDMPLECAIHFVEIRCYIDNLHFSGLEEWSDWSPVKNISWIPDSQTKVFPQDKVILVGSDITFCCVSQEKVLSALIGHTNCPLIHLDGENVAIKIRNISVSASSGTNVVFTTEDNIFGTVIFAGYPPDTPQQLNCETHDLKEIICSWNPGRVTALVGPRATSYTLVESFSGKYVRLKRAEAPTNESYQLLFQMLPNQEIYNFTLNAHNPLGRSQSTILVNITEKVYPHTPTSFKVKDINSTAVKLSWHLPGNFAKINFLCEIEIKKSNSVQEQRNVTIKGVENSSYLVALDKLNPYTLYTFRIRCSTETFWKWSKWSNKKQHLTTEASPSKGPDTWREWSSDGKNLIIYWKPLPINEANGKILSYNVSCSSDEETQSLSEIPDPQHKAEIRLDKNDYIISVVAKNSVGSSPPSKIASMEIPNDDLKIEQVVGMGKGILLTWHYDPNMTCDYVIKWCNSSRSEPCLMDWRKVPSNSTETVIESDEFRPGIRYNFFLYGCRNQGYQLLRSMIGYIEELAPIVAPNFTVEDTSADSILVKWEDIPVEELRGFLRGYLFYFGKGERDTSKMRVLESGRSDIKVKNITDISQKTLRIADLQGKTSYHLVLRAYTDGGVGPEKSMYVVTKENSPNKGSGTTSGTTRLLSGHTCFTLTGLLGTLVTMGLLT	GST fusion protein between hexaHis tag and protein, but not included in sequence,N-terminal hexahistidine and GST tag	P42702		Extracellular domain aa.1-833	9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
11036086	Crystal structure of the C-type lectin-like domain from the human hematopoietic cell receptor CD69.	CD69, one of the earliest specific antigens acquired during lymphoid activation, acts as a signal-transducing receptor involved in cellular activation events, including proliferation and induction of specific genes. CD69 belongs to a family of receptors that modulate the immune response and whose genes are clustered in the natural killer (NK) gene complex. The extracellular portion of these receptors represent a subfamily of C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs), which are divergent from true C-type lectins and are referred to as NK-cell domains (NKDs). We have determined the three-dimensional structure of human CD69 NKD in two different crystal forms. CD69 NKD adopts the canonical CTLD fold but lacks the features involved in Ca(2+) and carbohydrate binding by C-type lectins. CD69 NKD dimerizes noncovalently, both in solution and in crystalline state. The dimer interface consists of a hydrophobic, loosely packed core, surrounded by polar interactions, including an interdomain beta sheet. The intersubunit core shows certain structural plasticity that may facilitate conformational rearrangements for binding to ligands. The surface equivalent to the binding site of other members of the CTLD superfamily reveals a hydrophobic patch surrounded by conserved charged residues that probably constitutes the CD69 ligand-binding site.	2001 Mar	Llera A S,Viedma F,Sánchez-Madrid F,Tormo J	The Journal of biological chemistry. 276(10) 7312-9	CD69 Early activation antigen	VSSCSEDWVGYQRKCYFISTVKRSWTSAQNACSEHGATLAVIDSEKDMNFLKRYAGREEHWVGLKKEPGHPWKWSNGKEFNNWFNVTGSDKCVFLKNTEVSSMECEKNLYWICNKPYK		Q07108		Extracellular NK-cell domain, aa.82-199	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
9523712	Production and purification of active snowdrop lectin in Escherichia coli.	Recombinant snowdrop lectin was produced in Escherichia coli from a cDNA clone encoding mature Galanthus nivalis agglutinin. After induction with isopropylthio-beta-D-galactoside, inclusion bodies from E. coli were solubilised and the G. nivalis agglutinin purified by metal-affinity chromatography using a carboxy-terminal hexahistidine tag. The protein was refolded on the metal-affinity column prior to elution. After purification, the recombinant G. nivalis agglutinin agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes to a dilution similar to that determined for &#39;native&#39; lectin purified from snowdrop, and showed similar specific binding to mannose. The toxicity of the recombinant G. nivalis agglutinin towards rice brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) was shown to be similar to that of &#39;native&#39; G. nivalis agglutinin when incorporated into an artificial diet. The recombinant G. nivalis agglutinin is thus functionally similar to &#39;native&#39; snowdrop lectin.	1998 Feb	Longstaff M,Powell K S,Gatehouse J A,Raemaekers R,Newell C A,Hamilton W D	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 252(1) 59-65	Lectin	MAKASLLILAAIFLGVITPSCLSDNILYSGETLSTGEFLNYGSFVFIMQEDCNLVLYDVDKPIWATNTGGLSRSCFLSMQTDGNLVVYNPSNKPIWASNTGGQNGNYVCILQKDRNVVIYGTDRWATGTHTGLVGIPASPPSEKYPTAGKIKLVTAK		P30617			7.9	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

2160468	Complementation of two overlapping fragments of SecA, a protein translocation ATPase of Escherichia coli, allows ATP binding to its amino-terminal region.	SecA is a protein translocation ATPase. The secA gene was engineered so as to code for SecA fragments of different sizes, either from the amino terminus or the carboxyl terminus. These SecA fragments, most of which formed aggregates in the cytosol, were overproduced and then purified in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The fragments were renatured by means of dilution and dialysis, and then examined as to their ability to interact with ATP by means of photoaffinity cross-linking with [alpha-32P]ATP. Individual SecA fragments thus renatured were inactive as to ATP binding. However, when two fragments (amino- and carboxyl-terminal ones), which structurally complemented each other and which had an overlapping region, were mixed, cross-linking was observed at the amino-terminal segments. The cross-linking was appreciably enhanced when two such fragments were first mixed together in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and then renatured. It is concluded that SecA has an ATP-binding domain near its amino-terminal region and that the binding requires a carboxyl-terminal fragment that is large enough to cover the region deleted from the amino-terminal fragment. An amino-terminal fragment, which constituted about 920f the entire SecA molecule, was active in not only ATP binding but also protein translocation. Based on these findings, the structure-function relationship of SecA is discussed.	1990 May	Matsuyama S,Kimura E,Mizushima S	The Journal of biological chemistry. 265(15) 8760-5	Protein translocase SecA	MLIKLLTKVFGSRNDRTLRRMRKVVNIINAMEPEMEKLSDEELKGKTAEFRARLEKGEVLENLIPEAFAVVREASKRVFGMRHFDVQLLGGMVLNERCIAEMRTGEGKTLTATLPAYLNALTGKGVHVVTVNDYLAQRDAENNRPLFEFLGLTVGINLPGMPAPAKREAYAADITYGTNNEYGFDYLRDNMAFSPEERVQRKLHYALVDEVDSILIDEARTPLIISGPAEDSSEMYKRVNKIIPHLIRQEKEDSETFQGEGHFSVDEKSRQVNLTERGLVLIEELLVKEGIMDEGESLYSPANIMLMHHVTAALRAHALFTRDVDYIVKDGEVIIVDEHTGRTMQGRRWSDGLHQAVEAKEGVQIQNENQTLASITFQNYFRLYEKLAGMTGTADTEAFEFSSIYKLDTVVVPTNRPMIRKDLPDLVYMTEAEKIQAIIEDIKERTAKGQPVLVGTISIEKSELVSNELTKAGIKHNVLNAKFHANEAAIVAQAGYPAAVTIATNMAGRGTDIVLGGSWQAEVAALENPTAEQIEKIKADWQVRHDAVLEAGGLHIIGTERHESRRIDNQLRGRSGRQGDAGSSRFYLSMEDALMRIFASDRVSGMMRKLGMKPGEAIEHPWVTKAIANAQRKVESRNFDIRKQLLEYDDVANDQRRAIYSQRNELLDVSDVSETINSIREDVFKATIDAYIPPQSLEEMWDIPGLQERLKNDFDLDLPIAEWLDKEPELHEETLRERILAQSIEVYQRKEEVVGAEMMRHFEKGVMLQTLDSLWKEHLAAMDYLRQGIHLRGYAQKDPKQEYKRESFSMFAAMLESLKYEVISTLSKVQVRMPEEVEELEQQRRMEAERLAQMQQLSHQDDDSAAAAALAAQTGERKVGRNDPCPCGSGKKYKQCHGRLQ	In this study, a series of N-terminally and C-terminally truncated variants also expressed and refolded - see paper for details	P10408			7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11074254	Identification, cloning, and characterization of a major cat flea salivary allergen (Cte f 1).	An 18 kDa protein isolated from saliva of the cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, elicits a positive intradermal skin test (IDST) in 100 and 800f experimental and clinical flea allergic dogs, respectively. Using solid-phase enzyme-linked immuno assay (ELISA), this protein detected IgE in 100 and 800f experimental and clinical flea allergic dogs, respectively. A cDNA (pFSI) encoding a full-length Cte f 1 protein was isolated from a C. felis salivary gland cDNA library, using a combination of PCR and hybridization screening. This cDNA is 658 bp in length, and contains an open reading frame of 528 bp. The open reading frame encodes a protein of 176 amino acids, consisting of an 18 amino acid signal sequence and a 158 amino acid mature protein. The calculated molecular weight and pI of the mature protein are 18106 Da and 9.3, respectively. The protein, named Cte f 1, is the first novel major allergen described for canine flea allergy. Recombinant Cte f 1 (rCte f 1) was expressed in Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris and baculovirus infected Trichoplusia ni cells. Approximately, 900f the rCte f 1 expressed in E. coli accumulated in insoluble inclusion bodies, which could be refolded to a soluble mixture of disulfide isomers with partial IgE binding activity. Small quantities of an apparently correctly refolded form of rCte f 1, which had IgE binding activity equal to the native antigen, was isolated from the soluble fraction of E. coli cells. However, P. pastoris and baculovirus infected insect cells expressed and secreted a fully processed, correctly refolded and fully active form of rCte f 1. Mass spectrometry analysis of the active forms of rCte f 1confirmed that eight intact disulfide bonds were present, matching the number observed in the native allergen. The relative ability of rCte f 1 to bind IgE in the serum of flea allergic animals, produced in these three expression systems, matched that of the native allergen.

10336874	Folding and purification of a recombinantly expressed interferon regulatory factor, IRF-4.	Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF-4), an intracellular, multidomain protein, is a member of the interferon regulatory factor family and a lymphoid-specific transcription factor that can form a ternary complex with DNA and the transcription factor PU.1. Recombinant human IRF-4 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from the soluble cell extract and the insoluble inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized with guanidinium-hydrochloride and sequentially buffer exchanged into urea- and then NaCl-containing solutions. This two-step process for the removal of the denaturants was the critical step to allow for the correct folding of IRF-4. Following purification through immobilized metal affinity, hydrophobic interaction, and gel permeation chromatographies, the renatured protein was shown to be structurally and physically equivalent to a sample of IRF-4 produced in the soluble fraction of E. coli cells. This was confirmed by near and far UV circular dichroism analysis, including thermal stability analysis. The purified IRF-4 was also shown to be capable of binding DNA in a PU.1-dependent manner by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. The protein folding and purification methods are suitable for producing large quantities of full-length IRF-4.	1999 Jun	Moellering B J,Yoshinaga S K,Hui A,Delaney J M,Hara S,Narhi L O,Westcott K R	Protein expression and purification. 16(1) 160-70	Interferon regulatory factor 4	MNLEGGGRGGEFGMSAVSCGNGKLRQWLIDQIDSGKYPGLVWENEEKSIFRIPWKHAGKQDYNREEDAALFKAWALFKGKFREGIDKPDPPTWKTRLRCALNKSNDFEELVERSQLDISDPYKVYRIVPEGAKKGAKQLTLEDPQMSMSHPYTMTTPYPSLPAQQVHNYMMPPLDRSWRDYVPDQPHPEIPYQCPMTFGPRGHHWQGPACENGCQVTGTFYACAPPESQAPGVPTEPSIRSAEALAFSDCRLHICLYYREILVKELTTSSPEGCRISHGHTYDASNLDQVLFPYPEDNGQRKNIEKLLSHLERGVVLWMAPDGLYAKRLCQSRIYWDGPLALCNDRPNKLERDQTCKLFDTQQFLSELQAFAHHGRSLPRFQVTLCFGEEFPDPQRQRKLITAHVEPLLARQLYYFAQQNSGHFLRGYDLPEHISNPEDYHRSIRHSSIQE	Sequence does not include N-terminal his tag,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q15306			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
8849322	Specificity and binding affinity of an anti-crotoxin combinatorial antibody selected from a phage-displayed library.	A crotoxin-specific, monoclonal, high-affinity, single-chain antibody variable region (scFv) was generated by combinatorial methods using Pharmacia&#39;s Recombinant Phage Antibody System. A high-affinity clone, designated A10G, was selected, and its DNA sequence was determined. Protein A10G showed high reaction specificity, with only the closely related rattlesnake neurotoxins, concolor toxin and Mojave toxin, showing cross-reactivity out of eleven group II phospholipase A2s (PLA2s) screened. No group I PLA2s cross-reacted in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The gene coding for A10G was subcloned into an expression vector, and the resulting expressed nonfusion protein, designated A10GPE, was renatured and purified to apparent homogeneity. Dissociation constants of A10G with intact crotoxin and crotoxin basic subunit were determined to be 7 x 10(-10) and 6.8 x 10(-9) M, respectively. When A10GPE was preincubated with either the basic subunit or intact crotoxin at molar ratios of up to 5:1, no inhibition of phospholipase activity was observed. Expressed protein, however, could partially neutralize the lethality of Mojave toxin, a crotoxin homolog, in mice.	1995 Dec	Meng J,John T R,Kaiser I I	Biochemical pharmacology. 50(12) 1969-77	scFv anti-crotoxin	maqvklqqsgaelvrsgasvklsctasgfnikdyymnwvkqrpeqglewigwidpengdteyapkfqgkatmtadtssntaylqlssltsedtavyycnvgyygssslfdywgqdieltqspttmaaspgekititcsanssissnylhwyqqkpgfspklliyrtsnlasgvparfsgsgsgtsysltigtmeaedvatyycqlgnsiprtfgggtkleikr	See GenBank accession numbers U14531 and U14532 for V(h) and V(l) chains				7.4	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

A T7 polymerase expression system was used, resulting in the formation of insoluble cytoplasmic protein aggregates. The recombinant products were resolubilized, renatured and purified to homogeneity. The exchange activity of the refolded hGRF samples on H-Ras was comparable with that published for the soluble catalytic domain of the mouse counterpart, CDC25 Mm. Both p55-hGRF and p39-hGRF form dimers. We established a procedure to prepare and purify the complex with Ras. The results of the characterization study are consistent with a stoichiometry of 1:1 and an equilibrium between dimeric and monomeric forms of the complex.	1999 Aug	Meyer P,Janin J,Baudet-Nessler S	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 263(3) 806-16	p55-hGRF (truncated form of Ras-GDP exchange factor)	PDQRNGDKEFVIRRAATNRVLNVLRHWVSKHSQDFETNDELKCKVIGFLEEVMHDPELLTQERKAAANIIRTLTQEDPGDNQITLEEITQMAEGVKAEPFENHSALEIAEQLTLLDHLVFKKIPYEEFFGQGWMKLEKNERTPYIMKTTKHFNDISNLIASEIIRNEDINARVSAIEKWVAVADICRCLHNYNAVLEITSSMNRSAIFRLKKTWLKVSKQTKALIDKLQKLVSSEGRFKNLREALKNCDPPCVPYLGMYLTDLAFIEEGTPNYTEDGLVNFSKMRMISHIIREIRQFQQTAYKIEHQAKVTQYLLDQSFVMDEESLYESSLRIEPKLPT		Q13972		shorter construct p39-hGRF - C-terminal 339 residues of the protein	7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
1624793	Cloning and expression of recombinant Aspergillus fumigatus allergen I/a (rAsp f I/a) with IgE binding and type I skin test activity.	Aspergillus fumigatus secretes an 18-kDa nonglycosylated IgE-binding protein. This protein was previously shown to be a ribotoxin, like alpha-sarcin and mitogillin. A 686-bp long A. fumigatus cDNA encoding an 18-kDa ribotoxin was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with six adjacent histidines (rAsp f I/a). rAsp f I/a was purified to homogeneity by Ni(2+)-chelate affinity chromatography and refolded. The recombinant protein was enzymatically active resulting in the cleavage of 28S rRNA within a universally conserved region. rAsp f I/a was cytotoxic for EBV immortalized or PHA stimulated human PBMC. Furthermore, rAsp f I/a was recognized by murine mAb made against an 18-kDa ribotoxin. IgE of individuals allergic to A. fumigatus bound to rAsp f I/a as shown by ELISA, dot blots, and Western blots. rAsp f I/a elicited positive immediate type I skin reactions in individuals allergic to A. fumigatus but not in healthy control individuals. The results show that rAsp f I/a has similar functional characteristics when compared to the native 18-kDa ribotoxin. rAsp f I/a expressed in E. coli can therefore be used as a standardized Ag/allergen for serologic and clinical diagnosis of A. fumigatus-associated diseases.	1992 Jul	Moser M,Crameri R,Menz G,Schneider T,Dudler T,Virchow C,Gmachl M,Blaser K,Suter M	Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950). 149(2) 454-60	Major allergen Asp F1	MRGSHHHHHHGSATWTCINQQLNPKTNKWEDKRLLYSQAKAESNSHHAPLSDGKTGSSYPHWFTNGYDGNGKLIKGRTPIKFGKADCDRPPKHSQNGMGKDDHYLLEFPTFPDGHDYKFDSKKPKEDPGPARVIYTYPNKVFCGIVAHQRGNQGDLRLCS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P67875			7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8112866	Recombinant expression and antigenic properties of a 32-kilodalton extracellular alkaline protease, representing a possible virulence factor from Aspergillus fumigatus.	A 32-kDa nonglycosylated alkaline protease (EC 3.4.1.14) with elastolytic activity, secreted by the opportunistic pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 42202, is suggested to be a virulence factor of this fungus. The enzyme is a serine protease of the subtilisin family, and its cDNA nucleotide sequence has recently been reported. We have cloned the cDNA encoding the mature protease into a high-level Escherichia coli expression plasmid and produced the recombinant protease as a fusion protein with a six-adjacent-histidine affinity tag at the carboxy terminus. Subsequently, the recombinant protease was purified to homogeneity, with affinity chromatography yielding 30 to 40 mg of recombinant protease per liter of E. coli culture. Refolded recombinant protease, in comparison with native protease, demonstrated weak enzymatic activity but similar immunochemical characteristics as analyzed by antigen-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), competition ELISA, and immunoblotting assays. To assess the allergenic potential of the protease, sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and sera from healthy control individuals were analyzed by ELISA and immunoblotting techniques. Sera from patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis did not have protease-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and, remarkably, did not show significantly elevated protease-specific IgG antibody levels compared with those in sera from healthy control individuals. This suggests that the alkaline protease from A. fumigatus does not elicit IgE antibodies and has weak immunogenicity, a property which may explain fungus persistence in allergic individuals.	1994 Mar	Moser M,Menz G,Blaser K,Crameri R	Infection and immunity. 62(3) 936-42	Alkaline protease	MRGSALTTQRGAPWGLGSISHKGQASTDYIYDTSAGAGTYAYVVDTGINVNHVEFEGRASLAYNAAGGSHVDSVGHGTHVAGTIGGKTYGVAKKTNLLSVKVFQGESSSTSIILDGFNWAANDIVSKGRTRKAAINMSLGGGYSYAFNNAVENAFDEGVLSVVAAGNENTDASETSPASAPNALTVAAINRSNARASFSNYGSVVDIFAPGQDILSAWIGSNTATNTISGTSMATPHIVGLSVYLMGLENLSGPAAVTSRIKQLATNGVVTDTRGSPNKLAYNGNATSRSHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	O74264			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
10382758	Structure-activity relationships within the N-terminal short consensus repeats (SCR) of human CR1 (C3b/C4b receptor, CD35): SCR 3 plays a critical role in inhibition of the classical and alternative pathways of complement activation.	Genes coding for between one and four short consensus repeats (SCR) of the N-terminal region of human complement receptor 1 (CR1) were synthesized from oligonucleotides and those encoding SCR(1-2), SCR(1-3), SCR(1-4), SCR3 and SCR(3-4) were expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Following solubilization in urea, the proteins were partially purified and refolded and the activity of each protein was assessed in both classical and alternative pathway complement assays. All fragments showed a varying degree of activity with the general order being SCR(1-3) = SCR(1-4) &gt; SCR(1-2). Addition of SCR3 to SCR(1-2) significantly improved potency, whereas the addition of SCR4 conferred no additional benefit. This observation, coupled with the ability of the single-domain SCR3 to inhibit classical pathway mediated lysis with an IH50% (inhibition of hemolysis by 50%) of 4.8 microM, demonstrates that SCR3 provides key binding interactions with activated complement components. SCR(1-3) was able to inhibit both classical and alternative pathways of complement activation, showing that the N-terminal SCR of CR1 retain the ability to interact with C3b. Assays for CR1-like cofactor activity for factor I using C4b-like C4 or C3b-like C3 as substrates showed that SCR(1-3) possessed such cofactor activity and that C4b-like C4 was a better substrate. When compared to full-length (30 SCR) soluble CR1 (sCR1), SCR(1-3) was significantly less potent in accord with a model involving multi-valent binding of C3b/C4b to CR1.	1999 Jun	Mossakowska D,Dodd I,Pindar W,Smith R A	European journal of immunology. 29(6) 1955-65	Complement receptor type1	MIPCGLPPTITNGDFISTNRENFHYGSVVTYRCNPGSGGRKVFELVGEPSIYCTSNDDQVGIWSGPAPQCIIPNK		P17927		N-terminal domain Short Consensus repeat 3, aa.122-196 	9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8746624	Overexpression in Escherichia coli, folding, purification, and characterization of the first three short consensus repeat modules of human complement receptor type 1.	We have developed a simple expression, isolation, and folding protocol for an SCR oligomer comprising the first three SCRs of complement receptor Type 1 (C3b/C4b receptor, CD35). A T7 RNA polymerase expression system in Escherichia coli was used to express the oligomer as inclusion bodies. The oligomer was recovered from solubilized inclusion bodies using batch adsorption on SP-Sepharose. The oligomer was folded by one-step dilution in 20 mM ethanolamine/1 mM EDTA supplemented with 1 mM GSH/0.5 mM GSSG. The folded material was processed to a concentrated (&gt; 20 mg/ml), usable product of greater than 98d0c850urity using a combination of ultrafiltration, ammonium sulfate treatment, hydrophobic interaction, and size-exclusion chromatography. The yield of folded material varied between 6 and 15 mg/liter culture. The oxidation states of the 12 cysteine residues in SCR(1-3) were identified by HPLC of peptide fragments from a tryptic digest using dual UV/fluorescence detection, collection of selected peaks, and N-terminal sequencing. This methodology confirmed the expected location of disulfide bridges. Equilibrium and velocity sedimentation studies are interpreted in terms of a single sedimenting species with molecular weights of 21,629 and 21,063 by these respective techniques. These values compare to the predicted molecular weight, from amino acid composition, of 21,817. The hydrodynamic properties of the molecule indicate that it is asymmetric with an axial ratio of 1:5.2 or equivalent dimensions of 21 x 110 A. SCR(1-3) has an unusual CD spectrum exhibiting a broad maximum at 220-230 nm and a minimum at 190 nm. There was little evidence of classical secondary structure. The product exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of complement-mediated lysis of sensitized sheep red blood cells.	1995 Dec	Dodd I,Mossakowska D E,Camilleri P,Haran M,Hensley P,Lawlor E J,McBay D L,Pindar W,Smith R A	Protein expression and purification. 6(6) 727-36	Complement receptor type1	QCNAPEWLPFARPTNLTDEFEFPIGTYLNYECRPGYSGRPFSIICLKNSVWTGAKDRCRRKSCRNPPDPVNGMVHVIKGIQFGSQIKYSCTKGYRLIGSSSATCIISGDTVIWDNETPICDRIPCGLPPTITNGDFISTNRENFHYGSVVTYRCNPGSGGRKVFELVGEPSIYCTSNDDQVGIWSGPAPQCIIPNK		P17927		Short consensus repeat modules 1-3, aa1-196	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

7756833	Hyperexpressed EcoRII renatured from inclusion bodies and native enzyme both exhibit essential cooperativity with two DNA sites.	EcoRII was the first restriction endonuclease (ENase) reported needing the cooperative interaction with at least two DNA sites for activity. We constructed an EcoRII-overproducing strain of Escherichia coli by placing the coding sequence under control of the T7 gene 10 regulatory elements. The yield of EcoRII expression could be increased to about 100f total soluble cellular protein. Inclusion bodies are formed that mainly consist of insoluble EcoRII molecules. After solubilization by 6 M guanidine hydrochloride refolding of the enzyme was achieved by dilution into appropriate buffer. The endonuclease was purified to homogeneity from both the soluble protein fraction and the protein renatured from inclusion bodies. Their identity was proven by circular dichroism and analysis of enzyme activity with respect to the special substrate requirements of EcoRII. It is shown that EcoRII cleavage of oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes (oligo duplexes) with only one recognition site follows a sigmoidal concentration dependence, i.e., they cannot be cleaved below a distinct low DNA concentration where simultaneous interaction with two substrate molecules is no longer possible. We demonstrate that the restriction of oligo duplexes containing two recognition sites does not show this concentration dependence, confirming an intramolecular site cooperativity.	1995 Feb	Kupper D,Reuter M,Mackeldanz P,Meisel A,Alves J,Schroeder C,Krüger D H	Protein expression and purification. 6(1) 1-9	Pro-Falcipain-2			Q9NBD4		None	7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10766247	XCDT1 is required for the assembly of pre-replicative complexes in Xenopus laevis.	In eukaryotic cells, chromosomal DNA replication begins with the formation of pre-replication complexes at replication origins. Formation and maintenance of pre-replication complexes is dependent upon CDC6 (ref. 1), a protein which allows assembly of MCM2-7 proteins, which are putative replicative helicases. The functional assembly of MCM proteins into chromatin corresponds to replication licensing. Removal of these proteins from chromatin in S phase is crucial in origins firing regulation. We have identified a protein that is required for the assembly of pre-replication complexes, in a screen for maternally expressed genes in Xenopus. This factor (XCDT1) is a relative of fission yeast cdt1, a protein proposed to function in DNA replication, and is the first to be identified in vertebrates. Here we show, using Xenopus in vitro systems, that XCDT1 is required for chromosomal DNA replication. XCDT1 associates with pre-replicative chromatin in a manner dependent on ORC protein and is removed from chromatin at the time of initiation of DNA synthesis. Immunodepletion and reconstitution experiments show that XCDT1 is required to load MCM2-7 proteins onto pre-replicative chromatin. These findings indicate that XCDT1 is an essential component of the system that regulates origins firing during S phase.	2000 Apr	Maiorano D,Moreau J,Méchali M	Nature. 404(6778) 622-5	CDC10-dependent transcription 1	MADMSQMRVTDFFSQSKRGTAAQNSKGRKVEAVLETRRAVTRSRAASVKAEEFLKAPCTPERASPTVSQCIGPSSKKRTRQDSDSEPLRTQQRQGKSARKKLKLPEGEHGGSVQQQLFSPCNKVALEHVTPSSLGKKIKDMVNVSLSPKFNELARNPTTPETKSPAKENLLELKSRLQRIQELAQKVNLPAASSEGKVTITDLKARLKRAQELDTKIRAKAEKTETQAIDLTEQPAQESEKAPAYQRFHNLAQDAAPGLTLPYKYKVLAEMFRSMDTIVGMLFNRSETITFSKVKQGVQDMMRKQFEQRNVGQIKTVYPNAYKYRQEKNIPTFKDGVKKTDYQLTIEPLVAEGDMLSGRPHLSASRLLERKQLFHRSLTSIVKQHHRVFLTSLNPPMLVPDDKLTRWHPRFNVDEVLDVTPAELPLPPQVERLTTAQEVLSKARGLITPKMEKALANLALKTAENAGETKNVSTEETKSTATTSTSTALKGVSQSLLERIRAKEAQKLQAIMTRRPQQEERLLMMSRLPELARILRNVFVAEKKPALTLEVTCSRVIASCRSSMSPGEMEKHLALLSEILPDWLSIHPVRKDTYYKLNQSMDLNLILERLAKKTKEEESL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9I9A7			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
3518228	Changes in the nucleoprotein complexes of a baculovirus DNA during infection.	The nature of the DNA-protein complexes assumed by Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) DNA during infection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells was investigated by micrococcal nuclease digestion of infected nuclei. Both parental viral DNA and progeny viral DNA assumed a chromatin-like structure early in infection. By late times (24 hr) p.i., the viral DNA acquired a unique nucleoprotein structure. In addition to fragments of mononucleosome size (185 bp), two subnucleosomal bands of 120 and 90 bp were observed. The subnucleosomal bands contained exclusively viral DNA. No alteration in the nature of the host chromatin structure following AcNPV infection was observed. An examination of the basic chromatin-associated proteins revealed two major viral-induced proteins having molecular weights of 15K and 39K. The induction of the basic 15K protein between 10 and 24 hr p.i. coincided with the appearance of the altered nucleoprotein structure observed by 24 hr p.i. and the cessation of histone synthesis.	1986 Jun	Wilson M E,Miller L K	Virology. 151(2) 315-28	Minichromosome maintenance 8	MSQGWRGGSGGWRGGGGGGGNPYAGAWRGRPWRGRGQGGTWSRNNGRDPVCFAPPKPQLTQTTLDKYIPYKGWKLYFSEAYSDNSPFLEKVRAFEKFFKKQIELYDKDEIERKGSILVDYKELLQDEDLSASIPLSSELKDMPEKVLECMGLAIHQVLTKDLETHAADLQQQEGLRTEEAPIVNVPFIHARVFNYDTLTSLKNLRASLYGKYVALRGTVVRVGNIKPLCTKMAFSCNMCGDIQCFPLPDGKYTVPTKCPVPECRGRSFTANRSSPLTVTVDWQTIKVQELMSDDQREAGRIPRTVECELIQDLVDSCVPGDMITVTGIVKVSNTRDGGFKNKNNKCMFLLYIEANSVSNSKGQKGKSTEDSGNHGASMDFSLKDLYAIQEIQSQENLFQLIVNSLCPTIYGHELVKAGLSLALFGGCQKYADDKNRIPIRGDPHILVVGDPGLGKSQMLQAVCNVAPRGVYVCGNTTTTSGLTVTLSRDTTTGDFGLEAGALVLGDQGICGIDEFDKMGNQHQALLEAMEQQSISLAKAGIVCSLPARTSIIAAANPVGGHYNKGKTVSENLKMGSALLSRFDLVFILVDTPNEDHDHLLSEHVMAMRSGAKEIQSVDITRINTQNSNTSILEVPSERPLGERLKLRTGEHFDALPHQLLRKFVGYARQYVHPSLSPDAAQILQDFYLELRKQNQGIDSTPITTRQLESLIRLTEARARLELREKATKEDAEEVVQIMKYSLLGTFSDEFGKLDFQRSQHGSGMSNRSKAKKFVSALNRVAEQTYNNLFEFQQLRQIARELQIQVIDFEAFIGSLNDQGYLLKKGPRVFQLQTM	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q5F310			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9224699	Disulfide bond formation is not involved in cap-binding activity of Xenopus translation initiation factor eIF-4E.	The eukaryotic initiation factor eIF-4E from Xenopus laevis was expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded in an active form. To define the cysteine residues forming a disulfide bond in Xenopus eIF-4E, each of the 3 cysteine residues was changed to serine by site-directed mutagenesis. Cap-binding activities of the mutant proteins were evaluated by 7-methyl-GTP(m7GTP)-affinity column chromatography. Even the mutant protein containing no cysteine showed an affinity for m7GTP. From the above results and the estimation of the sulfhydryl groups by Ellman&#39;s assay method, we concluded that a disulfide bond is not involved in the active Xenopus eIF-4E.	1997 Jun	Wakiyama M,Sakai N,Kojima S,Miura K	FEBS letters. 409(3) 407-10	translation initiation factor eIF-4E	MAAVEPENTNPQSTEEEKETGQEIVSPDQYIKHPLQNRWALWFFKNDKSKTWQANLRLISKFDTVEDFWALYNHIQLSSNLMSGCDYSLFKDGIEPMWEDEKNKRGGRWLITLNKQQRRNDLDRFWLETLMCLIGESFDEHSDDVCGAVVNVRAKGDKIAIWTTEFENKDAVTHIGRVYKERLGLPAKVVIGYQSHADTATKSGSTTKNRFVV		P48597			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16027123	Heparin-binding sites in granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Localization and regulation by histidine ionization.	The biological activity of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is modulated by the sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) heparan sulfate and heparin. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in such interactions are still not completely understood. We have proposed previously that helix C, one of the four alpha-helices of human GM-CSF (hGM-CSF), contains a GAG-binding site in which positively charged residues are spatially positioned for interaction with the sulfate moieties of the GAGs (Wettreich, A., Sebollela, A., Carvalho, M. A., Azevedo, S. P., Borojevic, R., Ferreira, S. T., and Coelho-Sampaio, T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 31468-31475). Protonation of two histidine residues (His83 and His87) in helix C of hGM-CSF appears to act as a pH-dependent molecular switch to control the interaction with GAGs. Based on these findings, we have now generated a triple mutant form of murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF) in which three noncharged residues in helix C of the murine factor (Tyr83, Gln85, and Tyr87) were replaced by the corresponding basic residues present in hGM-CSF (His83, Lys85, and His87). Binding assays on heparin-Sepharose showed that, at acidic pH, the triple mutant mGM-CSF binds to immobilized heparin with significantly higher affinity than wild type (WT) mGM-CSF and that neither protein binds to the column at neutral pH. The fact that even WT mGM-CSF binds to heparin at acidic pH indicates the existence of a distinct, lower affinity heparin-binding site in the protein. Chemical modification of the single histidine residue (His15) located in helix A of WT mGM-CSF with diethyl pyrocarbonate totally abolished binding to immobilized heparin. Moreover, replacement of His15 for an alanine residue significantly reduced the affinity of mGM-CSF for heparin at pH 5.0 and completely blocked heparin binding to a synthetic peptide corresponding to helix A of GM-CSF. These results indicate a major role of histidine residues in the regulation of the binding of GM-CSF to GAGs, supporting the notion that an acidic microenvironment is required for GM-CSF-dependent regulation of target cells. In addition, our results provide insight into the molecular basis of the strict species specificity of the biological activity of GM-CSF.	2005 Sep	Sebollela Adriano,Cagliari Thiago C,Limaverde Gabriel S C S,Chapeaurouge Alex,Sorgine Marcos H F,Coelho-Sampaio Tatiana,Ramos Carlos H I,Ferreira Sérgio T	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(36) 31949-56	granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor	APTRSPITVTRPWKHVEAIKEALNLLDDMPVTLNEEVEVVSNEFSFKKLTCVQTRLKIFEQGLRGNFTKLKGALNMTASYYQTYCPPTPETDCETQVTTYADFIDSLKTFLTDIPFECKKPGQK	N-terminal GST	P01587			7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15063772	An efficient system for small protein expression and refolding.	The low expression yield and poor refolding efficiency of small recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli have continued to hinder the large-scale purification of such proteins for structural and biological investigations. A system based on a small fusion partner, the B1 domain of Streptococcal protein G (GB1), was utilized to overcome this problem. We have tested this system on a small cysteine-rich toxin, mutant myotoxin alpha (MyoP20G). The highly expressed fusion protein was refolded using an unfolding/refolding protocol. Due to the small size of GB1, we were able to monitor the unfolding/refolding status by heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) NMR spectroscopy. The final product yielded well-resolved NMR spectra, with a topology corresponding to the natural product. We conclude that GB1 not only increases the expression level but also enhances the refolding of small proteins.	2004 Apr	Cheng Yuan,Patel Dinshaw J	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 317(2) 401-5	Myotoxin alpha	YKQCHKKGGHCFPKEKICIPPSSDLGKMDCRWKWKCCKKGSG	B1 domain of Streptococcal protein G	P01476			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
10049722	cDNA cloning and expression of acutin.	Acutin, a thrombin-like enzyme was purified from Agkistrodon acutus venom in three steps by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, Superose 12 column on FPLC and Mono-Q column chromatographies. Its first 15 N-terminal amino acid residues sequence &lt;VIGGVECDINEHRFL&gt; was then determined and the acutin cDNA was isolated from venom gland total RNA using RT-PCR. Determination of its nucleotide sequence allowed elucidation of the amino acid sequence of mature peptide for the first time. The mature acutin has 233 amino acids and its amino acid sequence exhibits significant homology with those of thrombin-like enzymes from crotaline snakes venoms. Based on the homology, the catalytic residues and disulfide bridges of acutin were deduced to be as follows: catalytic residues, His41, Asp84 and Ser179; and disulfide bridges, Cys7-Cys139, Cys26-Cys42, Cys74-Cys231, Cys118-Cys185, Cys150-Cys164, Cys175-Cys200. The recombinant acutin has been expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity column. The renatured recombinant acutin is reported for the first time to have the activity of clotting fibrinogen and arginine-esterase.	1999 Feb	Pan H,Du X,Yang G,Zhou Y,Wu X	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 255(2) 412-5	Acutin	MVIGGDECDINEHRFLVAFFNTTGFFCGGTLINPEWVVTAAHCDSTNFQMQLGVHSKKVLNEDEQTRNPKEKFICPNKNNNEVLDKDIMLIKLDKPISNSKHIAPLSLPSSPPSVGSVCRIMGWGSITPVKETFPDVPYCANINLLDHAVCQTGYPSCWRNTTLCAGFLEGGKDTCGGDSGGPLICNGQFQGIVSYGAHSCGQGPKPGIYTNVFDYTDWIQRNIAGNTDATCPPLEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9YGS1			7.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11162397	Purification and in vitro folding of recombinant human thrombopoietin receptor expressed in Escherichia coli.	Thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR) is a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily expressed primarily on hematopoietic cells. TPOR plays an important role in regulating platelet production. Due to its low expression level in human tissue, studies on the biochemical and biophysical properties of TPOR have been limited. In the present study, an extracellular domain of recombinant human TPOR (rh TPOR-EN) was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Purification was achieved by metal chelated chromatography under denaturing condition and was refolded by gel filtration chromatography. Far UV circular dichroism spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed to demonstrate that the protein was in a refolded state and could bind with its ligand. Thus, a production and purification scheme was developed by which sufficient quantities of rh TPOR-EN can be made available for biochemical and biophysical characterizations.	2001 Feb	Ng C K,Huxtable S,Xu P,Hsieh D P	Protein expression and purification. 21(1) 129-33	Thrombopoietin receptor	MHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSGMKETAAAKFERQHMDSPDLGTDDDDKAMADIGSDQDVSLLASDSEPLKCFSRTFEDLTCFWDEEEAAPSGTYQLLYAYPREKPRACPLSSQSMPHFGTRYVCQFPDQEEVRLFFPLHLWVKNVFLNQTRTQRVLFVDSVGLPAPPSIIKAMGGSQPGELQISWEEPAPEISDFLRYELRYGPRDPKNSTGPTVIQLIATETCCPALQRPHSASALDQSPCAQPTMPWQDGPKQTSPSREASALTAEGGSCLISGLQPGNSYWLQLRSEPDGISLGGSWGSWSLPVTVDLPGDAVALGLQCFTLDLKNVTCQWQQQDHASSQGFFYHSRARCCPRDRYPIWENCEEEEKTNPGLQTPQFSRCHFKSRNDSIIHILVEVTTAPGTVHSYLGSPFWIHQAVRLPTPNLHWREISSGHLELEWQHPSSWAAQETCYQLRYTGEGHQDWKVLEPPLGARGGTLELRPRSRYRLQLRARLNGPTYQGPWSSWSDPTRVETATETA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P40238			7.4	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9430670	Independent folding and ligand specificity of the C2 calcium-dependent lipid binding domain of cytosolic phospholipase A2.	The Ca(2+)-dependent lipid binding domain of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is a homolog of C2 domains present in protein kinase C, synaptotagmin, and numerous other proteins involved in signal transduction. NH2-terminal fragments of cPLA2 spanning the C2 domain were expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, extracted with solvent to remove phospholipids, and refolded to yield a domain capable of binding phospholipid vesicles in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Unlike other C2 domains characterized to date, the cPLA2 C2 domain bound preferentially to vesicles comprised of phosphatidylcholine in response to physiological concentrations of Ca2+. Binding of the cPLA2 C2 domain to vesicles in the presence of excess Ca2+ chelator was induced by high concentrations of salts that promote hydrophobic interactions. Despite the selective hydrolysis of arachidonyl-containing phospholipid vesicles by cPLA2, the cPLA2 C2 domain did not discriminate among phospholipid vesicles containing saturated or unsaturated sn-2 fatty acyl chains. Moreover, the cPLA2 C2 domain bound to phospholipid vesicles containing sn-1 and -2 ether linkages and sphingomyelin at Ca2+ concentrations that caused binding to vesicles containing ester linkages, demonstrating that the carbonyl oxygens of the sn-1 and -2 ester linkage are not critical for binding. These results suggest that the cPLA2 C2 domain interacts primarily with the headgroup of the phospholipid. The cPLA2 C2 domain displayed selectivity among group IIA cations, preferring Ca2+ approximately 50-fold over Sr2+ and nearly 10,000-fold over Ba2+ for vesicle binding. No binding to vesicles was observed in the presence of greater than 10 mM Mg2+. Such strong selectivity for Ca2+ over Mg2+ reinforces the view that C2 domains link second messenger Ca2+ to signal transduction events at the membrane.	1998 Jan	Nalefski E A,McDonagh T,Somers W,Seehra J,Falke J J,Clark J D	The Journal of biological chemistry. 273(3) 1365-72	Cytosolic phospholipase A2	MSFIDPYQHIIVEHQYSHKFTVVVLRATKVTKGAFGDMLDTPDPYVELFISTTPDSRKRTRHFNNDINPVWNETFEFILDPNQENVLEITLMDANYVMDETLGTATFTVSSMKVGEKKEVPFIFNQVTEMVLEMSLEVCSCPDLRFSMALCDQEKTFRQQRKEHIRESMKKLLGPKNS	Other versions of truncated C2 domain expressed and refolded:aa.1-126MSFIDPYQHI IVEHQYSHKF TVVVLRATKV TKGAFGDMLD TPDPYVELFI  50STTPDSRKRT RHFNNDINPV WNETFEFILD PNQENVLEIT LMDANYVMDE 100TLGTATFTVS SMKVGEKKEV PFIFNQNumber of amino acids: 126Molecular weight: 14594.5Theoretical pI: 4.93aa.1-138MSFIDPYQHI IVEHQYSHKF TVVVLRATKV TKGAFGDMLD TPDPYVELFI  50STTPDSRKRT RHFNNDINPV WNETFEFILD PNQENVLEIT LMDANYVMDE 100TLGTATFTVS SMKVGEKKEV PFIFNQVTEM VLEMSLEVNumber of amino acids: 138Molecular weight: 15956.1Theoretical pI: 4.68aa.1-155MSFIDPYQHI IVEHQYSHKF TVVVLRATKV TKGAFGDMLD TPDPYVELFI  50STTPDSRKRT RHFNNDINPV WNETFEFILD PNQENVLEIT LMDANYVMDE 100TLGTATFTVS SMKVGEKKEV PFIFNQVTEM VLEMSLEVCS CPDLRFSMAL 150CDQEKNumber of amino acids: 155Molecular weight: 17884.4Theoretical pI: 4.66,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P47712		Truncated C2 domain aa.1-178	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11388800	Recombinant expression of biologically active rat leptin in Escherichia coli.	Leptin is a 16-kDa nonglycosylated hormone that is produced in mature adipocytes and which acts primarily in the hypothalamus to reduce food intake and body weight. While the rat is a representative laboratory animal model in obesity research, so far recombinant rat leptin was not available. In the present study, rat leptin was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli and purified in a bioactive form to provide a further tool for the analysis of leptin functions in rats. Leptin cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR from total RNA of SD rat adipocytes, and overexpression was achieved by subcloning the leptin cDNA into the pET-29a vector, which enabled the recombinant expression of rat leptin as an S-peptide-tagged fusion protein. Since the fusion proteins were expressed in inclusion bodies, after purification of the insoluble fraction, leptin proteins were refolded by sequential dialysis into physiological buffers. The biological activity of this recombinant protein was confirmed in proliferation assays using leptin-sensitive rat insulinoma cells as well as a newly developed leptin-sensitive luciferase assay system. The specific binding of the S-tagged leptin to leptin-receptor-expressing cells was further shown by flow cytometry using fluorescence-conjugated S-proteins.	2001 Jun	Park J H,Lee H H,Na S Y,Ju S K,Lee Y J,Lee M K,Kim K L	Protein expression and purification. 22(1) 60-9	Leptin	MKETAAAKFERQHMDSPDLGTLVPRGSMADIVPIHKVQDDTKTLIKTIVTRINDISHTQSVSARQRVTGLDFIPGLHPILSLSKMDQTLAVYQQILTSLPSQNVLQIAHDLENLRDLLHLLAFSKSCSLPQTRGLQKPESLDGVLEASLYSTEVVALSRLQGSLQDILQQLDLSPEC	N-terminal S-tag	P50596			7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8180210	Recombinant human CNTF receptor alpha: production, binding stoichiometry, and characterization of its activity as a diffusible factor.	The primary ligand-binding protein (CNTFR alpha) of the multicomponent receptor for ciliary neurotrophic factor was produced in Escherichia coli. Using novel applications of size-exclusion chromatography and a protein gel-shift assay, we obtained quantitative separation of correctly refolded protein, as well as analytical monitoring of the refolding process and ligand binding. By these and other methods, we determined a 1:1 stoichiometry for the receptor-ligand complex. To investigate the proposed activity and mechanism of soluble CNTFR alpha as a diffusible factor, we studied the response of TF-1 cells which lack CNTFR alpha to various CNTF ligands and the stimulation of this response by sCNTFR alpha. The results show that sCNTFR alpha combines with CNTF and mediates cell survival with the same relative ligand specificity and relative affinity as the cell-surface form. Thus, soluble receptor can reconstitute on a cell surface active complexes that are analogous to the native complexes. Moreover, both the relative ligand potency in the absence of CNTFR alpha and the kinetics of the response to sCNTFR alpha indicate that the other components of the receptor complex contribute little, but measurably, to the specific potency of CNTF.	1994 May	Panayotatos N,Everdeen D,Liten A,Somogyi R,Acheson A	Biochemistry. 33(19) 5813-8	Ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha	MYAQRHSPQEAPHVQYERLGSDVTLPCGTANWDAAVTWRVNGTDLAPDLLNGSQLVLHGLELGHSGLYACFHRDSWHLRHQVLLHVGLPPREPVLSCRSNTYPKGFYCSWHLPTPTYIPNTFNVTVLHGSKIMVCEKDPALKNRCHIRYMHLFSTIKYKVSISVSNALGHNATAITFDEFTIVKPDPPENVVARPVPSNPRRLEVTWQTPSTWPDPESFPLKFFLRYRPLILDQWQHVELSDGTAHTITDAYAGKEYIIQVAAKDNEIGTWSDWSVAAHATPWTEEPRHLTTEAQAAETTTSTTSSLAPPPTTKICDPGELGSGGGPSAPFLVSVPITLALAAAAATASSLLI		P26992			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18338692	Histone as future drug target for malaria.	Malaria continues to be a major cause of mortality and morbidity in tropical countries and affecting around 100 countries of the world. As per WHO estimates, 300-500 million are being infected and 1-3 million deaths annually due to malaria. With the emerging knowledge about genome sequence of all the three counterparts involved in the disease of malaria, the parasite Plasmodium, vector Anopheles and host Homo sapien have helped the scientists to understand interactions between them. Simultaneous advancement in technology further improves the prospects to discover new targets for vaccines and drugs. Though the malaria vaccine is still far away in this situation there is need to develop a potent and affordable drug(s). Histones are the key protein of chromatin and play an important role in DNA packaging, replication and gene expression. They also show frequent post-translation modifications. The specific combinations of these posttranslational modifications are thought to alter chromatin structure by forming epigenetic bar codes that specify either transient or heritable patterns of genome function. Chromatin regulators and upstream pathways are therefore seen as promising targets for development of therapeutic drugs.	2007 Jun	Rawat D S,Lumb V,Sharma Y D,Pasha S T,Singh G	The Journal of communicable diseases. 39(2) 119-28	Neutrophil collagenase	MLTPGNPKWERTNLTYRIRNYTPQLSEAEVERAIKDAFELWSVASPLIFTRISQGEADINIAFYQRDHGDNSPFDGPNGILAHAFQPGQGIGGDAHFDAEETWTNTSANYNLFLVAAHEFGHSLGLAHSSDPGALMYPNYAFRETSNYSLPQDDIDGIQAIYG	Selenomethionine-labeled protein	P22894		aa.100-262	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1959605	Refolding of recombinant porcine growth hormone in a reducing environment limits in vitro aggregate formation.	Recombinant porcine growth hormone (rPGH) solubilized from bacterial inclusion bodies (IBs) using a cationic surfactant was oxidized to form disulphide bonds in a simple buffer solution containing 2-mercaptoethanol within an empirically derived optimal molar ratio of 2-mercaptoethanol:protein. A final yield of 55% monomeric rPGH was achieved at protein concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml without the need for removal of the 2-mercaptoethanol or the use of chaotrophic agents. In the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol only 15% monomeric rPGH was obtained, with the majority forming higher molecular weight aggregates. Using the procedure derived for porcine growth hormone, it may be possible to obtain high yields of native protein and overcome the need for using low protein concentrations and chaotrophic agents during in vitro refolding of other disulphide bonded recombinant proteins.	1991 Nov	Puri N K	FEBS letters. 292(1-2) 187-90	Growth Hormone	MAFPAMPLSSLFANAVLRAQHLHQLAADTYKEFERAYIPEGQRYSIQNAQAAFCFSETIPAPTGKDEAQQRSDVELLRFSLLLIQSWLGPVQFLSRVFTNSLVFGTSDRVYEKLKDLEEGIQALMRELEDGSPRAGQILKQTYDKFDTNLRSDDALLKNYGLLSCFKKDLHKAETYLRVMKCRRFVESSCAF		P01248			10	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
8188368	Expression of large amounts of neisserial porin proteins in Escherichia coli and refolding of the proteins into native trimers.	Porins from different neisserial strains and species have been shown to have differences in both primary amino acid sequence and biophysical characteristics as observed by functional assays. A closer examination of how the changes in the primary amino acid sequence of Neisseria porin molecules correlate with these observed biophysical changes has been impeded by the inability to easily manipulate the cloned porin genes by modern molecular techniques and then obtain enough of the expressed modified porin protein to purify and use in these biophysical functional assays. In this report, we describe a method by which the genes encoding three different porin proteins, lacking their neisserial promoter and signal sequences, were cloned into an expression plasmid and transformed into Escherichia coli. Upon induction, large amounts of the porin proteins were produced. The expressed porin proteins were then manipulated to regenerate their native trimer structure and purified by standard protein chemistry. Sufficient purified recombinant porin protein was obtained for further antigenic as well as biophysical characterization. This sets the stage for the biophysical characterization of these neisserial porin proteins in more detail.	1994 Jun	Qi H L,Tai J Y,Blake M S	Infection and immunity. 62(6) 2432-9	Major outer membrane protein P.IB	MASMTGGQQMGRDSSLVPSSVTLYGTIKAGVETSRSVFHQNGQVTEVTTATGIVDLGSKIGFKGQEDLGNGLKAIWQVEQKASIAGTDSGWGNRQSFIGLKGGFGKLRVGRLNSVLKDTGDINPWDSKSDYLGVNKIAEPEARLISVRYDSPEFAGLSGSVQYALNDNAGRHNSESYHAGFNYKNGGFFVQYGGAYKRHHQVQEGLNIEKYQIHRLVSGYDNDALYASVAVQQQDAKLTDASNSHNSQTEVAATLAYRFGNVTPRVSYAHGFKGLVDDADIGNEYDQVVVGAEYDFSKRTSALVSAGWLQEGKGENKFVATAGGVGLRHKF		P30690			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10890569	Recombinant prolactin receptor extracellular domain of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss): subcloning, preparation, and characterization.	The cDNA of the extracellular domain of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) prolactin receptor (trPRLR-ECD) was cloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pMON to enable its expression in Escherichia coli after induction with nalidixic acid. The bacterially expressed trPRLR-ECD protein, contained within the refractile body pellet, was solubilized in 4.5 M urea, refolded, and purified on a Q-Sepharose column, pH 8, by stepwise elution with NaCl. The bioactive monomeric 26-kDa fraction was eluted in 0.2 M NaCl, yielding 20 mg/2.5 L of induced culture. The purified protein was over 980mogeneous, as shown by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of reducing agent and by chromatography on a Superdex column. Binding experiments using [125I]ovine placental lactogen (oPL) as a ligand revealed that human growth hormone (hGH), oPL, and ovine prolactin (oPRL) were the most effective competitors, with respective IC50 values of 1.32, 2.27, and 2.70 nM. Chicken (ch) PRL did not compete at all, and homologous trPRL was much less effective, with a corresponding IC50 value of 1826 nM. Gel-filtration was used to determine the stoichiometry of trPRLR-ECD&#39;s interaction with oPL, hGH, and oPRL. Only oPL yielded a 2:1 complex, whereas hGH and oPRL formed only 1:1 complexes, with excess trPRLR-ECD being seen at the initial 2:1 trPRLR-ECD:hGH or trPRLR-ECD:oPRL ratios. No studies were performed with chPRL because of its inability to compete with [125I]oPL or with trPRL because of its low affinity toward trPRLR-ECD. The present results agree with previous findings indicating, as in mammals, that homologous PRL interacts transiently with its receptor and suggest that transient homologous PRL-induced homodimerization of the receptor is sufficient to initiate a biological signal, despite the fact that, in classical binding experiments, only low specific binding can be detected.	2000 May	Sandowski Y,Cohen Y,Le Rouzic P,Bignon C,Rentier-Delrue F,Djiane J,Prunet P,Gertler A	General and comparative endocrinology. 118(2) 302-9	Prolactin receptor extracellular domain	ARHTPPGKPKLTSCRSPDKETFTCWWEAGSDGGRPTTYSLFYHKENSETVYECPDYHTAGANSCFFNKNETSIWVNYNITVVATNALGNNFSDPVDVDVVYIVQPHTPENVTVGVLEDEDGPFLRVSWEPPRKADTRSGWITLIYELRVKLEEAEEWEEHRAGQQKMFNNFSLHSGGVYMVQVRCKPDHGFWSEWSTASYVKVPDYIPRE		Q9DE08			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Prokaryotic expression vector pMON3401 encoding full size A(-1) chicken leptin (AF012727) was prepared by PCR of previously described cDNA. Escherichia coli cells transformed with this vector overexpressed large amounts of chicken leptin upon induction with nalidixic acid.

Both fractions showed a single band of the expected molecular mass of 16 kDa and were composed of over 950f monomeric protein. The biological activity of both fractions, resulting from proper renaturation, was further evidenced by their ability to stimulate proliferation of leptin-sensitive BAF/3 cells transfected with a long form of human leptin-receptor construct and by lowering the food intake of starved chicken following intravenous or intraperitoneal injections.	1998 Dec	Raver N,Taouis M,Dridi S,Derouet M,Simon J,Robinzon B,Djiane J,Gertler A	Protein expression and purification. 14(3) 403-8	Leptin	MAVPCQIFQDDTKTLIKTIVTRINDISHTSVSAKQRVTGLDFIPGLHPILSLSKMDQTLAVYQQVLTSLPSQNVLQIANDLENLRDLLHLLAFSKSCSLPQTSGLQKPESLDGVLEASLYSTEVVALSRLQGSLQDILQQLDISPEC		O42164			9	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10809722	Biochemical characterization of the catalytic domain of human matrix metalloproteinase 19. Evidence for a role as a potent basement membrane degrading enzyme.	We have recently cloned MMP-19, a novel matrix metalloproteinase, which, due to unique structural features, was proposed to represent the first member of a new MMP subfamily (Pendás, A. M., Knäuper, V. , Puente, X. S., Llano, E., Mattei, M. G., Apte, S., Murphy, G., and López-Otin, C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 4281-4286). A recombinant COOH-terminal deletion mutant of MMP-19 (proDelta(260-508)MMP-19), comprising the propeptide and the catalytic domain, was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified. Interestingly, we found that proDelta(260-508)MMP-19 has the tendency to autoactivate, whereby the Lys(97)-Tyr(98) peptide bond is hydrolyzed, resulting in free catalytic domain. Mutation of two residues (Glu(88) --&gt; Pro and Pro(90) --&gt; Val) within the propeptide latency motif did not prevent autoactivation but the autolysis rate was somewhat reduced. Analysis of the substrate specificity revealed that the catalytic domain of MMP-19 was able to hydrolyze the general MMP substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH(2) and, with higher efficiency, the stromelysin substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH(2). Kinetic analysis of the interactions of the catalytic domain of MMP-19 with the natural MMP inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), showed strong inhibition using TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4, while TIMP-1 was less efficient. We also demonstrated that synthetic hydroxamic acid-based compounds efficiently inhibited the enzyme. The catalytic domain of MMP-19 was able to hydrolyze the basement membrane components type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen, as well as the large tenascin-C isoform, fibronectin, and type I gelatin in vitro, suggesting that MMP-19 is a potent proteinase capable of hydrolyzing a broad range of extracellular matrix components. Neither the catalytic domain nor the full-length MMP-19 was able to degrade triple-helical collagen. Finally, and in contrast to studies with other MMPs, MMP-19 catalytic domain was not able to activate any of the latent MMPs tested in vitro.	2000 May	Stracke J O,Hutton M,Stewart M,Pendás A M,Smith B,López-Otin C,Murphy G,Knäuper V	The Journal of biological chemistry. 275(20) 14809-16	Matrix metalloprotease 19	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPSSRSADYLSQYGYLQKPLEGSNNFKPEDITEALRAFQEASELPVSGQLDDATRARMRQPRCGLEDPFNQKTLKYLLLGRWRKKHLTFRILNLPSTLPPHTARAALRQAFQDWSNVAPLTFQEVQAGAADIRLSFHGRQSSYCSNTFDGPGRVLAHADIPELGSVHFDEDEFWTEGTYRGVNLRIIAAHEVGHALGLGHSRYSQALMAPVYEGYRPHFKLHPDDVAGIQALYGKKS	Two sequence mutants also produced:E88P/P90V:MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPSSRSAD YLSQYGYLQK PLEGSNNFKP  50EDITEALRAF QEASELPVSG QLDDATRARM RQPRCGLPDV FNQKTLKYLL 100LGRWRKKHLT FRILNLPSTL PPHTARAALR QAFQDWSNVA PLTFQEVQAG 150AADIRLSFHG RQSSYCSNTF DGPGRVLAHA DIPELGSVHF DEDEFWTEGT 200YRGVNLRIIA AHEVGHALGL GHSRYSQALM APVYEGYRPH FKLHPDDVAG 250IQALYGKKSNumber of amino acids: 268Molecular weight: 30120.6Theoretical pI: 6.98C166SMRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPSSRSAD YLSQYGYLQK PLEGSNNFKP  50EDITEALRAF QEASELPVSG QLDDATRARM RQPRCGLEDP FNQKTLKYLL 100LGRWRKKHLT FRILNLPSTL PPHTARAALR QAFQDWSNVA PLTFQEVQAG 150AADIRLSFHG RQSSYCCNTF DGPGRVLAHA DIPELGSVHF DEDEFWTEGT 200YRGVNLRIIA AHEVGHALGL GHSRYSQALM APVYEGYRPH FKLHPDDVAG 250IQALYGKKSNumber of amino acids: 268Molecular weight: 30166.7Theoretical pI: 6.76,N-terminal hexahis + pro seq				7.6	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9020145	Identification and characterization of a novel human matrix metalloproteinase with unique structural characteristics, chromosomal location, and tissue distribution.	We have cloned a novel member of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family of proteins from a human liver cDNA library. The isolated cDNA contains an open reading frame coding for a polypeptide of 508 amino acids, which has been tentatively called MMP-19. This protein exhibits the domain structure characteristic of previously described MMPs, including a signal sequence, a prodomain with the cysteine residue essential for maintaining the latency of these enzymes, an activation locus with the zinc-binding site, and a COOH-terminal fragment with sequence similarity to hemopexin. However, it lacks a series of structural features distinctive of the diverse MMP subclasses, including the Asp, Tyr, and Gly residues located close to the zinc-binding site in collagenases, the fibronectin-like domain of gelatinases, the transmembrane domain of membrane-type (MT) MMPs, and the furin-activation sequence common to stromelysin-3 and MT-MMPs. In addition, the 9-residue insertion rich in hydrophobic amino acids present at the hinge region in stromelysins is replaced in MMP-19 by a longer insertion very rich in acidic residues. On the basis of these structural characteristics, we propose that MMP-19 does not belong to any of the previously defined MMP-subclasses and may represent the first member of a new MMP subfamily. Chromosomal location of the MMP-19 gene revealed that it maps to chromosome 12q14, which is also a unique location for any MMPs mapped to date. The cDNA encoding a full-length MMP-19 was expressed in Escherichia coli, and after purification and refolding, the recombinant protein was able to degrade synthetic substrates for MMPs. MMP-19 proteolytic activity was abolished by TIMP-2 and EDTA, thus providing additional evidence that the isolated cDNA codes for an authentic MMP. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNAs isolated from a variety of human tissues revealed that MMP-19 is mainly expressed in placenta, lung, pancreas, ovary, spleen, and intestine, suggesting that it may play a specialized role in these tissues.	1997 Feb	Pendás A M,Knäuper V,Puente X S,Llano E,Mattei M G,Apte S,Murphy G,López-Otín C	The Journal of biological chemistry. 272(7) 4281-6	Matrix metalloprotease 19	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDRTGSDLDICSWYMNCQQLWLGFLLPMTVSGRVLGLAEVAPVDYLSQYGYLQKPLEGSNNFKPEDITEALRAFQEASELPVSGQLDDATRARMRQPRCGLEDPFNQKTLKYLLLGRWRKKHLTFRILNLPSTLPPHTARAALRQAFQDWSNVAPLTFQEVQAGAADIRLSFHGRQSSYCSNTFDGPGRVLAHADIPELGSVHFDEDEFWTEGTYRGVNLRIIAAHEVGHALGLGHSRYSQALMAPVYEGYRPHFKLHPDDVAGIQALYGKKSPVIRDEEEEETELPTVPPVPTEPSPMPDPCSSELDAMMLGPRGKTYAFKGDYVWTVSDSGPGPLFRVSALWEGLPGNLDAAVYSPRTQWIHFFKGDKVWRYINFKMSPGFPKKLNRVEPNLDAALYWPLNQKVFLFKGSGYWQWDELARTDFSSYPKPIKGLFTGVPNQPSAAMSWQDGRVYFFKGKVYWRLNQQLRVEKGYPRNISHNWMHCRPRTIDTTPSGGNTTPSGTGITLDTTLSATETTFEY	N-terminal hexahis + pro seq				8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10878489	Production of enzymatically and immunologically active Der f 1 in Escherichia coli.	Der f 1 is a major house dust mite allergen belonging to the cysteine protease family. Because of the great demand for clinical and research use of this allergen, much effort to establish an efficient method of preparing purified Der f 1 has been made. We constructed an isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible expression plasmid to produce the pro-form of Der f 1 in Escherichia coli. The recombinant product was accumulated as insoluble inclusion bodies in cells. The solubilized inclusion bodies were found to be successfully renatured by two-step gel filtration chromatography. About 70 mg of pro Der f 1 were properly refolded by this method from 1 liter of culture. Acid treatment of the renatured pro Der f 1 resulted in the autocatalytic removal of the pro-sequence. The obtained mature form of Der f 1 bound IgE in patient sera and induced the release of histamine from peripheral blood leukocytes equally to native Der f 1. Furthermore, mature Der f 1 obtained by this method had identical protease activity with native Der f 1. We also discussed the contribution of the pro-sequence and the sugar chain of Der f 1 to its antigenic and enzymatic activity. This is the first report to produce an active mature form of recombinant Der f 1 in E. coli.	2000 Jun	Takahashi K,Takai T,Yasuhara T,Yuuki T,Ohtake Y,Yokota T,Okumura Y	International archives of allergy and immunology. 122(2) 108-14	Der f 1	MRPASIKTFEEFKKAFNKNYATVEEEEVARKNFLESLKYVEANKGAINHLSDLSLDEFKNRYLMSAEAFEQLKTQFDLNAETSACRINSVNVPSELDLRSLRTVTPIRMQGGCGSCWAFSGVAATESAYLAYRNTSLDLSEQELVDCASQHGCHGDTIPRGIEYIQQNGVVEERSYPYVAREQRCRRPNSQHYGISNYCQIYPPDVKQIREALTQTHTAIAVIIGIKDLRAFQHYDGRTIIQHDNGYQPNYHAVNIVGYGSTQGDDYWIVRNSWDTTWGDSGYGYFQAGNNLMMIEQYPYVVIM	pro sequence	P16311			7.6	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8408015	The dihydrofolate reductase domain of Plasmodium falciparum thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase. Gene synthesis, expression, and anti-folate-resistant mutants.	A 693-base pair gene coding for the 27,132-dalton dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) domain of the thymidylate synthase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR) bifunctional protein of Plasmodium falciparum was designed to have Escherichia coli codon preference and multiple unique restriction sites and was chemically synthesized. The gene was overexpressed (&gt; 500tal cellular protein) in E. coli as insoluble inclusion bodies which could be unfolded and refolded to recover soluble enzyme activity. The refolded DHFR was purified by methotrexate-Sepharose affinity chromatography to give the homogeneous enzyme. Active site titration with methotrexate revealed that the purified protein was fully active. The purified DHFR migrates as a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with apparent mass of approximately 30 kDa, and gel filtration showed that the protein is a monomer. The yield of purified enzyme was about 5-6 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Kinetic properties of the purified recombinant DHFR were similar to those reported for wild type bifunctional TS-DHFR. Cassette mutagenesis of the synthetic gene was performed to give the S108N and the N51I + S108N mutants which provided DHFRs analogous to pyrimethamine-resistant mutants found in nature.	1993 Oct	Sirawaraporn W,Prapunwattana P,Sirawaraporn R,Yuthavong Y,Santi D V	The Journal of biological chemistry. 268(29) 21637-44	Dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase	MMEQVCDVFDIYAICACCKVESKNEGKKNEVFNNYTFRGLGNKGVLPWKCXSLDMKYFXAVTTYVNESKYEKLKYKRCKYLNKETVDNVNDMPNSKKLQNVVVMGRTXWESIPKKFKPLSNRINVILSRTLKKEDFDEDVYIINKVEDLIVLLGKLNYYKCFIIGGSVVYQEFLEKKLIKKIYFTRINSTYECDVFFPEINENEYQIISVSDVYTSNNTTLDFIIYKKTNNKM	UniProt for Dihydrofolate reductase domain only: Q9GN27_PLAFA	P13922		Dihydrofolate reductase domain	7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7764745	High-level expression of a biologically active human interleukin-6 mutein.	We have constructed two different muteins of interleukin-6 (IL-6) which were expressed in Escherichia coli. Both muteins lack the first 22 N-terminal amino acids of native IL-6 and lack one or the other of the two naturally occurring pairs of cysteines at either position 45 and 51 or position 74 and 84 of IL-6. We found that there was a dramatic increase in the level of IL-6 produced from each mutein clone, compared to the level produced by the wild-type IL-6 clone. We also observed that the yield of soluble and properly refolded mutein IL-6 was highest when the cysteines at position 74 and 84 were left intact. The mutein IL-6 with cysteines at position 74 and 84 was as active as wild-type IL-6 and a lower concentration of the mutein IL-6 was required to reach maximal activity, compared to wild-type IL-6. The mutein IL-6 with cysteines at position 45 and 51 had a much reduced biological activity.	1994 Apr	Skelly S M,Tackney C,Hicklin D,Tamkins T,Goldstein N,Waksal H,Dagan S	Journal of biotechnology. 34(1) 79-86	Interleukin-6	SERIDKQIRYILDGISALRKETSNKSNMSESSKEALAENNLNLPKMAEKDGSFQSGFNEETSLVKIITGLLEFEVYLEYLQNRFESSEEQARAVQMSTKVLIQFLQKKAKNLDAITTPDPTTNASLLTKLQAQNQWLQDMTTHLIL	Other truncated versions of IL6 expressed and refolded:Delta 22Cys1,2SERIDKQI RYILDGISAL RKETCNKSNM CESSKEALAE NNLNLPKMAE KDGSFQSGFN EETSLVKIIT GLLEFEVYLE YLQNRFESSE EQARAVQMST KVLIQFLQKK AKNLDAITTP DPTTNASLLT KLQAQNQWLQ DMTTHLILNumber of amino acids: 146Molecular weight: 16617.9Theoretical pI: 5.27Delta 22Cys3,4SERIDKQI RYILDGISAL RKETSNKSNM SESSKEALAE NNLNLPKMAE KDGCFQSGFN EETCLVKIIT GLLEFEVYLE YLQNRFESSE EQARAVQMST KVLIQFLQKK AKNLDAITTP DPTTNASLLT KLQAQNQWLQ DMTTHLILNumber of amino acids: 146Molecular weight: 16617.9Theoretical pI: 5.27	P05231		aa.23-168 (Delta22)	8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16232493	Cloning and expression of chitin deacetylase gene from a Deuteromycete, Colletotrichum lindemuthianum.	The chitin deacetylase gene was cloned from cDNA of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum ATCC 56676, and the open reading frame consisted of a possible prepro-sequence of 27 amino acids at the N-terminus and a mature chitin deacetylase. The deduced amino acid sequence of the mature enzyme revealed 26 0dentity and 46imilarity with a chitin deacetylase from Mucor rouxii. The molecular mass of the protein estimated from the amino acid sequence data was 24.3 kDa, which was in good agreement with the MALDI-TOF MS analysis data of the purified protein (24.17-24.36 kDa). The gene product was overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells as a fusion protein with six histidine residues at its C-terminus. The fusion protein formed inclusion bodies, but chitin deacetylase activity was restored from the inclusion bodies by a simple renaturation step with 8 M urea treatment. The recombinant enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration steps, and had a final specific activity of 4.22 units mg(-1) of protein. Trypsin digestion of the recombinant enzyme resulted in 2.1-fold increase in activity, suggesting that the removal of the prepro-domain from the recombinant enzyme resulted in an increase in its activity.	1999 	Tokuyasu K,Ohnishi-Kameyama M,Hayashi K,Mori Y	Journal of bioscience and bioengineering. 87(4) 418-23	Chitin deacetylase	MDFSTLLGAAATAALAGSTNASPLARRQVPVGTPILQCTQPGLVALTYDDGPFTFTPQLLDILKQNDVRATFFVNGNNWANIEAGSNPDTIRRMRADGHLVGSHTYAHPDLNTLSSADRISQMRHVEEATRRIDGFAPKYMRAPYLSCDAGCQGDLGGLGYHIIDTNLDTKDYENNKPETTHLSAEKFNNELSADVGANSYIVLSHDVHEQTVVSLTQKLIDTLKSKGYRAVTVGECLGDAPENWYKAHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q6DWK3			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

8817663	A 3-dimensional model for the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs); supporting evidence using the structural determinants of the IGF binding site on IGFBP-3.	It is generally accepted but not established that the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding site on the IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) is in the N-terminal region. However, other workers have reported C-terminal fragments with IGF binding determinants. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that both the N- and C-terminal regions of IGFBPs are involved in binding. Using a protein A gene fusion system, a cDNA encoding residues 1-147 (N147) was cloned into the plasmid pRIT2T and expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein. Since an Asn N-terminal to the gly of IGFBP-3 had been engineered into the cDNA construct, protein A was cleaved from N147 by hydroxylamine. Purified N147 was refolded in a DTT/cystamine redox system at pH 8.4 under nitrogen atmosphere. Both ligand binding Westerns and solution binding assays demonstrated that the recombinant derived N147 bound IGFs. The 147 and 176 residue N-terminal fragments, including a C-terminal fragment (residues 151-263) of IGFBP-3 were also expressed in pichia (yeast) as glycosylated proteins. Solution binding assays showed that they all bound labelled IGF-1. In conclusion, IGFBP-3 contains at least two binding determinants, one on the N- and one on the C-terminal domain. There may also be a possible contribution from the intermediate (I) domain. Our molecular genetic approach to mapping the binding region for IGFs on IGFBP-3 can now be tested on the other mutants we have prepared. Subsequently, site directed mutagenesis can be used to pinpoint key functional residues.	1995 	Spencer E M,Chan K	Progress in growth factor research. 6(2-4) 209-14	Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3	GASSGGLGPVVRCEPCDARALAQCAPPPAVCAELVREPGCGCCLTCALSEGQPCGIYTERCGSGLRCQPSPDEARPLQALLDGRGLCVNASAVSRLRAYLLPAPPAPGNASESEEDRSAGSVESPSVSSTHRVSDPKFHPLHSKIII	N-terminal Protein A	P17936		N terminal portion aa.1-147	8.4	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9480849	Gene 1, one of the dna genes of bacteriophage phi 29, represses other dna genes through binding to mRNA.	The dna genes, essential for protein priming DNA replication of bacteriophage phi 29, are transcribed as a long polycistronic mRNA. In the previous study, gene 1 product (gp1) was shown to repress the expression of the upstream dna genes for DNA polymerase and primer protein. To investigate the details of the repression by gp1, we have examined the amount and integrity of polycistronic mRNA encoding DNA polymerase and primer protein by agarose gel electrophoresis and nuclease S1 protection assay. As a result, the amount, size, and integrity of the polycistronic mRNA were not influenced by the presence of gene 1. Furthermore, the RNA binding ability of gp1 was demonstrated by in vitro system using histidine-tagged gp1. These results strongly suggested that translation of the dna genes was affected by gp1 through binding to mRNA. Other possible mechanisms of gene regulation by gp1 were discussed.	1998 Feb	Takeuchi A,Makino O,Hirokawa H	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 243(2) 566-71	Early protein GP1	MGKIFDQEKRLEGTWKNSKWGNQGIIAPVDGDLKMIDLELEKKMTKLEHENKLMKNALYELSRMENNDYATWVIKVLFGGAPHGAKHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P03679			7.6	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2023247	Functional role of the distal valine (E11) residue of alpha subunits in human haemoglobin.	We have expressed human alpha-globin to a high level in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein, purified it and removed the N-terminal leader sequence by site-specific proteolysis with blood coagulation factor Xa. The apo globin has been refolded and reconstituted with haem and native beta-globin to form fully functional haemoglobin (Hb) with properties identical to those of native human Hb. By site-directed mutagenesis we have altered the distal residues of the alpha subunits and compared the functional properties of these mutant proteins. The rates of various ligands binding to these proteins in the R-state have been reported by Mathews et al. Here, we present the oxygen equilibrium curves of three E11 alpha mutants and the crystal structures of two of these mutants in the deoxy form. Replacing the distal valine residue of alpha-globin with alanine, leucine or isoleucine has no effect on the oxygen affinity of the protein in either quaternary state, in contrast to the equivalent mutations of beta subunits. The crystal structure of the valine E11 alpha----isoleucine mutant shows that the larger E11 residue excludes water from the haem pocket, but causes no significant movement of other amino acid residues. We conclude that the distal valine residue of alpha-globin does not control the oxygen affinity of the protein by sterically hindering ligand binding.	1991 Apr	Tame J,Shih D T,Pagnier J,Fermi G,Nagai K	Journal of molecular biology. 218(4) 761-7	Haemoglobin alpha subunit	VLSPADKTNVKAAWGKVGAHAGEYGAEALERMFLSFPTTKTYFPHFDLSHGSAQVKGHGKKVADALTNAVAHVDDMPNALSALSDLHAHKLRVDPVNFKLLSHCLLVTLAAHLPAEFTPAVHASLDKFLASVSTVLTSKYR	N-terminus CII and beta-globin residues 1-18	P69905			5.7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
9220030	Selective modification at the N-terminal region of human growth hormone that shows antagonistic activity.	A new analogue of recombinant human growth hormone (hGH), hGH des(1-6,14) was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded and purified to homogeneity. The mutation decreased the hormone&#39;s ability to bind lactogenic and somatogenic receptors through its site 1, and almost completely abolished its ability to bind these receptors through site 2, as evidenced by both binding and gel-filtration experiments. More specifically, the binding to prolactin receptors (PRLRs) from various species or their soluble recombinant extracellular domains (ECDs) was decreased 1.5-4-fold, whereas the binding to hGH receptor (hGHR) was decreased 10-85-fold. These changes caused an almost total loss of hormone agonistic activity in several in vitro bioassays and subsequently, the hGH des(1-6,14) analogue acquired antagonistic properties. This antagonistic activity was dependent upon modification of site 1. In those cases in which the binding was reduced only slightly, e.g. binding to rabbit PRLRs, hGH des(1-6,14) acted as a strong antagonist, whereas in others in which the binding of site 1 was reduced to a higher degree, such as other PRLRs and, in particular, hGHR, the antagonistic activity was correspondingly weaker. Circular dichroism spectra of the analogue suggested that these changes do not result from a decrease in overall alpha-helix content, but rather from minor local structural modifications at the N-terminus.	1997 Jun	Tchelet A,Vogel T,Helman D,Guy R,Neospouolus C,Goffin V,Djiane J,Gertler A	Molecular and cellular endocrinology. 130(1-2) 141-52	Growth Hormone	MATGSRTSLLLAFGLLCLPWLQEGSAFPTIPLSRLFDNAMLRAHRLHQLAFDTYQEFEEAYIPKEQKYSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNREETQQKSNLELLRISLLLIQSWLEPVQFLRSVFANSLVYGASDSNVYDLLKDLEEGIQTLMGRLEDGSPRTGQIFKQTYSKFDTNSHNDDALLKNYGLLYCFRKDMDKVETFLRIVQCRSVEGSCGF		P01241			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
9882568	Recombinant human cytomegalovirus protease with a C-terminal (His)6 extension: purification, autocatalytic release of the mature enzyme, and biochemical characterization.	Human cytomegalovirus protease (CMV PR) is a target for the development of antiviral therapeutics. To obtain large amounts of native protease, a 268-amino-acid polypeptide with a hexahistidinyl tag at the C terminus was expressed in Escherichia coli. The first 262 amino acids of the recombinant protein were identical to the amino acid sequence of native CMV PR, except for mutations introduced at the internal cleavage site to eliminate autoproteolysis at that site. The hexahistidinyl tag was placed downstream of amino acid 262 of the native CMV PR sequence. In this design, the Ala-Ser bond at amino acids 256-257 constitutes a site naturally cleaved by the protease during capsid maturation. The 268-amino-acid polypeptide with the (His)6 tag was expressed at high levels in E. coli as inclusion bodies. After solubilization of the inclusion bodies, the protease was purified to homogeneity by a single step using Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The protease was refolded to an active enzyme using dialysis which leads to effective autocleavage of the Ala-Ser bond at amino acids 256-257 to remove 12 amino acids including the (His)6 tag from the C terminus of the protein. This strategy yielded large amounts of highly purified CMV PR with the native N terminus and C terminus. Approximately 40 mg of purified CMV PR was obtained per liter of cell culture using this strategy. The enzymatic activity of CMV PR purified from inclusion bodies and refolded to an active enzyme was similar to the enzymatic activity of CMV PR expressed as a soluble protein in E. coli. In addition, the refolded CMV PR could be crystallized for X-ray diffraction.	1998 Dec	Tomasselli A G,Paddock D J,Curry K A,Garlick R L,Leone J W,Lull J M,Mutchler V T,Baker C A,Cavey G S,Mathews W R,Shelly J A,Finzel B C,Baldwin E T,Wells P A,Tomich C S	Protein expression and purification. 14(3) 343-52	Cytomegalovirus protease	MTMDEQQSQAVAPVYVGGFLARYDQSPDEAELLLPRDVVEHWLHAQGQGQPSLSVALPLNINHDDTAVVGHVAAMQSVRDGLFCLGCVTSPRFLEIVRRASEKSELVSRGPVSPLQPDKVVEFLSGSYAGLSLSSRRCDDVEAATSLSGSETTPFKHVALCSVGRRRGTLAVYGRDPEWVTQRFPDLTAADRDGLRAQWQRCGSTAVDASGDPFRSDSYGLLGNSVDALYIRERLPKLRYDKQLVGVTERESYVKASVSPEAHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P16753			7.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2182116	Substrate analogue inhibition and active site titration of purified recombinant HIV-1 protease.	The aspartyl protease of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) has been expressed in Escherichia coli at high levels, resulting in the formation of inclusion bodies which contain denatured insoluble aggregates of the protease. After solubilization of these inclusion bodies in guanidinium chloride, the protease was purified to apparent homogeneity by a single-step reverse-phase HPLC procedure. The purified, but inactive, protein was denatured in 8 M urea and refolded to produce the active protease. Enzyme activity was demonstrated against the substrate H-Val-Ser-Gln-Asn-Tyr-Pro-Ile-Val-OH, modeled after the cleavage region between residues 128 and 135 in the HIV gag polyprotein. With this substrate, a Vmax of 1.3 +/- 0.2 mumol/(min.mg) and KM of 2.0 +/- 0.3 mM were determined at pH 5.5. Pepstatin (Iva-Val-Val-Sta-Ala-Sta-OH) and substrate analogues with the Tyr-Pro residues substituted by Sta, by Phe psi [CH2N]Pro, and by Leu psi [CH(OH)CH2]Val inhibited the protease with KI values of 360 nM, 3690 nM, 3520 nM, and less than 10 nM, respectively. All were competitive inhibitors, and the tightest binding compound provided an active site titrant for the quantitative determination of enzymatically active HIV-1 protease.	1990 Jan	Tomasselli A G,Olsen M K,Hui J O,Staples D J,Sawyer T K,Heinrikson R L,Tomich C S	Biochemistry. 29(1) 264-9	HIV protease	PQITLWQRPLVTIKIGGQLKEALLDTGADDTVLEEMSLPGRWKPKMIGGIGGFIKVRQYDQILIEICGHKAIGTVLVGPTPVNIIGRNLLTQIGCTLNFPISPIETVPVKLKPGMDGPKVKQW		P03366			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10215869	Identification of novel sites in the ovine growth hormone receptor involved in binding hormone and conferring species specificity.	Using site-directed mutagenesis we mutated the extracellular domain of the ovine growth hormone receptor (oGHR) to the corresponding amino acids in the rat GHR at two different sites: site A is between Thr28 and Leu34 and represents a major immunogenic epitope, while site B is between Ser121 and Asp124 and is involved in the interaction of the human GHR with growth hormone (GH). Native and mutant receptors were bacterially expressed and refolded, and then RIA and GH-binding assays were carried out on the purified recombinant proteins. Mutations at the N-terminal site A of oGHR led to greatly reduced binding to bovine GH and, in addition, to significant loss of recognition by a polyclonal antiserum to bovine GHR which recognizes site A as a major epitope. The crystal structure of human GH bound to human GHR did not resolve this extreme N-terminal region of the receptor but our data indicate that the N-terminal loop undertakes a 180 degrees turn bringing it into close proximity to the hormone-binding domain in a fashion analogous to the prolactin receptor. A fourfold decrease in affinity for binding bovine GH was also observed after mutation of site B. However, this change from the ovine sequence to the equivalent sequence in the rat GHR at site B caused a 2.4-fold increase in the affinity of binding to rat GH. Taken together, the changes in binding affinity of the site-B mutant for rat and bovine GH demonstrate that this site is involved in conferring species specificity for binding GH.	1999 Apr	Allan G J,Shand J H,Beattie J,Flint D J	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 261(2) 555-62	Growth Hormone Receptor	FSGSEATPAFFVRASQSLQILYPGLETNSSGNLKFTKCRSPELETFSCHWTDGANHSLQSPGSVQMFYIRRDIQEWKECPDYVSAGENSCYFNSSYTSVWTPYCIKLTSNGGIVDHKCFSVEDIVQPDPPVGLNWTLLNISLTEIHADILVKWEPPPNTDVKMGWIILEYELHYKELNETQWKMMDPLLVTSVPMYSLRLDKEYEVRVRTRQRNTEKYGKFSEVLLITFPQMNPSACEEDFQFPWFLIIIFGILGLTVTLFLLIFSKQQRIKMLILPPVPVPKIKGIDPDLLKEGKLEEVNTILAIHDNYKHEFYNDDSWVEFIELDIDDPDEKTEGSDTDRLLSNDHEKSLSIFGAKDDDSGRTSCYEPDILETDFHVSDMCDGTSEVAQPQRLKGEADILCLDQKNQNNSPSNDAAPASQQPSVILVEENKPRPLPIGGTESTHQAVHTQLSNPSSLANIDFYAQVSDITPAGNVVLSPGQKNKTGNPQCDTHPEVVTPSQADFIVDSAYFCEVDAKKYIALAPDVEAESHIEPSFNQEDIYITTESLTTTAGRSGTAENVPSSEIPVPDYTSIHIVQSPQGLVLNATALPLPDKEFLSSCGYVSTDQLNKIMP	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q28575			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15975930	The proximal carboxyl-terminal domains of ADAMTS13 determine substrate specificity and are all required for cleavage of von Willebrand factor.	ADAMTS13 limits platelet-rich thrombosis by cleaving von Willebrand factor at the Tyr(1605)-Met(1606) bond. Previous studies showed that ADAMTS13 truncated after spacer domain remains proteolytically active or hyperactive. However, the relative contribution of each domain within the proximal carboxyl terminus of ADAMTS13 in substrate recognition and specificity is not known. We showed that a metalloprotease domain alone was unable to cleave the Tyr-Met bond of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-VWF73-H substrate in 3 h, but it did cleave the substrate at a site other than the Tyr-Met bond after 16-24 h of incubation. Remarkably, the addition of even one or several proximal carboxyl-terminal domains of ADAMTS13 restored substrate specificity. Full proteolytic activity, however, was not achieved until all of the proximal carboxyl-terminal domains were added. The addition of TSP1 2-8 repeats and two CUB domains did not further increase proteolytic activity. Furthermore, ADAMTS13 truncated after the spacer domain with or without metalloprotease domain bound GST-VWF73-H with a K(d) of approximately 7.0 or 13 nm, comparable with full-length ADAMTS13 (K(d) = 4.6 nm). Metalloprotease domain did not bind GST-VWF73-H detectably, but the disintegrin domain, first TSP1 repeat, Cys-rich domain, and spacer domain bound GST-VWF73-H with K(d) values of 489, 136, 121, and 108 nm, respectively. These proximal carboxyl-terminal domains dose-dependently inhibited cleavage of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRETS)-VWF73 by full-length ADAMTS13 and ADAMTS13 truncated after the spacer domain. These data demonstrated that the proximal carboxyl-terminal domains of ADAMTS13 determine substrate specificity and are all required for recognition and cleavage of von Willebrand factor between amino acid residues Asp(1595) and Arg(1668).	2005 Aug	Ai Jihui,Smith Paula,Wang Shuwei,Zhang Ping,Zheng X Long	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(33) 29428-34	ADAMTS13	MHHHHHHGKPIPNPLLGLDSTENLTFQIDPFTMMHQRHPRARCPPLCVAGILACGFLLGCWGPSHFQQSCLQALEPQAVSSYLSPGAPLKGRPPSPGFQRQRQRQRRAAGGILHLELLVAVGPDVFQAHQEDTERYVLTNLNIGAELLRDPSLGAQFRVHLVKMVILTEPEGAPNITANLTSSLLSVCGWSQTINPEDDTDPGHADLVLYITRFDLELPDGNRQVRGVTQLGGACSPTWSCLITEDTGFDLGVTIAHEIGHSFGLEHDGAPGSGCGPSGHVMASDGAAPRAGLAWSPCSRRQLLSLLSANEQCRVAFGPKAVACTFAREHLDMCQALSCHTDPLDQSSCSRLLVPLLDGTECGVEKWCSKGRCRSLVELTPIAAVHGRWSSWGPRSPCSRSCGGGVVTRRRQCNNPRPAFGGRACVGADLQAEMCNTQACEKTQLEFMSQQCARTDGQPLRSSPGGASFYHWGAAVPHSQGDALCRHMCRAIGESFIMKRGDSFLDGTRCMPSGPREDGTLSLCVSGSCRTFGCDGRMDSQQVWDRCQVCGGDNSTCSPRKGSFTAGRAREYVTFLTVTPNLTSVYIANHRPLFTHLAVRIGGRYVVAGKMSISPNTTYPSLLEDGRVEYRVALTEDRLPRLEEIRIWGPLQEDADIQVYRRYGEEYGNLTRPDITFTYFQPKPRQAWVWAAVRGPCSVSCGAGLRWVNYSCLDQARKELVETVQCQGSQQPPAWPEACVLEPCPPYWAVGDFGPCSASCGGGLRERPVRCVEAQGSLLKTLPPARCRAGAQQPAVALETCNPQPCPARWEVSEPSSCTSAGGAGLALENETCVPGADGLEAPVTEGPGSVDEKLPAPEPCVGMSCPPGWGHLDATSAGEKAPSPWGSIRTGAQAAHVWTPAAGSCSVSCGRGLMELRFLCMDSALRVPVQEELCGLASKPGSRREVCQAVPCPARWQYKLAACSVSCGRGVVRRILYCARAHGEDDGEEILLDTQCQGLPRPEPQEACSLEPCPPRWKVMSLGPCSASCGLGTARRSVACVQLDQGQDVEVDEAACAALVRPEASVPCLIADCTYRWHVGTWMECSVSCGDGIQRRRDTCLGPQAQAPVPADFCQHLPKPVTVRGCWAGPCVGQGACGRQHLEPTGTIDMRGPGQADCAVAIGRPLGEVVTLRVLESSLNCSAGDMLLLWGRLTWRKMCRKLLDMTFSSKTNTLVVRQRCGRPGGGVLLRYGSQLAPETFYRECDMQLFGPWGEIVSPSLSPATSNAGGCRLFINVAPHARIAIHALATNMGAGTEGANASYILIRDTHSLRTTAFHGQQVLYWESESSQAEMEFSEGFLKAQASLRGQYWTLQSWVPEMQDPQSWKGKEGT	Carboxyl-terminal truncated domains of ADAMTS13 from E.coli also expressed and refolded:His-V5-Dis, encodes disintegrin domainHis-V5-TSP1, Encodes up to first tsp1 (approximately 357-407)His-V5-CysR, encodes up to spacerHis-V5-Spa, encodes spacervarious c-terminal truncated domains of ADAMTS13,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q76LX8			8	22	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16091591	Expression of erythropoietin receptor-like molecule in Xenopus laevis and erythrocytopenia upon administration of its recombinant soluble form.	The regulation of hematopoiesis in non-mammalian vertebrates is poorly understood. This is partly because the structures and effects of most hematopoietic regulators have not been identified. As a first step towards studies on the key mechanism of hematopoietic regulation among phyla as well as the diversity of organisms, we have focused on amphibian hematopoiesis. A cDNA sharing the highest degree of homology with mammalian erythropoietin (EPO) receptors, tentatively named xlEPOR, was cloned from a cDNA library of Xenopus laevis immature erythrocytes. The comparative identities of the deduced entire amino acid sequence to mammalian EPO receptors were quite low, although functional domains indispensable for erythropoietic activities were found in the molecule. Northern analysis revealed that xlEPOR were expressed in peripheral blood cells. In the peripheral blood of phenylhydrazine-treated adult Xenopus, immature erythrocytes expressing xlEPOR were identified by in situ hybridization and immunostaining with polyclonal antibodies to xlEPOR. To confirm the biological functions of this molecule, the extracellular domain of xlEPOR (i.e., soluble xlEPOR) was administered to adult Xenopus by consecutive intracardiac injection. The peripheral erythrocyte counts were decreased gradually; meanwhile, immature erythrocytes appeared in the circulation, demonstrating that xlEPOR plays a significant physiological role in erythropoiesis in Xenopus laevis.	2005 Aug	Aizawa Youichi,Nogawa Nami,Kosaka Nobuyoshi,Maeda Yasutaka,Watanabe Takafumi,Miyazaki Hiroshi,Kato Takashi	Journal of biochemistry. 138(2) 167-75	Erythropoietin Receptor	EDPTMTPEFLRHISEKIPEEYQNPHCFTRDLNDFICFWEGERRKNASFSYSEDDQIKWCQLRTEVASNNTWWYICEFPVTDVVLFAGITISAYPCHKCQTAREIYINELVLLNPPLNVTVKEKQDPRGLLISWKPPHFQKNHDINNEIKYQVNYSTPGADMQTVEVEAGNTEIFLTDIVPAAYTVTVRCKADGVSYNGYWSDWTAPITIATIIDLRLLLLLSIAIFVALIAGVGVYIFMRHGMYLKHKVWPQVPTPENNFQGLFTTHKGNFKLWLGQADAYLLWISRHVFQEDPSSTLEVLSELPPAALPQSFNPNPLKDSYVVLDENRMPCSLEWLEAQRHKTVIVGAESMDSRLQTVNKDVVLEDTSKGQIAVKANNRVHSLEGDGSQGEAFREDEYVEAPRMEHERHRVSRENSVSSDGKQSIPSSFEYTELQTCEGLLSPKPRPVPPRMPLKYAYLDMSSSGEHSPPPSPNFYQNSPITNFLAPIYSQS	N-terminal GST	Q4W815			7.5	37	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10336876	Renaturation of Escherichia coli-derived recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor.	Recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhM-CSF), a homodimeric, disulfide bonded protein, was expressed in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies. Reduced and denatured rhM-CSF monomers were refolded in the presence of a thiol mixture (reduced and oxidized glutathione) and a low concentration of denaturing agent (urea or guanidinium chloride). Refolding was monitored by nonreducing gel electrophoresis and recovery of bioactivity. The effects of denaturant type and concentration, protein concentration, concentration of thiol/disulfide reagents, temperature, and presence of impurities on the kinetics of rhM-CSF renaturation were investigated. Low denaturant concentrations (&lt;0.5 M urea) and high protein concentrations (&gt;0.4 mg/ml) in the refolding mixture resulted in increased formation of aggregates, although aggregation was never significant even when refolding was carried out at room temperature. Higher protein concentration resulted in higher rates but did not lead to increased yields, due to the formation of unwanted aggregates. Experiments conducted at room temperature resulted in slightly higher rates than those conducted at 4 degrees C. Although the initial renaturation rate for solubilized inclusion body protein without purification was higher than that of the reversed-phase purified reduced denatured rhM-CSF, the final renaturation yield was much higher for the purified material. A maximum refolding yield of 95% was obtained for the purified material at the following refolding conditions: 0.5 M urea, 50 mM Tris, 1.25 mM DTT, 2 mM GSH, 2 mM GSSG, 22 degrees C, pH 8, [protein] = 0.13 mg/ml.	1999 Jun	Tran-Moseman A,Schauer N,De Bernardez Clark E	Protein expression and purification. 16(1) 181-9	Macrophage colony-stimulating factor	EEVSEYCSHMIGSGHLQSLQRLIDSQMETSCQITFEFVDQEQLKDPVCYLKKAFLLVQDIMEDTMRFRDNTPNAIAIVQLQELSLRLKSCFTKDYEEHDKACVRTFYETPLQLLEKVKNVFNETKNLLDKDWNIFSKNCNNSFAECSSQDVVTKPDCNCLYPKAIPSSDPASVSPHQPLAPSMAPVAGLTWEDSEGTEGSSLLPGEQPLHTVDPGSAKQRPPR		P09603		aa.1-223	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7765373	Production and characterization of a novel tissue-type plasminogen activator derivative in Escherichia coli.	We have created a novel thrombolytic agent by the combination of mutation with partial deletion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). We constructed Escherichia coli expression vectors for (i) native t-PA (nt-PA) and its derivatives; (ii) K1K2P, consisting of kringle 1 (K1), kringle 2 (K2), and protease (P) domains; (iii) K2P, consisting of K2 and P domains; (iv) D-nt-PA; (v) D-K1K2P; and (vi) D-K2P. The latter three are point mutants of nt-PA, K1K2P, and K2P, respectively, in which Arg275 (number corresponds to that of nt-PA) has been mutated to Asp. The production of nt-PA and its derivatives was remarkably improved by (i) removal of the 3&#39; noncoding region of nt-PA cDNA from expression vectors and (ii) expression in mutant E. coli derived from E. coli HB101, which is insensitive to heat-shock inductions. The proteins produced were precipitated as insoluble aggregates in the cells and were renatured to active forms by extraction with 8 M urea followed by dialysis against a redox buffer containing GSH and GSSG. The renaturation yield depended on the pH of the buffer and the number of disulfide bonds of the proteins (nt-PA &lt; K1K2P &lt; K2P).

9552156	Crystal structure of calcium-independent subtilisin BPN&#39; with restored thermal stability folded without the prodomain.	The three-dimensional structure of a subtilisin BPN&#39; construct that was produced and folded without its prodomain shows the tertiary structure is nearly identical to the wild-type enzyme and not a folding intermediate. The subtilisin BPN&#39; variant, Sbt70, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli without the prodomain, the 77-residue N-terminal domain that catalyzes the folding of the enzyme into its native tertiary structure. Sbt70 has the high-affinity calcium-binding loop, residues 75 to 83, deleted. Such calcium-independent forms of subtilisin BPN&#39; refold independently while retaining high levels of activity [Bryan et al., Biochemistry, 31:4937-4945, 1992]. Sbt70 has, in addition, seven stabilizing mutations, K43N, M50F, A73L, Q206V, Y217K, N218S, Q271E, and the active site serine has been replaced with alanine to prevent autolysis. The purified Sbt70 folded spontaneously without the prodomain and crystallized at room temperature. Crystals of Sbt70 belong to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell parameters a = 53.5 A, b = 60.3 A, and c = 83.4 A. Comparison of the refined structure with other high-resolution structures of subtilisin BPN&#39; establishes that the conformation of Sbt70 is essentially the same as that previously determined for other calcium-independent forms and that of other wild-type subtilisin BPN&#39; structures, all folded in the presence of the prodomain. These findings confirm the results of previous solution studies that showed subtilisin BPN&#39; can be refolded into a native conformation without the presence of the prodomain [Bryan et al., Biochemistry 31:4937-4945, 1992]. The structure analysis also provides the first descriptions of four stabilizing mutations, K43N, A73L, Q206V, and Q271E, and provides details of the interaction between the enzyme and the Ala-Leu-Ala-Leu tetrapeptide found in the active-site cleft.	1998 Apr	Almog O,Gallagher T,Tordova M,Hoskins J,Bryan P,Gilliland G L	Proteins. 31(1) 21-32	Subtilisin BPN	MRGKKVWISLLFALALIFTMAFGSTSSAQAAGKSNGEKKYIVGFKQTMSTMSAAKKKDVISEKGGKVQKQFKYVDAASATLNEKAVKELKKDPSVAYVEEDHVAHAYAQSVPYGVSQIKAPALHSQGYTGSNVKVAVIDSGIDSSHPDLKVAGGASMVPSETNPFQDNNSHGTHVAGTVAALNNSIGVLGVAPSASLYAVKVLGADGSGQYSWIINGIEWAIANNMDVINMSLGGPSGSAALKAAVDKAVASGVVVVAAAGNEGTSGSSSTVGYPGKYPSVIAVGAVDSSNQRASFSSVGPELDVMAPGVSIQSTLPGNKYGAYNGTSMASPHVAGAAALILSKHPNWTNTQVRSSLENTTTKLGDSFYYGKGLINVQAAAQ		P00782			7	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
9790947	Identification of the veratryl alcohol binding site in lignin peroxidase by site-directed mutagenesis.	Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify the veratryl alcohol binding site of lignin peroxidase. The cDNA encoding isozyme H8 was mutated at Glu146 to both an Ala and a Ser residue. The H8 polypeptide was produced by E. coli as inclusion bodies and refolded to yield active enzyme. The wild type recombinant enzyme and the mutants were purified to homogeneity and characterized by steady state kinetics. The kcat is decreased for both mutants of Glu146. The reactivity of mutants (kcat/Km) toward H2O2 were not affected. In contrast, the kcat/Km of the mutants for veratryl alcohol were decreased by at least half. The oxidation of guaiacol by these mutants were more significantly affected. These results collectively suggest that E146 plays a central role in the binding of veratryl alcohol by lignin peroxidase.	1998 Oct	Ambert-Balay K,Fuchs S M,Tien M	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 251(1) 283-6	Lignin peroxidase	MALKQLAAAVALALSIQAAQGAAVKEKRATCSNGATVGDASSCAWFDVLDDIQQNLFNGAQCGAEAHESIRLVFHDAIAISPALESQGKFGGGGADGSIILFDDIETNFHPNIGLDEIVNLQKPFIQKHGVTPGDFIAFAGAVAMSNCPGAPQMNFFTGRAPATQAAPDGLVPEPFHTVDQIISRVNDAGEFDELELVWMLSAHSVAAANDVDPTIQGLAFDSTPGVFDSQFFVETQLRGTAFPGSGGNQGEVESPLPGEMRLQSDSSIARDSRTACEWQSFVNNQSKLVSDFQFIFLALTQLGENPDAMTDCSDVIPISKPVPNNVPFSFFPAGKTMADVEQACAETPFPTLTTLPGPETSVQRIPPPGA		Q01787			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8443602	A study of intermediates involved in the folding pathway for recombinant human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF): evidence for two distinct folding pathways.	The folding pathway for a 150-amino acid recombinant form of the dimeric cytokine human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) has been studied. All 14 cysteine residues in the biologically active homodimer are involved in disulfide linkages. The structural characteristics of folding intermediates blocked with iodoacetamide reveal a rapid formation of a small amount of a non-native dimeric intermediate species followed by a slow progression via both monomeric and dimeric intermediates to the native dimer. The transition from monomer to fully folded dimer is complete within 25 h at room temperature at pH 9.0. The blocked intermediates are stable under conditions of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and thus represent various dimeric and folded monomeric species of the protein with different numbers of disulfide bridges. Peptide mapping and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed that a folded monomeric species of M-CSF contained three of the four native disulfide bridges, and this folded monomer also showed some biological activity in a cell-based assay. The results presented here strongly suggest that M-CSF can fold via two different pathways, one involving monomeric intermediates and another involving only dimeric intermediates.	1993 Feb	Wilkins J A,Cone J,Randhawa Z I,Wood D,Warren M K,Witkowska H E	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 2(2) 244-54	Macrophage colony-stimulating factor	EEVSEYCSHMIGSGHLQSLQRLIDSQMETSCQITFEFVDQEQLKDPVCYLKKAFLLVQDIMEDTMRFRDNTPNAIAIVQLQELSLRLKSCFTKDYEEHDKACVRTFYETPLQLLEKVKNVFNETKNLLDKDWNIFSKNCNNSFAECSSQDVVTK		P09603		aa.4-153	9	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
12954613	Activation mechanisms of conventional protein kinase C isoforms are determined by the ligand affinity and conformational flexibility of their C1 domains.	The regulatory domains of conventional and novel protein kinases C (PKC) have two C1 domains (C1A and C1B) that have been identified as the interaction site for diacylglycerol (DAG) and phorbol ester. It has been reported that C1A and C1B domains of individual PKC isoforms play different roles in their membrane binding and activation; however, DAG affinity of individual C1 domains has not been quantitatively determined. In this study, we measured the affinity of isolated C1A and C1B domains of two conventional PKCs, PKCalpha and PKCgamma, for soluble and membrane-incorporated DAG and phorbol ester by isothermal calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance. The C1A and C1B domains of PKCalpha have opposite affinities for DAG and phorbol ester; i.e. the C1A domain with high affinity for DAG and the C1B domain with high affinity for phorbol ester. In contrast, the C1A and C1b domains of PKCgamma have comparably high affinities for both DAG and phorbol ester. Consistent with these results, mutational studies of full-length proteins showed that the C1A domain is critical for the DAG-induced activation of PKCalpha, whereas both C1A and C1B domains are involved in the DAG-induced activation of PKCgamma. Further mutational studies in conjunction with in vitro activity assay and monolayer penetration analysis indicated that, unlike the C1A domain of PKCalpha, neither the C1A nor the C1B domain of PKCgamma is conformationally restricted. Cell studies with enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged PKCs showed that PKCalpha did not translocate to the plasma membrane in response to DAG at a basal intracellular calcium concentration due to the inaccessibility of its C1A domain, whereas PKCgamma rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane under the same conditions. These data suggest that differential activation mechanisms of PKC isoforms are determined by the DAG affinity and conformational flexibility of their C1 domains.	2003 Nov	Ananthanarayanan Bharath,Stahelin Robert V,Digman Michelle A,Cho Wonhwa	The Journal of biological chemistry. 278(47) 46886-94	Protein Kinase C	MAGLGPGGGDSEGGPRPLFCRKGALRQKVVHEVKSHKFTARFFKQPTFCSHCTDFIWGIGKQGLQCQVCSFVVHRRCHEFVTFECPGAGKGPQTDDPRNKHKFRLHSYSSPTFCDHCGSLLYGLVHQGMKCSCCEMNVHRRCVRSVPSLCGVDHTERRGRLQLEIRAPTSDEIHITVGEARNLIPMDPNGLSDPYVKLKLIPDPRNLTKQKTKTVKATLNPVWNETFVFNLKPGDVERRLSVEVWDWDRTSRNDFMGAMSFGVSELLKAPVDGWYKLLNQEEGEYYNVPVADADNCSLLQKFEACNYPLELYERVRMGPSSSPIPSPSPSPTDSKRCFFGASPGRLHISDFSFLMVLGKGSFGKVMLAERRGSDELYAIKILKKDVIVQDDDVDCTLVEKRVLALGGRGPGGRPHFLTQLHSTFQTPDRLYFVMEYVTGGDLMYHIQQLGKFKEPHAAFYAAEIAIGLFFLHNQGIIYRDLKLDNVMLDAEGHIKITDFGMCKENVFPGSTTRTFCGTPDYIAPEIIAYQPYGKSVDWWSFGVLLYEMLAGQPPFDGEDEEELFQAIMEQTVTYPKSLSREAVAICKGFLTKHPGKRLGSGPDGEPTIRAHGFFRWIDWERLERLEIAPPFRPRPCGRSGENFDKFFTRAAPALTPPDRLVLASIDQADFQGFTYVNPDFVHPDARSPTSPVPVPVM	C1 domains of PKCs (PKC-alpha and PKC-gamma)PKC-alpha C1 domains.C1a -HKFIARFFKQPTFCSHCTDFIWGFGKQGFQCQVCCFVVHKRCHEFVTFSCNumber of amino acids: 50Molecular weight: 5968.0Theoretical pI: 8.82C1b -HKFKIHTYGSPTFCDHCGSLLYGLIHQGMKCDTCDMNVHKQCVINVPSLCNumber of amino acids: 50Molecular weight: 5624.5Theoretical pI: 7.81PKC-gamma C1 domainsC1aHKFTARFFKQPTFCSHCTDFIWGIGKQGLQCQVCSFVVHRRCHEFVTFECNumber of amino acids: 50Molecular weight: 5941.9Theoretical pI: 8.68C1bHKFRLHSYSSPTFCDHCGSLLYCLVHQGMKCSCCEMNVHRRCVRSVPSLCNumber of amino acids: 50Molecular weight: 5760.7Theoretical pI: 8.74,C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P63319			8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Pure, active recombinant TGF-beta 2 has been crystallized from polyethylene glycol 400.

1618771	Preparation, purification, and determination of the biological activities of 12 N terminus-truncated recombinant analogues of bovine placental lactogen.	Removal of 13 to 15 amino acids from the N terminus of bovine placental lactogen (bPL), which according to the three-dimensional structure of pGH corresponds to a nonhelical part of bPL, did not effect its secondary structure or change the monomer content of the protein preparation. However, it remarkably decreased the binding of the prolactin (PRL) type of receptors on Nb2 cells with subsequent reduction in bioactivity. The binding to the growth hormone (somatogen) receptors either did not change or was increased, resulting in an increase of somatogen receptor-mediated bioactivity. Further truncation (17-18 amino acids) resulted in a decrease of alpha-helical content and loss of binding properties and biological activity mediated through interaction of the analogues with both somatogen (3T3-F442A cells) and lactogen (PRL) receptors (NB2-11C cells). Truncation of 19-27 amino acids caused additional loss in activity, without further change in the secondary structure. Replacement of Leu28 by a more hydrophobic Phe has only minor, if any, effect on the bioactivity of bPL. Occasional point mutations due to polymerase chain reaction errors in several analogues did not seem to have any major effect on the hormone properties. It can thus be suggested that the N-terminal part of the nonhelical portion of bPL, which corresponds to the portion of the molecule that does not exist in growth hormones, is required for efficient binding to the lactogen (PRL) but not to the somatogen or unique bPL receptors. Removal of the N-terminal part of pBL changed the specificity of bPL by decreasing its PRL receptor-mediated activities and increasing its somatogen receptor-mediated activities.	1992 Jun	Gertler A,Hauser S D,Sakal E,Vashdi D,Staten N,Freeman J J,Krivi G G	The Journal of biological chemistry. 267(18) 12655-9	Placental lactogen	ASRIPLQSLFERATFVASNNYRLAREMFNEFNKQFGEGKNFTSKVINSCHTEFMTTPNNKEAAANTEDEALLRLVISLLHSWDEPLHQAVTELLHRNGASPDILARAKEIEDKTKVLLEGVEMIQKRVHPGEKKNEPYPVWSEKSSLTADDEDVRQTAFYRMFHCLHRDSSKISTYINLLKCRFTPC		P09611			11.3	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f
11259193	The 3&#39; end of hepatitis E virus (HEV) genome binds specifically to the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).	Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the major cause of acute epidemic and sporadic hepatitis in the developing world. It is a positive-strand RNA virus with a genome length of about 7.2 kb. The replication mechanism of this virus is virtually unexplored. Identification of the regulatory elements involved in initiation of replication may help in designing specific inhibitors for therapy. In the positive-stranded RNA viruses the initiation of replication requires interaction of the 3&#39; end of genome with its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and possibly host-derived cofactors for synthesis of the minus-strand replicative intermediate. Secondary structure prediction of the conserved 3&#39; end of the infectious HEV genome was carried out to identify possible stem-loop structures necessary for RNA-protein interaction and the model was confirmed by structure probing experiments. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed specific binding of purified and refolded recombinant HEV RdRp protein to the 3&#39; end of its RNA genome containing the poly(A) stretch. Mutations at the 3&#39; end, in which the stem-loop structures were partially or completely destroyed or recreated revealed that the two stem-loop structures SL1 and SL2 at the 3&#39; end and the poly(A) stretch are necessary for this binding. The interacting nucleotides in such an interaction were further identified by generating footprints of the complex by Pb(II)-induced hydrolysis. This specific binding of viral RdRp to the 3&#39; end of HEV RNA directs the synthesis of complementary-strand RNA and thus such a binding domain might assume the role of a possible cis-acting element as a potential site for the initiation of replication.	2001 Mar	Agrawal S,Gupta D,Panda S K	Virology. 282(1) 87-101	RNA Dependent RNA Polymerase	MAAPSQRKAVVSTLVGRYGRRTKLYNASHSDVRDSLARFIPAIGPVQVTTCELYELVEAMVEKGQDGSAVLELDLCNRDVSRITFFQKDCNKFTTGETIAHGKVGQGISAWSKTFCALFGPWFRAIEKAILALLPQGVFYGDAFDDTVFSAAVAAAKASMVFENDFSEFDSTQNNFSLGLECAIMEECGMPQGLIRLYHLIRSAWILQAPKESLLGFWKKHSGEPGTLLWNTVWNMAVITHCYDFRDLQVAAFKGDDSIVLCSEYRQSPGAAVLIAGCGLKLKVDFRPMRLYAGVVVAPGLGALPDVVRFAGRLTEKNWGPGPERADELRIAVSDFLRKLTNVAQMCVDVVSRVYGVSPGLVHNLIGMLQAVADGKAHFTESVKPVLDLTNSILCRVE	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q03495			7.4	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1592107	Efficient in vitro folding of the three-disulfide derivatives of hen lysozyme in the presence of glycerol.	Four derivatives of hen lysozyme, each lacking one native disulfide bond of the four in authentic lysozyme, were produced in Escherichia coli by expressing synthetic mutant genes. In the reoxidation reaction of the reduced derivatives purified from inclusion bodies, the addition of glycerol significantly enhanced the efficiency of folding and &#39;correct&#39; disulfide bond formation. This enabled simple chromatographical purification of refolded materials. Purified 3SS-derivatives all showed lytic activities and secondary structures comparable to authentic lysozyme, which directly showed that none of the four native disulfide bonds is a prerequisite for &#39;correct&#39; in vitro folding.	1992 May	Sawano H,Koumoto Y,Ohta K,Sasaki Y,Segawa S,Tachibana H	FEBS letters. 303(1) 11-4	Lysozyme	KVFGRSELAAAMKRHGLDNYRGYSLGNWVCAAKFESNFNTQATNRNTDGSTDYGILQINSRWWCNDGRTPGSRNLCNIPCSALLSSDITASVNCAKKIVSDGNGMNAWVAWRNRCKGTDVQAWIRGSRL		P00698			7.8	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f
10825531	Overproduction in Escherichia coli, purification and characterization of a family I.3 lipase from Pseudomonas sp. MIS38.	Determination of the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding a lipase from Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 (PML) revealed that PML is a member of the lipase family I.3 and is composed of 617 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 64510. Recombinant PML (rPML) was overproduced in Escherichia coli in an insoluble form, solubilized in the presence of 8 M urea, purified in a urea-denatured form and refolded by removing urea in the presence of the Ca(2+) ion. Gel filtration chromatography suggests that this refolded protein is monomeric. rPML showed relatively broad substrate specificities and hydrolyzed glyceryl tributyrate and olive oil with comparable efficiencies. rPML was active only in the form of a holo-enzyme, in which at least 12 Ca(2+) ions bound. These Ca(2+) ions bound too tightly to be removed from the protein upon dialysis, but were removed from it upon EDTA treatment. The resultant apo-enzyme was fully active in the presence of 10 mM CaCl(2), but was inactive in the absence of the Ca(2+) ion. PML has a GXSXG motif, which is conserved in lipases/esterases and generally contains the active-site serine. The mutation of Ser(207) within this motif to Ala completely inactivated PML, suggesting that Ser(207) is the active-site serine of PML.	2000 May	Amada K,Haruki M,Imanaka T,Morikawa M,Kanaya S	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1478(2) 201-10	Pseudomonas sp.

1618771	Preparation, purification, and determination of the biological activities of 12 N terminus-truncated recombinant analogues of bovine placental lactogen.	Removal of 13 to 15 amino acids from the N terminus of bovine placental lactogen (bPL), which according to the three-dimensional structure of pGH corresponds to a nonhelical part of bPL, did not effect its secondary structure or change the monomer content of the protein preparation. However, it remarkably decreased the binding of the prolactin (PRL) type of receptors on Nb2 cells with subsequent reduction in bioactivity. The binding to the growth hormone (somatogen) receptors either did not change or was increased, resulting in an increase of somatogen receptor-mediated bioactivity. Further truncation (17-18 amino acids) resulted in a decrease of alpha-helical content and loss of binding properties and biological activity mediated through interaction of the analogues with both somatogen (3T3-F442A cells) and lactogen (PRL) receptors (NB2-11C cells). Truncation of 19-27 amino acids caused additional loss in activity, without further change in the secondary structure. Replacement of Leu28 by a more hydrophobic Phe has only minor, if any, effect on the bioactivity of bPL. Occasional point mutations due to polymerase chain reaction errors in several analogues did not seem to have any major effect on the hormone properties. It can thus be suggested that the N-terminal part of the nonhelical portion of bPL, which corresponds to the portion of the molecule that does not exist in growth hormones, is required for efficient binding to the lactogen (PRL) but not to the somatogen or unique bPL receptors. Removal of the N-terminal part of pBL changed the specificity of bPL by decreasing its PRL receptor-mediated activities and increasing its somatogen receptor-mediated activities.	1992 Jun	Gertler A,Hauser S D,Sakal E,Vashdi D,Staten N,Freeman J J,Krivi G G	The Journal of biological chemistry. 267(18) 12655-9	Placental lactogen	ASRIPLQSLFERATLVASNNYRLAREMFNEFNKQFGEGKNFTSKVINSCHTEFMTTPNNKEAAANTEDEALLRLVISLLHSWDEPLHQAVTELLHRNGASPDILARAKEIEDKTKVLLEGVEMIQKRVHPGEKKNEPYPVWSEKSSLTADDEDVRQTAFYRMFHCLHRDSSKISTYINLLKCRFTPC		P09611			11.3	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f

Occasional point mutations due to polymerase chain reaction errors in several analogues did not seem to have any major effect on the hormone properties. It can thus be suggested that the N-terminal part of the nonhelical portion of bPL, which corresponds to the portion of the molecule that does not exist in growth hormones, is required for efficient binding to the lactogen (PRL) but not to the somatogen or unique bPL receptors. Removal of the N-terminal part of pBL changed the specificity of bPL by decreasing its PRL receptor-mediated activities and increasing its somatogen receptor-mediated activities.	1992 Jun	Gertler A,Hauser S D,Sakal E,Vashdi D,Staten N,Freeman J J,Krivi G G	The Journal of biological chemistry. 267(18) 12655-9	Placental lactogen	AVASNNYRLAREMFNEFNKQFGEGKNFTSKVINSCHTEFMTTPNNKEAAANTEDEALLRLVISLLHSWDEPLHQAVTELLHRNGASPDILARAKEIEDKTKVLLEGVEMIQKRVHPGEKKNEPYPVWSEKSSLTADDEDVRQTAFYRMFHCLHRDSSKISTYINLLKCRFTPC		P09611			11.3	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f

Four derivatives of hen lysozyme, each lacking one native disulfide bond of the four in authentic lysozyme, were produced in Escherichia coli by expressing synthetic mutant genes.

16233181	Role of repetitive nine-residue sequence motifs in secretion, enzymatic activity, and protein conformation of a family I.3 lipase.	A family I.3 lipase from Pseudomonas sp. MIS38 (PML) contains 12 repeats of a nine-residue sequence motif in the C-terminal region. To elucidate the role of these repetitive sequences, mutant proteins PML5, PML4, PML1, and PML0, in which 7, 8, 11, and all 12 of the repetitive sequences are deleted, and PMLdelta19, in which 19 C-terminal residues are truncated, were constructed. Escherichia coli DH5 cells carrying the Serratia marcescens Lip system permitted the secretion of the wild-type and all of the mutant proteins except for PMLdelta19, although they were partially accumulated in the cells in an insoluble form as well. Both the secretion level and cellular content of the proteins decreased in the order PML &gt; PML5 &gt; PML4 &gt; PML1 &gt; PML0, indicating that repetitive sequences are not required for secretion of PML but are important for its stability in the cells. All the mutant proteins were purified in a refolded form and their biochemical properties were characterized. CD spectra, the Ca2+ contents, and susceptibility to chymotryptic digestion strongly suggested that the five repetitive sequences remaining in PML5 are sufficient to form a beta-roll structure, whereas the four in PML4 are not. PML5 and PMLdelta19 showed both lipase and esterase activities, whereas PML4, PML1, and PML0 were inactive. These results suggest that the enzymatic activity of PML is not seriously affected by a deletion or truncation at the C-terminal region as long as a succession of repetitive sequences can build a beta-roll structure.	2002 	Kwon Hyun-Ju,Haruki Mitsuru,Morikawa Masaaki,Omori Kenji,Kanaya Shigenori	Journal of bioscience and bioengineering. 93(2) 157-64	Pseudomonas sp.

1924326	A soluble, single-chain T-cell receptor fragment endowed with antigen-combining properties.	A strategy for the production of small, soluble, single-chain T-cell receptor (scTCR) fragments that carry an intact TCR antigen-combining site is presented. The rationale is based on structural similarity between TCR and antibody molecules and use of computer modeling methods to derive a model structure of a human scTCR variable (V)-domain dimer. A gene encoding the RFL3.8 TCR protein, specific for the hapten fluorescein in the context of major histocompatibility complex class II and composed of one V alpha and one V beta domain joined via a flexible peptide linker, was assembled in an Escherichia coli plasmid. Subsequently, the protein was produced in a bacterial expression system, purified, refolded, and found to be poorly soluble at neutral pH in aqueous buffers. An inspection of the computer-generated V alpha-V beta domain model showed several surface exposed hydrophobic residues. When these were replaced by water-soluble side chains via site-directed mutagenesis of the corresponding gene, a soluble protein resulted and was shown to have antigen-binding properties equivalent to those of the intact TCR of the RFL3.8 T-cell clone. These results demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining TCR fragments endowed with antigen-combining properties by protein engineering in E. coli.	1991 Oct	Novotny J,Ganju R K,Smiley S T,Hussey R E,Luther M A,Recny M A,Siliciano R F,Reinherz E L	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 88(19) 8646-50	T-cell receptor	nagvtqtpkfrvlktgqsmtllcaqdmdheymywyrqdpgmglrlihysvgegttakgevpdgynvsrlkkqnpllglesaapsqtsvyfcasrtatqpqhfgdgtrlsilpggggsggggsggggsggggsgaqqqvkqspqslivqkggisiincayentafdkfpwyqqfpgkgpalliairpdvsekkegrftisfnksakqfslhimdsqpgdsatyfcaasfsgntplvfgkgtrlsvi	Single chain T-cell receptor, specific for hapten fluorescein in the context of major histocompatibility complex class II.

8144505	Intramolecular charge heterogeneity in purified major histocompatibility class II alpha and beta polypeptide chains.	Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II antigens are heterodimeric cell surface glycoproteins consisting of an alpha and a beta chain. Although one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified MHC class II antigens shows a single diffuse band for each chain, multiple spots of identical molecular size were observed for each chain when analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The basis of this heterogeneity has not been clearly defined and has been predicted partially to be due to glycosylation and/or phosphorylation of the mature protein. To investigate the role of the three N-linked oligosaccharides of the alpha and beta chains in determining the isoelectric point of each chain, affinity-purified MHC class II antigens from human and rat sources were deglycosylated using asparagine amidase. The complete enzymatic removal of all three N-linked oligosaccharides was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as well as by four different lectin-linked Western blot analyses. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the deglycosylated molecules shows no significant difference from the fully glycosylated chains. We have expressed truncated forms of the HLA DR2 chains which lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmically exposed regions in Escherichia coli. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of these single chains also reveal multiple banding patterns. The two-dimensional banding patterns described are unaffected by exposure to acidic or basic conditions, increased gel running time in the first dimension, treatment of the proteins with alkaline phosphatase to remove any potential phosphorylation, or preincubation in the presence of iodoacetamide. Multiple forms of recombinant alpha and beta chains were also observed in Tris-glycine-urea gels which merged into a single band in the presence of SDS. In addition, partially fractionated bands from preparative isoelectric focusing gels, when refocused, showed an identical number of multiple spots spanning the same range of isoelectric points. These results together suggest that each polypeptide chain of MHC class II antigens may exist in multiconformational forms, and the observed charge heterogeneity is independent of glycosylation and phosphorylation of the proteins.	1994 Apr	Nag B,Arimilli S,Koukis B,Rhodes E,Baichwal V,Sharma S D	The Journal of biological chemistry. 269(13) 10061-70	Human leukocyte antigen DR2 alpha chain	IKEEHVIIQAEFYLNPDQSGEFMFDFDGDEIFHVDMAKKETVWRLEEFGRFASFEAQGALANIAVDKANLEIMTKRSNYTPITNVPPEVTVLTNSPVELREPNVLICFIDKFTPPVVNVTWLRNGKPVTTGVSETVFLPREDHLFRKFHYLPFLPSTEDVYDCRVEHWGLDEPLLKHWEFDAPSPLPETTE	Transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains removed	P01903		Extracellular domain only aa.1-191	7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

15522201	In vitro assembly into virus-like particles is an intrinsic quality of Pichia pastoris derived HCV core protein.	Different variants of hepatitis C virus core protein (HCcAg) have proved to self-assemble in vitro into virus-like particles (VLPs). However, difficulties in obtaining purified mature HCcAg have limited these studies. In this study, a high degree of monomeric HCcAg purification was accomplished using chromatographic procedures under denaturing conditions. Size exclusion chromatography and sucrose density gradient centrifugation of renatured HCcAg (in the absence of structured RNA) under reducing conditions suggested that it assembled into empty capsids. The electron microscopy analysis of renatured HCcAg showed the presence of spherical VLPs with irregular shapes and an average diameter of 35nm. Data indicated that HCcAg monomers assembled in vitro into VLPs in the absence of structured RNA, suggesting that recombinant HCcAg used in this work contains all the information necessary for the assembly process. However, they also suggest that some cellular factors might be required for the proper in vitro assembly of capsids.	2004 Dec	Acosta-Rivero Nelson,Rodriguez Armando,Musacchio Alexis,Falcón Viviana,Suarez Viana M,Martinez Gillian,Guerra Ivis,Paz-Lago Dalila,Morera Yanelys,de la Rosa María C,Morales-Grillo Juan,Dueñas-Carrera Santiago	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 325(1) 68-74	Hepatitis C virus core protein	MSTNPKPQRKTKRNTNRRPQDVKFPGGGQIVGGVYLLPRRGPRLGVRATRKTSERSQPRGRRQPIPKARRPEGRTWAQPGYPWPLYGNEGMGWAGWLLSPRGSRPSWGPTDPRRRSRNLGKVIDTLTCGFADLMGYIPLVGAPLGGAARALAHGVRVLEDGVNYATGNLPGCSFSIFLLALLSCLTIPASAYEVRNVSGIYHVTNDCSNSSIVYEAADMIMHTPGCVPCVRESNFSRCWVALTPTLAARNSSIPTTTIRRHVDLLVGAAALCSAMYVGDLCGSVFLVSQLFTFSPRRYETVQDCNCSIYPGHVSGHRMAWDMMMNWSPTTALVVSQLLRI	UniProt Reference refers to HCV genotype 1b.

16014621	The plastid division protein AtMinD1 is a Ca2+-ATPase stimulated by AtMinE1.	Bacteria and plastids divide symmetrically through binary fission by accurately placing the division site at midpoint, a process initiated by FtsZ polymerization, which forms a Z-ring. In Escherichia coli precise Z-ring placement at midcell depends on controlled oscillatory behavior of MinD and MinE: In the presence of ATP MinD interacts with the FtsZ inhibitor MinC and migrates to the membrane where the MinD-MinC complex recruits MinE, followed by MinD-mediated ATP hydrolysis and membrane release. Although correct Z-ring placement during Arabidopsis plastid division depends on the precise localization of the bacterial homologs AtMinD1 and AtMinE1, the underlying mechanism of this process remains unknown. Here we have shown that AtMinD1 is a Ca2+-dependent ATPase and through mutation analysis demonstrated the physiological importance of this activity where loss of ATP hydrolysis results in protein mislocalization within plastids. The observed mislocalization is not due to disrupted AtMinD1 dimerization, however; the active site AtMinD1(K72A) mutant is unable to interact with the topological specificity factor AtMinE1. We have shown that AtMinE1, but not E. coli MinE, stimulates AtMinD1-mediated ATP hydrolysis, but in contrast to prokaryotes stimulation occurs in the absence of membrane lipids. Although AtMinD1 appears highly evolutionarily conserved, we found that important biochemical and cell biological properties have diverged. We propose that correct intraplastidic AtMinD1 localization is dependent on AtMinE1-stimulated, Ca2+-dependent AtMinD1 ATP hydrolysis, ultimately ensuring precise Z-ring placement and symmetric plastid division.	2005 Sep	Aldridge Cassie,Møller Simon Geir	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(36) 31673-8	AtMinD1	MASLRLFSTNHQSLLLPSSLSQKTLISSPRFVNNPSRRSPIRSVLQFNRKPELAGETPRIVVITSGKGGVGKTTTTANVGLSLARYGFSVVAIDADLGLRNLDLLLGLENRVNYTCVEVINGDCRLDQALVRDKRWSNFELLCISKPRSKLPMGFGGKALEWLVDALKTRPEGSPDFIIIDCPAGIDAGFITAITPANEAVLVTTPDITALRDADRVTGLLECDGIRDIKMIVNRVRTDMIKGEDMMSVLDVQEMLGLSLLGVIPEDSEVIRSTNRGFPLVLNKPPTLAGLAFEQAAWRLVEQDSMKAVMVEEEPKKRGFFSFFGG	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9MBA2			7	37	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9208485	Investigation of refolding condition for Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase by response surface methodology.	Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used to investigate optimal refolding conditions of Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase which was expressed as inclusion body in E. coli. Three interacting factors, protein concentration, pH and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) concentration were selected as the variables of RSM. The protein concentration did not affect the refolding yield within the selected range (50-340 micrograms ml-1) at low temperatures of 4 and -15 degrees C, but it was a critical factor at 25 degrees C and refolding yield significantly decreased with increasing protein concentration. The pH and GdnHCl were significant factors in all experimental conditions. But there was no trends of optimal pH depending on temperature and additives, just showing the optimum at neutral pH. Glycerol shifted optimal GdnHCl concentration to higher side, while arginine to lower side. Therefore, it was concluded that glycerol and arginine deprives and supplements GdnHCl, respectively. In this study, RSM made it possible to investigate successfully the optimal conditions of in vitro refolding and to elucidate interactions between refolding factors with a minimum number of experiments. Under the optimal condition determined by RSM, approximately 90% refolding yield was obtained and it was a 30 0ncrease over the conventional method.	1997 May	Ahn J H,Lee Y P,Rhee J S	Journal of biotechnology. 54(3) 151-60	SIK W1 lipase	MGVFDYKNLGTEASKTLFADATAITLYTYHNLDNGFAVGYQQHGLGLGLPATLVGALLGSTDSQGVIPGIPWNPDSEKAALDAVHAAGWTPISASALGYGGKVDARGTFFGEKAGYTTAQAEVLGKYDDAGKLLEIGIGFRGTSGPRESLITDSIGDLVSDLLAALGPKDYAKNYAGEAFGGLLKTVADYAGAHGLSGKDVLVSGHSLGGLAVNSMADLSTSKWAGFYKDANYLAYASPTQSAGDKVLNIGYENDPVFRALDGSTFNLSSLGVHDKAHESTTDNIVSFNDHYASTLWNVLPFSIANLSTWVSHLPSAYGDGMTRVLESGFYEQMTRDSTIIVANLSDPARANTWVQDLNRNAEPHTGNTFIIGSDGNDLIQGGKGADFIEGGKGNDTIRDNSGHNTFLFSGHFGQDRIIGYQPTDRLVFQGADGSTDLRDHAKAVGADTVLSFGADSVTLVGVGLGGLWSEGVLIS	Pseudomonas fluorescens SIK W1 lipase gene ligated into pTTY2 through unknown means.

16014621	The plastid division protein AtMinD1 is a Ca2+-ATPase stimulated by AtMinE1.	Bacteria and plastids divide symmetrically through binary fission by accurately placing the division site at midpoint, a process initiated by FtsZ polymerization, which forms a Z-ring. In Escherichia coli precise Z-ring placement at midcell depends on controlled oscillatory behavior of MinD and MinE: In the presence of ATP MinD interacts with the FtsZ inhibitor MinC and migrates to the membrane where the MinD-MinC complex recruits MinE, followed by MinD-mediated ATP hydrolysis and membrane release. Although correct Z-ring placement during Arabidopsis plastid division depends on the precise localization of the bacterial homologs AtMinD1 and AtMinE1, the underlying mechanism of this process remains unknown. Here we have shown that AtMinD1 is a Ca2+-dependent ATPase and through mutation analysis demonstrated the physiological importance of this activity where loss of ATP hydrolysis results in protein mislocalization within plastids. The observed mislocalization is not due to disrupted AtMinD1 dimerization, however; the active site AtMinD1(K72A) mutant is unable to interact with the topological specificity factor AtMinE1. We have shown that AtMinE1, but not E. coli MinE, stimulates AtMinD1-mediated ATP hydrolysis, but in contrast to prokaryotes stimulation occurs in the absence of membrane lipids.

8144505	Intramolecular charge heterogeneity in purified major histocompatibility class II alpha and beta polypeptide chains.	Major histocompatibility (MHC) class II antigens are heterodimeric cell surface glycoproteins consisting of an alpha and a beta chain. Although one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified MHC class II antigens shows a single diffuse band for each chain, multiple spots of identical molecular size were observed for each chain when analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The basis of this heterogeneity has not been clearly defined and has been predicted partially to be due to glycosylation and/or phosphorylation of the mature protein. To investigate the role of the three N-linked oligosaccharides of the alpha and beta chains in determining the isoelectric point of each chain, affinity-purified MHC class II antigens from human and rat sources were deglycosylated using asparagine amidase. The complete enzymatic removal of all three N-linked oligosaccharides was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as well as by four different lectin-linked Western blot analyses. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the deglycosylated molecules shows no significant difference from the fully glycosylated chains. We have expressed truncated forms of the HLA DR2 chains which lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmically exposed regions in Escherichia coli. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of these single chains also reveal multiple banding patterns. The two-dimensional banding patterns described are unaffected by exposure to acidic or basic conditions, increased gel running time in the first dimension, treatment of the proteins with alkaline phosphatase to remove any potential phosphorylation, or preincubation in the presence of iodoacetamide. Multiple forms of recombinant alpha and beta chains were also observed in Tris-glycine-urea gels which merged into a single band in the presence of SDS. In addition, partially fractionated bands from preparative isoelectric focusing gels, when refocused, showed an identical number of multiple spots spanning the same range of isoelectric points. These results together suggest that each polypeptide chain of MHC class II antigens may exist in multiconformational forms, and the observed charge heterogeneity is independent of glycosylation and phosphorylation of the proteins.	1994 Apr	Nag B,Arimilli S,Koukis B,Rhodes E,Baichwal V,Sharma S D	The Journal of biological chemistry. 269(13) 10061-70	Human leukocyte antigen DR3 beta chain	GDTRPRFLEYSTSECHFFNGTERVRYLDRYFHNQEENVRFDSDVGEFRAVTELGRPDAEYWNSQKDLLEQKRGRVDNYCRHNYGVVESFTVQRRVHPKVTVYPSKTQPLQHHNLLVCSVSGFYPGSIEVRWFRNGQEEKTGVVSTGLIHNGDWTFQTLVMLETVPRSGEVYTCQVEHPSVTSPLTVEWRARSESAQSK	Transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains removed	P01912		Extracellular domain only aa.1-198	7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial release factor was expressed from the cloned MRF1 gene, purified from inclusion bodies, and refolded to give functional activity. The gene encoded a factor with release activity that recognized cognate stop codons in a termination assay with mitochondrial ribosomes and in an assay with Escherichia coli ribosomes. The noncognate stop codon, UGA, encoding tryptophan in mitochondria, was recognized weakly in the heterologous assay. The mitochondrial release factor 1 protein bound to bacterial ribosomes and formed a cross-link with the stop codon within a mRNA bound in a termination complex. The affinity was strongly dependent on the identity of stop signal. Two alleles of MRF1 that contained point mutations in a release factor 1 specific region of the primary structure and that in vivo compensated for mutations in the decoding site rRNA of mitochondrial ribosomes were cloned, and the expressed proteins were purified and refolded.

15939877	Engineered single-chain dimeric streptavidins with an unexpected strong preference for biotin-4-fluorescein.	Streptavidin, a homotetrameric protein with extremely tight biotin binding (K(d) &lt; or = 10(-14) M), has been widely used as an affinity reagent. Its utility would be increased by engineering single-chain mutants with a wide spectrum of affinities, more suitable for phage-display and chip technologies. By a circular permutation procedure, we converted streptavidin to a single-chain dimer (SCD) with two biotin-binding sites and introduced random mutations by error-prone PCR. Clones from a phagemid library, expressed as gene-3 fusion proteins on M13 bacteriophage, were panned with biotinylated beads, and SCD genes from affinity-enriched phage were subcloned to produce soluble proteins. Purification of products from the original gene and two mutants by FPLC and analysis by MALDI-TOF MS showed they exist in both dimeric (single-chain) and tetrameric (two-chain) forms, which were further characterized for their binding affinity to biotin-4-fluorescein (B4F) by fluorescence polarization and intensity measurements. K&#39;(d) values for B4F ranged from approximately 10(-11) to 10(-10) M, although K(d) values for biotin ranged from 10(-6) to 10(-5) M. These results point to the possibility of combining an SCD streptavidin mutant with B4F derivatives to create a fluorescence-tagged affinity system with tight but still-reversible interaction that could be used sequentially with ordinary streptavidin-biotin for composite separation or analysis steps.	2005 Jun	Aslan Filiz M,Yu Yong,Mohr Scott C,Cantor Charles R	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 102(24) 8507-12	Streptavidin	MAEAGITGTWYNQLGSTFIVTAGADGALTGTYESAVGNAESRYVLTGRYDSAPATDGSGTALGWTVAWKNNYRNAHSATTWSGQYVGGAEARINTQWLLTSGTTEANAWKSTLVGHDTFTKVKPSAASGGGSSAEAGITGTWYNQLGSTFIVTAGADGALTGTYESAVGNAESRYVLTGRYDSAPATDGSGTALGWTVAWKNNYRNAHSATTWSGQYVGGAEARINTQWLLTSGTGSGFFLAAALEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P22629			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9108018	Refolding chromatography with immobilized mini-chaperones.	Mini-chaperones (e.g., a peptide consisting of residues 191-345 of GroEL) that are immobilized on agarose have very efficient chaperoning activity with several proteins that are otherwise recalcitrant to renaturation by conventional methods. We have used immobilized mini-chaperones both in column chromatography and batchwise to renature an insoluble protein from an inclusion body, to refold apparently irreversibly denatured proteins, and to recondition enzymes that have lost activity on storage. Refolding chromatography offers an efficient and simple means to renature proteins in high yield and with biological activity.	1997 Apr	Altamirano M M,Golbik R,Zahn R,Buckle A M,Fersht A R	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 94(8) 3576-8	Cyclophilin, Variant A	VNPTVFFDIAVDGEPLGRVSFELFADKVPKTAENFRALSTGEKGFGYKGSCFHRIIPGFMCQGGDFTRHNGTGGKSIYGEKFEDENFILKHTGPGILSMANAGPNTNGSQFFICTAKTEWLDGKHVVFGKVKEGMNIVEAMERFGSRNGKTSKKITIADCGQLE		P62937			7.8	25	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

3932354	Preparation and characterization of recombinant DNA-derived human interferon-gamma.	An attempt was made to prepare a highly purified, active recombinant DNA-derived human interferon-gamma. When the protein was denatured in urea and refolded, gel filtration and sedimentation velocity experiments indicated the presence of two forms, which are different in size and are not in a rapid reversible equilibrium. The two forms could be chromatographically separated. Far-UV circular dichroic spectra indicated the presence of secondary structures for both forms. Near-UV circular dichroic spectra revealed that the smaller form is folded into a rigid tertiary structure. The antiviral activity of the two forms of interferon-gamma showed a significant difference, i.e. the smaller form was 4-8-fold more active than the larger form. A variety of experiments show that the smaller form is more active, homogeneous, soluble, and stable than the larger form.	1985 Nov	Arakawa T,Alton N K,Hsu Y R	The Journal of biological chemistry. 260(27) 14435-9	Interferon gamma	CYCQDPYVKEAENLKKYFNAGHSDVADNGTLFLGILKNWKEESDRKIMQSQIVSFYFKLFKNFKDDQSIQKSVETIKEDMNVKFFNSNKKKRDDFEKLTNYSVTDLNVQRKAIHELIQVMAELSPAAKTGKRKRSQMLFRGRRASQ	Full length without signal sequence (1-20).

15713447	Leishmania donovani: identification of novel vaccine candidates using human reactive sera and cell lines.	Leishmaniasis is a complex of diseases caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Leishmania. The development of specific resistance against re-infection after cure suggests that a vaccine approach is feasible. Various studies in humans and experimental animals strongly suggest that Th1 type of cell-mediated immune response is important for protection against the disease. A defined antigen that could elicit a specific T-cell-mediated immune response in the host would be an ideal candidate for the vaccine against this parasite. In order to select a candidate antigen, we established a screening system to identify the recombinant clone, expressing antigen having T-cell epitopes from a cDNA library. We screened the library using an established Leishmania specific cell line (LSCL) from a naive healthy human subject. The cell line with predominantly CD4+ cells behaved in a Leishmania specific manner. Fifty-two immuno-reactive clones were screened against the LSCL in vitro and we identified three cDNA clones expressing recombinant antigens that could induce proliferation of these cells to produce INFgamma. The protective efficacy of one of these recombinant proteins was investigated in a hamster model of experimental visceral leishmaniasis and showed protection against a virulent challenge. The identified antigens might be potential candidates for vaccine against Leishmania.	2005 Mar	Arora Sunil K,Pal Nirbhai S,Mujtaba S	Experimental parasitology. 109(3) 163-70	Ribosomal protein P1-like protein	MITPSSKLTLTKGNKSWSSTAVAAALELVDPPGCRNMSAETLACTYAALMLSDAGLPTSAENIAAAVKAAGVEMRPTLPIIFARFLEKKSVETLMAAAAAQAPTAAXAPSPAAGAASAAXXGGKVEDKKKDEPEEEGDDDMGFGLFDGGPGTQFAL	Beta-galactosidase	Q8I867			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15313008	Bacterial expression of biologically active recombinant musarmin 1 from bulbs of Muscari armeniacum L. and Miller.	Musarmins are type 1 ribosome-inactivating proteins with N-glycosidase activity on the 28 S rRNA that are present in bulbs of Muscari armeniacum L. and Miller at rather low concentrations. In the present work, a cDNA fragment coding for musarmin 1 was sub-cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein (rMU1) was synthesised as a polypeptide of 295 amino acids that was delivered to the periplasm and processed. Recombinant musarmin 1 present in the periplam has two forms: insoluble with a molecular mass of 29,423 and soluble with a molecular mass of 29,117 because of a small proteolytic shortening with respect to the insoluble one, presumably in the C-terminal. The yield of protein homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 23mgl-1 of bacterial culture. The recombinant musarmin 1 forms isolated from both the soluble and the insoluble (upon refolding) fractions retained full translational inhibitory and 28 S rRNA N-glycosidase activities as compared with the native protein. The recombinant protein displayed great stability towards trypsin, collagenase, rat plasma and rat liver protein extract, but was sensitive to the action of papain and proteinase K. The easy availability and full activity of the recombinant musarmin 1 makes it a good candidate for the preparation of immunotoxins for targeted therapy and for the construction of transgenic plants expressing it as antipathogenic agent.	2004 Sep	Antolín Pilar,Girotti Alessandra,Arias Francisco Javier,Barriuso Begoña,Jiménez Pilar,Rojo Ma Angeles,Girbés Tomás	Journal of biotechnology. 112(3) 313-22	Type 1 ribosome-inactivating protein musarmin le	MKYLLPTAAAGLLLLAAQPAMAMAGQGFLTVEFTKTLNAVTLTSSTYTTFIRELRSRLAQTYVAGVPNIPVLPVYNQTQPPQGFDIVLTAGADRTTVRFRRDTLYLVGYQMQSGAWLEFGRAGNPQFIRGSEFLGFGGSYTELERLAGPVTSMDINQAKLVTSVRDLAVSTNSVVRAKALVVLIQMICEATRFIPISDHFASNLATDYAKLPPWMMSDLEKNWARISREVLKWDADTSYKIQPQTINGQTITTVEGLRPYLGILYRASVNPFSTSLYEEMKVGLEFAARRFGPVMVALAAALEIKRASQPELAPEDPEDVEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8LLV7			8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15861813	Transcriptional regulation of high pathogenicity island iron uptake genes by YbtA.	A large group of Enterobacteriaceae, including members of the genus Yersinia, produce the extracellular siderophore yersiniabactin enabling them to multiply under iron-depleted conditions. Genes, involved in yersiniabactin synthesis, transport and regulation are clustered in the high pathogenicity island (HPI). YbtA, an AraC-like transcriptional regulator, is presumed to be the central regulator of yersiniabactin production together with the ferric uptake regulator Fur. In this work, we identified the transcriptional start points of YbtA-regulated promoters of the HPI by primer extension, purified homogeneous YbtA and defined the YbtA-binding sites by DNaseI footprint analysis in ybtA, fyuA, irp6, and irp2 promoters. Besides of the anticipated pair repeats RS1 and RS2 in each promoter, we identified an additional YbtA-binding site designated RS3 in the divergently transcribed ybtA/irp6 promoter. Also, comparing ybtA/irp6 promoters of Y. enterocolitica and Y. pestis, we found that a 125-bp ERIC element insertion in the RS2 sequence of the Y. enterocolitica ybtA/irp6 promoter might increase YbtA expression, but did not affect expression of Irp6.	2005 Apr	Anisimov Roman,Brem Daniela,Heesemann Jürgen,Rakin Alexander	International journal of medical microbiology : IJMM. 295(1) 19-28	Yersiniabactin transcriptional regulator	MTESPQTQSEISINQLVVGKPANDGNIPAQCELLRCSLQEGMDILLWRGHFARPETLQLHDDLGRINFSCILEGTSRFAIQGLRRRTDWELARNRHYITHTPDCRGSASYCGRFESITLSFSPETLALWVPDISAVIKNKIDSHCCCLQQRCNAETHLTAQALRHALMRMHGGFSHEQKPSTLWLQGQSLVMLSLVLDEHREDASCLSCHFNPMERQKLLRAKDLLLADLTQAPGVAELARESGLSVLKIKRGFRVLFNNSVYGLFQAERMQEARRRLANGNTSVMTVAADLGYANASHFSAAFQKQFGVTPSTFKRVMDPAANKARKEAELAAATAEQ		Q9X9I4			8	37	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16019159	Molecular mechanism of YbtA-mediated transcriptional regulation of divergent overlapping promoters ybtA and irp6 of Yersinia enterocolitica.	Genes of Yersiniae spp. involved in production of the siderophore yersiniabactin are located on the high-pathogenicity island (HPI). Their transcription is controlled by the AraC/XilS-like transcriptional regulator YbtA encoded within the HPI. YbtA-regulated divergent and overlapping ybtA and irp6 promoters contain three YbtA binding sites, RS1, RS2 and RS3. Deleting RSs systematically and using ybtA and irp6 transcriptional fusions, we determined that different modes of YbtA binding are responsible for activation of irp6 and repression of ybtA. Based on these data, we propose a model of irp6 and ybtA promoter regulation.	2005 Sep	Anisimov Roman,Brem Daniela,Heesemann Jürgen,Rakin Alexander	FEMS microbiology letters. 250(1) 27-32	Yersiniabactin transcriptional regulator	MTESPQTQSEISINQLVVGKPANDGNIPAQCELLRCSLQEGMDILLWRGHFARPETLQLHDDLGRINFSCILEGTSRFAIQGLRRRTDWELARNRHYITHTPDCRGSASYCGRFESITLSFSPETLALWVPDISAVIKNKIDSHCCCLQQRCNAETHLTAQALRHALMRMHGGFSHEQKPSTLWLQGQSLVMLSLVLDEHREDASCLSCHFNPMERQKLLRAKDLLLADLTQAPGVAELARESGLSVLKIKRGFRVLFNNSVYGLFQAERMQEARRRLANGNTSVMTVAADLGYANASHFSAAFQKQFGVTPSTFKRVMDPAANKARKEAELAAATAEQ		Q9X9I4			8	37	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12010032	Intein-mediated synthesis of geranylgeranylated Rab7 protein in vitro.	Production of recombinant proteins is an important prerequisite for biotechnology and life sciences in general. However, there is a paucity of methods for production of posttranslationally modified recombinant proteins or proteins with non-native functional groups, such as fluorophores, spin labels, and so forth. In this work we have used a combination of organic synthesis and in vitro protein ligation to construct monoprenylated Rab7 GTPase. The protein was prepared from a recombinant N-terminal portion and a peptide mimicking the C terminus of Rab7. For construction of a synthetic six-amino-acid-long fluorescent monoprenylated peptide, we used a block condensation strategy. Ligation was achieved with a yield of &gt;70%. The resulting protein was purified from the unligated peptide by a combination of organic extraction and phase partitioning and refolding. The refolded monoprenylated semisynthetic Rab7 protein (Rab7GG) formed a stable complex with its natural chaperone REP-1 (Rab escort protein 1) and could serve as an acceptor of the second prenyl group in the enzymatic prenylation reaction. Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we characterized the interaction of the Rab7GG:REP-1 complex with Rab geranylgeranyl transferase and came to the conclusion that it functioned as a genuine intermediate of the prenylation reaction. Thus, we present the first example of the in vitro generation of a semisynthetic lipidated protein using the native chemical ligation method.	2002 May	Alexandrov Kirill,Heinemann Ines,Durek Thomas,Sidorovitch Vadim,Goody Roger S,Waldmann Herbert	Journal of the American Chemical Society. 124(20) 5648-9	Geranylgeranylated Rab7 protein	MTSRKKVLLKVIILGDSGVGKTSLMNQYVNKKFSNQYKATIGADFLTKEVMVDDRLVTMQIWDTAGQERFQSLGVAFYRGADCCVLVFDVTAPNTFKTLDSWRDEFLIQASPRDPENFPFVVLGNKIDLENRQVATKRAQAWCYSKNNIPYFETSAKEAINVEQAFQTIARNALKQETEVELYNEFPEPIKLDKNDRAKASAESCSC	Article did not clearly state which sequence the semisynthetic monoprenylated rab7 was derived from.

8973178	Expression of an olfactory receptor in Escherichia coli: purification, reconstitution, and ligand binding.	An olfactory receptor has been expressed in bacterial cells as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Overexpression of receptor protein yielding about 100f the cell protein was achieved with mutants lacking the N-terminus and the first transmembrane region or with mutants carrying three positively charged residues in the first intracellular loop. The overexpressed fusion protein accumulated in inclusion bodies and could be solubilized in detergent. It was purified by metal chelation chromatography based on a C-terminal 6-histidine tag, and the GST portion was removed after proteolytic cleavage. The purified receptor was reconstituted into lipid vesicles and specific binding of odor ligands was shown by photoaffinity labeling and tryptophan fluorescence measurements. Thus, for the first time, an odorant receptor/ligand pair becomes available in large amounts for biophysical and screening studies.	1996 Dec	Kiefer H,Krieger J,Olszewski J D,Von Heijne G,Prestwich G D,Breer H	Biochemistry. 35(50) 16077-84	Olfactory receptor 5	MSPILGYWKIKGLVQPTRLLLEYLEEKYEEHLYERDEGDKWRNKKFELGLEFPNLPYYIDGDVKLTQSMAIIRYIADKHNMLGGCPKERAEISMLEGAVLDIRYGVSRIAYSKDFETLKVDFLSKLPEMLKMFEDRLCHKTYLNGDHVTHPDFMLYDALDVVLYMDPMCLDAFPKLVCFKKRIEAIPQIDKYLKSSKYIAWPLQGWQATFGGGDHPPKSDLVPRGSPVEMSHHHHHHGEFRESSISHAVPLEEAWDPSTNSSHPNTQVEEKVNNVEEFTYMKFLKSFCKIMDFWPEREEKNSKTRIFRLRYILVLQFCFTLVAGVLYLKNNFGKKTFYDLGHTIITVVMNVVSVSRLILRCFKKYDVVGQQFINKIHLYHFRNDSEYSMKTYKAVHKISNNMTYIFSFSIFVCVVTFNLNPVFNNIGSGAYKNPRPDNVTLQQCVYYALPFDYTGDFKWYMLVAIFNVQKTFFCTSLFILFDLLLSMMIIHLWGHIRIFIHNLNHIPAPRNSLEYTREERQEVDNTLKKCIQHHTLIIGFVRIMSETYGLAVLIYYAFQQVVGCLLLLQCSRLDLKTITRFGFLTTMVNQQLIQISVIFELLGYMNDKLQEAVYCVPWEYMDTSHRKMVYMMFRQSQIPLQLKAMNMLSIGVKTMASILKTSVTYYLMLKTITANEA	GST-OR5  construct (basically full length protein),N-terminal GST and C-terminal hexahis	Q4W1W3			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
10919322	Production of interferon-alpha in high cell density cultures of recombinant Escherichia coli and its single step purification from refolded inclusion body proteins.	Escherichia coli TG1 transformed with a temperature-regulated interferon-alpha expression vector was grown to high cell density in defined medium containing glucose as the sole carbon and energy source, utilizing a simple fed-batch process. Feeding was carried out to achieve an exponential increase in biomass at growth rates which minimized acetate production. Thermal induction of such high cell density cultures resulted in the production of approximately 4 g interferon-alpha/l culture broth. Interferon-alpha was produced exclusively in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies and was solubilized under denaturing conditions, refolded in the presence of arginine and purified to near homogeneity, utilizing single-step ion-exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose. The yield of purified interferon-alpha was approximately 300 mg/l with respect to the original high cell density culture broth (overall yield of approximately 7.5% active interferon-alpha). The purified recombinant interferon-alpha was found by different criteria to be predominantly monomeric and possessed a specific bioactivity of approximately 2.5 x 10(8) IU/mg based on viral cytopathic assay.	2000 Jun	Babu K R,Swaminathan S,Marten S,Khanna N,Rinas U	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 53(6) 655-60	Interferon Alpha 2a	CDLPQTHSLGSRRTLMLLAQMRKISLFSCLKDRHDFGFPQEEFGNQFQKAETIPVLHEMIQQIFNLFSTKDSSAAWDETLLDKFYTELYQQLNDLEACVIQGVGVTETPLMKEDSILAVRKYFQRITLYLKEKKYSPCAWEVVRAEIMRSFSLSTNLQESLRSKE	Not specified which varient of IFN actually used.

9092813	Chemical synthesis, structural modeling, and biological activity of the epidermal growth factor-like domain of human cripto.	Cripto, also known as human teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1 (TDGF-1), contains a 40 amino acid region with some similarity to the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain. However, sequence homology is largely restricted to the classical cysteine/glycine motif with only limited similarities in other regions. Significant differences to human EGF include the absence of all seven residues between the two N-terminal half-cystines and a five-residue shorter loop between the third and fourth half-cystines. We examine the hypothesis that, in spite of these differences, cripto can adopt the characteristic EGF-like 1-3, 2-4, 5-6 disulfide bond pattern. A comparative structural model of the growth factor cripto was constructed on the basis of its similarity to EGF, transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha), and the EGF-like domain of human clotting factor IX. The predicted disulfide bridges and disulfide-bridged loops were analyzed and appear viable in the modeled structure. Moreover, to ascertain the importance of disulfide arrangement for cripto bioactivity, two 47-residue peptides were synthesized and then refolded using either a simple oxidative or a controlled sequential refolding protocol. The cripto peptides were tested for their ability to stimulate MAP-kinase activity, for inhibition of beta-casein induction, and for Shc phosphorylation in MDA-MB 453 human mammary carcinoma cells and HC-11 mouse mammary epithelial cells. Data suggest that cripto does adopt the 1-3, 2-4, 5-6 disulfide pattern and thus forms the classical EGF-like fold in spite of the significant deletions within the folding domain. The predicted structure of cripto shows some of the characteristics of both the ErbB1- and ErbB3/ErbB4-binding growth factors.	1997 Apr	Lohmeyer M,Harrison P M,Kannan S,DeSantis M,O&#39;Reilly N J,Sternberg M J,Salomon D S,Gullick W J	Biochemistry. 36(13) 3837-45	Teratocarcinoma-derived growth factor 1	VPPMGIQHSKELNRTCCLNGGTCMLGSFCACPPSFYGRNCEHDVRKE	CR47B construct	P13385		Epidermal growth factor-like domain aa.67-113	9	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7529765	Refolding and reconstitution of functionally active complexes of human leukocyte antigen DR2 and myelin basic protein peptide from recombinant alpha and beta polypeptide chains.	Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are cell surface heterodimeric glycoproteins consisting of one alpha and one beta polypeptide chain of similar size. These molecules play a critical role in immune recognition by displaying processed antigens to CD4-positive T helper cells. Several attempts to express the MHC class II molecules by recombinant methods in various systems resulted in either failure or poor recovery of the intact heterodimer. The present study describes our successful effort to refold and reconstitute HLA DR2 heterodimer from individually expressed alpha and beta polypeptide chains lacking the transmembrane hydrophobic regions in Escherichia coli, in the presence of an immunodominant epitope analog from human myelin basic protein (b-MBP(83-102)Y83). The reconstituted DR2 heterodimer complex was selectively purified from unfolded alpha and beta chains using heterodimer-specific monoclonal antibody (L243) coupled to a solid support. The detection of two polypeptide chains in the purified refolded DR2-peptide complex preparations was accomplished by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using heterodimer- and chain-specific polyclonal antibodies, and the presence of equimolar amounts of both alpha chain and beta chain in the reconstituted complex preparation was confirmed by a double label experiment. The quantitation of the bound peptide in complex preparation was measured by incubating two chains in the presence of 125I-labeled peptide. An increase in the yield of refolded and reconstituted DR2-peptide complexes was observed with increasing peptide concentration in the reaction mixture. Finally, the functional activity of the reconstituted DR2 complexes was measured by their ability to stimulate gamma-interferon production by SS8T cloned T cells in an antigen-specific and dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that biologically active complexes of human DR2.b-MBP (83-102)Y83 can be prepared by proper folding of human leukocyte antigen DR2 alpha and beta chains in the presence of antigenic peptide. The yield of such DR2 heterodimers with bound peptide is several thousand-fold higher over native DR2 purified from transformed B cells. Since purified MHC class II-peptide complexes have been shown to prevent autoimmune diseases in various animal models, reconstituted heterodimer complexes may have significant clinical relevance in antigen-specific treatment of various autoimmune diseases. In addition, such complexes with increased yield will provide better understanding of the trimolecular interactions between MHC-peptide and T cell receptor.	1995 Jan	Arimilli S,Cardoso C,Mukku P,Baichwal V,Nag B	The Journal of biological chemistry. 270(2) 971-7	Human Leukocyte Antigen DR2	MAISGVPVLGFFIIAVLMSAQESWAIKEEHVIIQAEFYLNPDQSGEFMFDFDGDEIFHVDMAKKETVWRLEEFGRFASFEAQGALANIAVDKANLEIMTKRSNYTPITNVPPEVTVLTNSPVELREPNVLICFIDKFTPPVVNVTWLRNGKPVTTGVSETVFLPREDHLFRKFHYLPFLPSTEDVYDCRVEHWGLDEPLLKHWEFDAPSPLPETTE		P01903			7.4	37	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

In addition, such complexes with increased yield will provide better understanding of the trimolecular interactions between MHC-peptide and T cell receptor.	1995 Jan	Arimilli S,Cardoso C,Mukku P,Baichwal V,Nag B	The Journal of biological chemistry. 270(2) 971-7	Human Leukocyte Antigen DR2	GDTRPRFLWQPKRECHFFNGTERVRFLDRYFYNQEESVRFDSDVGEYRAVTELGRPDAEYWNSQKDFLEDRRAAVDTYCRHNYGVGESFTVQRRVQPKVTVYPSKTQPLQHHNLLVCSVSGFYPGSIEVRWFLNGQEEKAGMVSTGLIQNGDWTFQTLVMLETVPRSGEVYTCQVEHPSVTSPLTVEWRARSESAQSK		P01903			7.4	37	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9084211	Method for increasing the yield of properly folded recombinant human gamma interferon from inclusion bodies.	A strategy is described for improved refolding and purification of recombinant human gamma interferon (rh-IFN gamma), which could warrant a higher yield and specific activity than reported previously. The optimal conditions of refolding are obtained by addition of a labilizing agent, L-arginine, in the refolding buffer. A 10-fold increase in the yield was observed with 0.5 M L-arginine, compared with renaturation in its absence. By varying renaturation parameters, the conditions that allow functional refolding of approximately 25-300f the recombinant protein have been standardized. A simple process is also described for the purification of rh-IFN gamma. The purification involves a single-column chromatography on S-Sepharose, after refolding of rh-IFN gamma in arginine containing buffer. This procedure has consistently produced rh-IFN gamma having a purity of at least 97%, the rest being the aggregated form of gamma interferon. The purified protein is a dimer under non-denaturing conditions and has a specific activity of 2 x 10(8) IU mg-1 protein, as measured by viral cytopathic assay.	1996 Dec	Arora D,Khanna N	Journal of biotechnology. 52(2) 127-33	Interferon gamma	CYCQDPYVKEAENLKKYFNAGHSDVADNGTLFLGILKNWKEESDRKIMQSQIVSFYFKLFKNFKDDQSIQKSVETIKEDMNVKFFNSNKKKRDDFEKLTNYSVTDLNVQRKAIHELIQVMAELSPAAKTGKRKRSQMLFRGRRASQ	No details of construct sequence given.

10964702	Affinity maturation of natural antibody using a chain shuffling technique and the expression of recombinant antibodies in Escherichia coli.	The affinity of natural antibody (Ka = 8 x 10(6) M(-1)) recognizing preS1 of hepatitis B virus (HBV) was improved by replacing the heavy (H) chain gene with repertoires of VH genes, obtained from two nonimmunized donors. Two separate clones, 1C2 and 1E4, showed affinities of 2.3 x 10(7) and 5.2 x 10(7) M(-1), which were increased by factors of 2.8 and 6.5, respectively, compared to the parental clone. Recombinant scFvs (rscFvs) were expressed as fusion protein with minor coat protein, pIII, and secreted into medium after 3 h of induction with 1 mM IPTG. The expression level of functional rscFv capable of binding to preS1 reached a peak after 6-10 h (1C2) and 8-10 h (1E4) of IPTG induction, and afterwards decreased gradually. In order to achieve the overexpression of rscFv in E. coli, gene encoding scFv of 1C2 or 1E4 was inserted into pRSET vector. RscFvs were overexpressed as cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in E. coli BL 21 strain, which were denatured and carefully refolded using a continuous dialysis system. The purified recombinant fragments were pure when analyzed by SDS-PAGE and had the predicted size of 34 kDa. Clone 1E4 used the heavy chain gene belonging to family VII and subgroup III. Chain shuffling offers an alternative to random point mutation for affinity maturation of human antibody in vitro.	2000 Aug	Park S G,Lee J S,Je E Y,Kim I J,Chung J H,Choi I H	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 275(2) 553-7	Single chain Fv 1E4 (anti-preS1 of hepatitis B virus)	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITCRASQGISNYLAWYQQKPGKVPKLLIYAASTLQSGVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTLTISSLQPEDVATYYCQKYNSAPLGGGTKVETKGGSSRSSSSGGGGSGGGGQVQLVQSGGGLVKPGGSLRLSCEASGFPFRDAWMTWVRQAPGRGLEWVGRIKKKSDGAATDQKASVKDRFTISRDDSKNMLWLQMNSLKVEDTAVYYCTRSVSSWYEYFYYYYMDLWFDPWGKGTTVTVSS	V(light)-18 residue linker-V(heavy),N-terminal hexahis + Xpress tag				8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12628297	Prohibitin and prohibitone are contained in high-molecular weight complexes and interact with alpha-actinin and annexin A2.	The closely related proteins prohibitin (p32) and prohibitone (p37) are evolutionarily conserved with homologues found from cyanobacteria to man. They are thought to be exclusively mitochondrial and have been assigned many-rather different-functions, ranging from a role in lifespan, in mitochondrial inheritance and as chaperones of mitochondrial proteases in yeast. Evidence for a localisation outside of mitochondria has been brought forward in mammalian cells, where they influence cell-cycle progression and are found in association with cell surface receptors. We have employed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify other interacting proteins and have identified alpha-actinin and annexin A2 as binding partners for prohibitin and prohibitone. Coprecipitation experiments supported the putative binding between prohibitin and prohibitone on the one hand and annexin A2 or alpha-actinin on the other hand in intact cells. Surface plasmon resonance analysis was used to determine relative affinities between prohibitin and alpha-actinin and between prohibitone and annexin A2 and alpha-actinin, respectively. We further show that prohibitin and prohibitone can also form homomeric (preferentially tetrameric) and heteromultimeric complexes, with significant affinities.	2002 Dec	Bacher Susanne,Achatz Gernot,Schmitz M L,Lamers Marinus C	Biochimie. 84(12) 1207-20	Prohibitin	MAAKVFESIGKFGLALAVAGGVVNSALYNVDAGHRAVIFDRFRGVQDIVVGEGTHFLIPWVQKPIIFDCRSRPRNVPVITGSKDLQNVNITLRILFRPVASQLPRIFTSIGEDYDERVLPSITTEILKSVVARFDAGELITQRELVSRQVSDDLTERAATFGLILDDVSLTHLTFGKEFTEAVEAKQVAQQEAERARFVVEKAEQQKKAAIISAEGDSKAAELIANSLATAGDGLIELRKLEAAEDIAYQLSRSRNITYLPAGQSVLLQLPQPWEDPDHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P35232			8	37	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9178478	Recombinant Opc meningococcal protein, folded in vitro, elicits bactericidal antibodies after immunization.	The meningococcal Opc protein has been expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. After cell disruption and successive washing of the insoluble fraction, insoluble proteins were solubilized in presence of the chaotropic agent guanidium hydrochloride. The extract was applied to a Reverse Phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC)-C4 column, for further purification. The obtained recombinant Opc protein was refolded in vitro, by the addition of several compounds to the resuspended solution. Over time, the progress of renaturation was tested by immunoblot with the human monoclonal antibody LuNm03 against the meningococcal Opc protein. LuNm03 recognizes a conformational epitope on the native meningococcal Opc protein. Having established the optimal conditions of renaturation. Balb/c mice were immunized to study the humoral immune response. The human at immune response elicited in mice was measured by ELISA and immunoblot, while the functional activity of these antibodies was assayed in a bactericidal test. According to our results, it was possible to obtain a recombinant Opc protein folded in vitro, with a conformation suitable enough to generate functional antibodies in mice, capable of killing meningococci in the presence of human complement.

12135557	High recovery of prochymosin from inclusion bodies using controlled air oxidation.	Refolding of proteins from inclusion bodies is a field of increasing interest for obtaining large amounts of active enzymes. Consequently, the development of inexpensive and scalable processes is required. This is particularly challenging in the case of eukaryotic proteins containing cysteines, which may form disulfide bonds in the native active protein. Previous studies have shown that the formation of disulfide bonds is essential for the refolding of prochymosin. In this work we demonstrate that air oxidation can be efficiently used for the refolding of prochymosin and that 480f the unfolded protein can be recovered as active enzyme at a final protein concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. Refolding of the protein strictly correlates with the change in pH of the refolding solution. We were able to follow the degree of oxidative renaturation of the prochymosin by simply measuring pH. Thus, the scaling up of the refolding system under controlled conditions was easily achieved. Analyses of different substances as folding aids indicate that the use of L-arginine or neutral surfactants improves the recovery of active protein up to 670f the initial protein. The overall results indicate that prochymosin can be efficiently and inexpensively refolded with high yields by controlled air oxidation.	2002 Jul	Menzella Hugo G,Gramajo Hugo C,Ceccarelli Eduardo A	Protein expression and purification. 25(2) 248-55	Prochymosin	MAEITRIPLYKGKSLRKALKEHGLLEDFLQKQQYGISSKYSGFGEVASVPLTNYLDSQYFGKIYLGTPPQEFTVLFDTGSSDFWVPSIYCKSNACKNHQRFDPRKSSTFQNLGKPLSIHYGTGSMQGILGYDTVTVSNIVDIQQTVGLSTQEPGDVFTYAEFDGILGMAYPSLASEYSIPVFDNMMNRHLVAQDLFSVYMDRNGQESMLTLGAIDPSYYTGSLHWVPVTVQQYWQFTVDSVTISGVVVACEGGCQAILDTGTSKLVGPSSDILNIQQAIGATQNQYGEFDIDCDNLSYMPTVVFEINGKMYPLTPSAYTSQDQGFCTSGFQSENH350SQKWILGDVFIREYYSVFDRANNLVGLAKAI	Prochymosin B allele: Gly244Prochymosin A allele: Asp244, same results	P00794			10.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

15774473	Molecular characterization of a purified 5-HT4 receptor: a structural basis for drug efficacy.	Serotonin 5-HT(4(a)) receptor, a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), was produced as a functional isolated protein using Escherichia coli as an expression system. The isolated receptor was characterized at the molecular level by circular dichroism (CD) and steady-state fluorescence. A specific change in the near-UV CD band associated with the GPCR disulfide bond connecting the third transmembrane domain to the second extracellular loop (e2) was observed upon agonist binding to the purified receptor. This is a direct experimental evidence for a change in the conformation of the e2 loop upon receptor activation. Different variations were obtained depending whether the ligand was an agonist (partial or full) or an inverse agonist. In contrast, antagonist binding did not induce any variation. These observations provide a first direct evidence for the fact that free (or antagonist-occupied), active (partial- or full agonist-occupied) and silent (inverse agonist-occupied) states of the receptor involve different arrangements of the e2 loop. Finally, ligand-induced changes in the fluorescence emission profile of the purified receptor confirmed that the partial agonist stabilized a single, well-defined, conformational state and not a mixture of different states. This result is of particular interest in a pharmacological perspective since it directly demonstrates that the efficacy of a drug is likely due to the stabilization of a ligand-specific state rather than selection of a mixture of different conformational states of the receptor.	2005 May	Banères Jean-Louis,Mesnier Danielle,Martin Aimée,Joubert Lara,Dumuis Aline,Bockaert Joel	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(21) 20253-60	5-hydroxytryptamine 4 receptor	MDKLDANVSSNEGFRSVEKVVLLTFLAVVILMAILGNLLVMVAVCRDRQLRKIKTNYFIVSLAFADLLVSVLVMPFGAIELVQDIWAYGEMFCLVRTSLDVLLTTASIFHLCCISLDRYYAICCQPLVYRNKMTPLRIALMLGGCWVLPMFISFLPIMQGWNNIGIVDVIEKRKFSHNSNSTWCVFMVNKPYAITCSVVAFYIPFLLMVLAYYRIYVTAKEHAQQIQMLQRAGATSESRPQPADQHSTHRMRTETKAAKTLCVIMGCFCFCWAPFFVTNIVDPFIDYTVPEQVWTAFLWLGYINSGLNPFLYAFLNKSFRRAFLIILCCDDERYKRPPILGQTVPCSTTTINGSTHVLRDAVECGGQWESRCHLTATSPLVAAQPSDTEHHHHHH	N-terminal KSI sequence, C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P97288			7.8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

12787679	Structure-based analysis of GPCR function: conformational adaptation of both agonist and receptor upon leukotriene B4 binding to recombinant BLT1.	We produced the human leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) receptor BLT1, a G-protein-coupled receptor, in Escherichia coli with yields that are sufficient for the first structural characterization of this receptor in solution. Overexpression was achieved through codon optimization and the search for optimal refolding conditions of BLT1 recovered from inclusion bodies. The detergent-solubilized receptor displays a 3D-fold compatible with a seven transmembrane (TM) domain with ca 50% alpha-helix and an essential disulfide bridge (circular dichroism evidence); it binds LTB(4) with K(a)=7.8(+/-0.2)x10(8)M(-1) and a stoichiometric ratio of 0.98(+/-0.02). Antagonistic effects were investigated using a synthetic molecule that shares common structural features with LTB(4). We report evidence that both partners, LTB(4) and BLT1, undergo a rearrangement of their respective conformations upon complex formation: (i) a departure from planarity of the LTB(4) conjugated triene moiety; (ii) a change in the environment of Trp234 (TM-VI helix) and in the exposure of the cytoplasmic region of this transmembrane helix.	2003 Jun	Baneres Jean-Louis,Martin Aimée,Hullot Pierre,Girard Jean-Pierre,Rossi Jean-Claude,Parello Joseph	Journal of molecular biology. 329(4) 801-14	Leukotriene B4 receptor 1	MNTTSSAAPPSLGVEFISLLAIILLSVALAVGLPGNSFVVWSILKRMQKRSVTALMVLNLALADLAVLLTAPFFLHFLAQGTWSFGLAGCRLCHYVCGVSMYASVLLITAMSLDRSLAVARPFVSQKLRTKAMARRVLAGIWVLSFLLATPVLAYRTVVPWKTNMSLCFPRYPSEGHRAFHLIFEAVTGFLLPFLAVVASYSDIGRRLQARRFRRSRRTGRLVVLIILTFAAFWLPYHVVNLAEAGRALAGQAAGLGLVGKRLSLARNVLIALAFLSSSVNPVLYACAGGGLLRSAGVGFVAKLLEGTGSEASSTRRGGSLGQTARSGPAALEPGPSESLTASSPLKLNELNSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q15722			8	20	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
16055003	UV-specific DNA repair recombinant fusion enzyme: a new stable pharmacologically active principle suitable for photoprotection.	BACKGROUND:UV radiation can produce mutations in skin cells and correlates strongly with the onset of actinic keratoses and basal and squamous cell carcinomas. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a heritable disease characterized by an extreme sensitivity of skin to UV radiation. Recently, studies in cultured cells as well as in XP patients have demonstrated that the recombinant T4 endonuclease V UV-specific endonuclease could enhance repair of UV-induced photoproducts.OBJECTIVE:We aimed to obtain a stable UV-specific DNA recombinant endonuclease, pharmacologically active in mammalian cells so as to be used in treatment and prophylaxis of sun damage.METHODS:The UV-specific DNA endonuclease gene obtained from Micrococcus luteus, was fused to a leader peptide and expressed (alphaUveA), refolded and purified. A construction under the control of an eukaryotic promoter was used to transfect XP fibroblasts deficient in DNA damage repair. Transformed cells were UV irradiated and cell survival was assessed.RESULTS:alphaUveA was obtained as a highly active UV-specific repair enzyme stable for at least 2 years. XP fibroblasts transfected with alphaUveA gene increased the resistance to UV radiation and, in consequence, cell survival.CONCLUSION:alphaUveA is stable and pharmacologically active in human cells. The topical administration of this long-term stable new active principle could help diminish the risks of skin cancer after sun exposure.	2005 Aug	Basílico Guillermo,Roger Carolina Alvarez,Seigelchifer Mauricio,Kerner Nestor	Journal of dermatological science. 39(2) 81-8	Pyrimidine dimer DNA glycosylase	MRLWPLHPRHLDRQGLTGAWREALLAQAVLAGRTRGYRDHPQLLRFREHPDPSGAIGAFLSGLEAEATARGYRFDHSRIDRPCPAPDGAVRIPPAGLAPIPATTGQRDLEWRHLCAKLAVRSPAWLEQWSDTPVPDVHPLFTIVPGPVASERAS	No details on vector given.

11829501	Characterization of two highly similar Rad51 homologs of Physcomitrella patens.	The moss Physcomitrella patens, which is a land plant with efficient homologous recombination, encodes two Rad51 proteins (PpaRad51.1 and PpaRad51.2). The PpaRad51.1 and PpaRad51.2 proteins, which share 94  0dentity between them, interact with themselves and with each other. Both proteins bind ssDNA and dsDNA in a Mg(2+) and pH-dependent manner, with a stoichiometry of one PpaRad51.1 monomer per 3(+/-1) nt or bp and one PpaRad51.2 monomer per 1(+/-0.5) nt or bp, respectively. At neutral pH, a 1.6-fold excess of both proteins is required for ssDNA and dsDNA binding. PpaRad51.1 and PpaRad51.2 show ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity and efficiently promote strand annealing in a nucleotide-independent but in a Mg(2+)-dependent manner. Both proteins promote joint-molecule formation, DNA strand invasion and are able to catalyse strand exchange in the presence of Mg(2+) and ATP. No further increase in the activities is observed when both proteins are present in the same reaction. None of the PpaRad51 gene products complement the DNA repair and recombination phenotype of Saccharomyces cerevisiae rad51delta mutants. However, PpaRad51.1 confers a dominant-negative DNA repair phenotype, and both PpaRad51 proteins reduce the levels of double-strand break-induced recombination when overexpressed in S. cerevisiae wt cells. These results suggest that both PpaRad51 proteins are bona fide Rad51 proteins that may contribute, in a different manner, to homologous recombination, and that they might replace ScRad51 in a hypothetical yeast protein complex inactivating different functions required for recombinational repair.	2002 Feb	Ayora Silvia,Piruat José I,Luna Rosa,Reiss Bernd,Russo Vincenzo E A,Aguilera Andrés,Alonso Juan C	Journal of molecular biology. 316(1) 35-49	Rad51A protein	MATVSAATEGVTEEEVHHGPYLVEQLQNCGISSLDLKKLKDAGFCTVESVAYSAKKDLVLIKGLSDAKDKIIEAATKLVPMGFTSAKQMHEQRAELIQITTGAKEFDILEGGIETGSITEIYGEFRSEKSQICHTLCVTCQLPLDQGGGEGKALYIDAEGTFRPQRLLQIAEKYGLNGQDVLDNVAYARAYNTDHQMKLLVEAASMMAETRFALMVVDSSTALYRTDYSGRGELAARQVHLAKFLRGCQKIADEFGIAVVITNQVVAQVDGSAMFNGPQHKPIGGNIIAHASTTRLSVRKGRGEERVIKVVASPCLAEQEQRFQITNEGAVDVKE	Sequence provided refers to recA protein only.

8930126	Renaturation of SPARC expressed in Escherichia coli requires isomerization of disulfide bonds for recovery of biological activity.	SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, also known as osteonectin and BM-40) belongs to a group of secreted macromolecules that modulate cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix. During vertebrate embryogenesis, as well as in tissues undergoing remodeling and repair, the expression pattern of SPARC is consistent with a fundamental role for this protein in tissue morphogenesis and cellular differentiation. Human SPARC was cloned by the polymerase chain reaction from an endothelial cell cDNA library and was expressed in Escherichia coli as a biologically active protein. Two forms of recombinant SPARC (rSPARC) were recovered from BL21(DE3) cells after transformation with the plasmid pSPARCwt: a soluble, monomeric form that is biologically active (Bassuk et al., 1996, Archiv. Biochem. Biophys. 325, 8-19), and an insoluble form sequestered in inclusion bodies. Aggregated rSPARC was unfolded by urea treatment, purified by nickel-chelate affinity chromatography, and renatured by gradual removal of the denaturant. Proper isomerization of the disulfide bonds was achieved in the presence of a glutathione redox couple. After final purification by high resolution gel filtration chromatography, a monomeric form of rSPARC displaying biological activity was obtained. The recombinant protein inhibited the spreading and synthesis of DNA by endothelial cells, two properties characteristic of the native protein. We conclude that the information for the correct folding of rSPARC resides in the primary structure of the protein, and suggest that post-translational modifications are required neither for folding nor for biological activity.	1996 Sep	Bassuk J A,Braun L P,Motamed K,Baneyx F,Sage E H	The international journal of biochemistry &amp; cell biology. 28(9) 1031-43	Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine	MAPQQEALPDETEVVEETVAEVTEVSVGANPVQVEVGEFDDGAEETEEEVVAENPCQNHHCKHGKVCELDENNTPMCVCQDPTSCPAPIGEFEKVCSNDNKTFDSSCHFFATKCTLEGTKKGHKLHLDYIGPCKYIPPCLDSELTEFPLRMRDWLKNVLVTLYERDEDNNLLTEKQKLRVKKIHENEKRLEAGDHPVELLARDFEKNYNMYIFPVHWQFGQLDQHPIDGYLSHTELAPLRAPLIPMEHCTTRFFETCDLDNDKYIALDEWAGCFGIKQKDIDKDLVILEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P09486			7.8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12957141	The stability of human acidic beta-crystallin oligomers and hetero-oligomers.	Crystallins are bulk structural proteins of the eye lens that have to last a life time. They gradually become modified with age, denature and form light scattering centres. High thermodynamic and kinetic stability of the crystallins enables them to resist unfolding and delay cataract. Here we have made recombinant human betaA1-, betaA3-, and betaA4-crystallins. The betaA3-crystallin formed higher oligomers that lead to precipitation at ambient temperature. Heat-induced precipitation of betaA3-crystallin was compared with human and calf betaB2-crystallins, showing that the human proteins start to precipitate above 50 degrees C while the calf betaB2-crystallin stays in solution even when unfolded. The stabilities of these human acidic beta-crystallin homo-oligomers have been estimated by measuring their unfolding in urea at neutral pH. BetaA3/1/betaB1 and betaA4/betaB1-crystallin hetero-oligomers have been prepared from homo-oligomers by subunit exchange. The resolution of the methodology used was insufficient to detect a stabilization of the betaA4-crystallin subunit in the hetero-oligomer, the betaA1-crystallin subunit was clearly stabilized by its interaction with betaB1-crystallin. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies show that homo-dimer surface tryptophans become buried in the betaA3/1/betaB1-crystallin hetero-dimer concomitant with changes in polypeptide chain conformation.	2003 Oct	Bateman O A,Sarra R,van Genesen S T,Kappé G,Lubsen N H,Slingsby C	Experimental eye research. 77(4) 409-22	Beta crystallin B1	MSEAAKASASATVAVNPGPDTKGKGAPPAGTSPSPGTTLAPTTVPITSAKAAELPPGNYRLVVFELENFQGRRAEFSGECSNLADRGFDRVRSIIVSAGPWVAFEQSNFRGEMFILEKGEYPRWNTWSSSYRSDRLMSFRPIKMDAQEHKISLFEGANFKGNTIEIQGDDAPSLWVYGFSDRVGSVKVSSGTWVGYQYPGYRGYQYLLEPGDFRHWNEWGAFQPQMQSLRRLRDKQWHLEGSFPVLATEPPAANKARKEAELAAATAEQ	C-terminal sequence	P53674			7.3	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f

16213519	Preprotein translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane: reconstituted Tom40 forms a characteristic TOM pore.	Tom40 is the central pore-forming component of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM complex). Different views exist about the secondary structure and electrophysiological characteristics of Tom40 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Neurospora crassa. We have directly compared expressed and renatured Tom40 from both species and find a high content of beta-structure in circular dichroism measurements in agreement with refined secondary structure predictions. The electrophysiological characterization of renatured Tom40 reveals the same characteristics as the purified TOM complex or mitochondrial outer membrane vesicles, with two exceptions. The total conductance of the TOM complex and outer membrane vesicles is twofold higher than the total conductance of renatured Tom40, consistent with the presence of two TOM pores. TOM complex and outer membrane vesicles possess a strongly enhanced sensitivity to a mitochondrial presequence compared to Tom40 alone, in agreement with the presence of several presequence binding sites in the TOM complex, suggesting a role of the non-channel Tom proteins in regulating channel activity.	2005 Nov	Becker Lars,Bannwarth Michael,Meisinger Chris,Hill Kerstin,Model Kirstin,Krimmer Thomas,Casadio Rita,Truscott Kaye N,Schulz Georg E,Pfanner Nikolaus,Wagner Richard	Journal of molecular biology. 353(5) 1011-20	Translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane Tom40	MSAPTPLAEASQIPTIPALSPLTAKQSKGNFFSSNPISSFVVDTYKQLHSHRQSLELVNPGTVENLNKEVSRDVFLSQYFFTGLRADLNKAFSMNPAFQTSHTFSIGSQALPKYAFSALFANDNLFAQGNIDNDLSVSGRLNYGWDKKNISKVNLQISDGQPTMCQLEQDYQASDFSVNVKTLNPSFSEKGEFTGVAVASFLQSVTPQLALGLETLYSRTDGSAPGDAGVSYLTRYVSKKQDWIFSGQLQANGALIASLWRKVAQNVEAGIETTLQAGMVPITDPLMGTPIGIQPTVEGSTTIGAKYEYRQSVYRGTLDSNGKVACFLERKVLPTLSVLFCGEIDHFKNDTKIGCGLQFETAGNQELLMLQQGLDADGNPLQALPQLGRDPAANKARKEAELAAATAEQ	C-terminal sequence	P23644			8.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
11403574	TAT-mediated protein transduction into mammalian cells.	Manipulation of mammalian cells has been achieved by the transfection of expression vectors, microinjection, or diffusion of peptidyl mimetics. While these approaches have been somewhat successful, the classic manipulation methods are not easily regulated and can be laborious. One approach to circumvent these problems is the use of HIV TAT-mediated protein transduction. Although this technology was originally described in 1988, few improvements were reported in the subsequent 10 years. In the last few years, significant steps have been taken to advance this technology into a broadly applicable method that allows for the rapid introduction of full-length proteins into primary and transformed cells. The technology requires the synthesis of a fusion protein, linking the TAT transduction domain to the molecule of interest using a bacterial expression vector, followed by the purification of this fusion protein under either soluble or denaturing conditions. The purified fusion protein can be directly added to mammalian cell culture or injected in vivo into mice. Protein transduction occurs in a concentration-dependent manner, achieving maximum intracellular concentrations in less than 5 min, with nearly equal intracellular concentrations between all cells in the transduced population. Full-length TAT fusion proteins have been used to address a number of biological questions, relating to cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cellular architecture.

A detailed protocol for production and transduction of TAT-Cdc42 into primary cells is given to illustrate the technique.	2001 Jul	Becker-Hapak M,McAllister S S,Dowdy S F	Methods (San Diego, Calif.). 24(3) 247-56	Cell division control protein 42 homolog	MHHHHHHYGRKKRRQRRRMGGGMQTIKCVVVGDGAVGKTCLLISYTTNKFPSEYVPTVFDNYAVTVMIGGEPYTLGLFDTAGQEDYDRLRPLSYPQTDVFLVCFSVVSPSSFENVKEKWVPEITHHCPKTPFLLVGTQIDLRDDPSTIEKLAKNKQKPITPETAEKLARDLKAVKYVECSALTQKGLKNVFDEAILAALEPPEPKKSRRCVLL	N-terminal hexahis + TAT sequence	P60953			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
16103153	Characterization of an antisense transcript spanning the UL81-82 locus of human cytomegalovirus.	In this study we present the characterization of a novel transcript, UL81-82ast, UL81-82 antisense transcript, and its protein product. The transcript was initially found in a cDNA library of monocytes from a seropositive donor. mRNA was obtained from monocytes isolated from a healthy donor with a high antibody titer against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The mRNAs were cloned into a lambda phage-derived vector to create the cDNA library. Using PCR, UL81-82ast was amplified from the library. The library was tested for the presence of numerous HCMV genes. Neither structural genes nor immediate-early genes were found. UL81-82ast was detected in five bone marrow samples from healthy antibody-positive donors. This same transcript was also found in in vitro-infected human fibroblasts early after infection but disappears at the same time that UL82 transcription begins. Not only was the transcript amplified using reverse transcription-PCR and sequenced but its protein product (UL82as protein) was detected by both Western blot and immunofluorescence. Phylogenetic studies using UL82as protein were conducted, showing a high degree of conservation in clinical isolates, laboratory strains of HCMV, and even in chimpanzee CMV. The transcript could be involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of the UL82 gene, affecting its mRNA stability or translation. Since the UL82 product, pp71, functions as an immediate-early transactivator, its posttranscriptional control could have some effect over latency reactivation and lytic replication.	2005 Sep	Bego Mariana,Maciejewski J,Khaiboullina S,Pari G,St Jeor S	Journal of virology. 79(17) 11022-34	UL82as	MTSVRAPLLPLRRLCPVRISAGDSPAWVSESSSPLASSKPANNASDRGVGVGVEERSSSSSSSSSSSSSSVGGNPGDCGRNSHTAPRMTLLRGKRPARSCTWGRKGLILSGLPGVRVQHPRRKKWMRPSGCRCSKGKPIPNPLLGLDSHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahis +V6 epitope				8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9882554	Preparation of recombinant gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) growth hormone and its use for stimulation of larvae growth by oral administration.	Gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) growth hormone (gsGH) cDNA coding for the mature protein was cloned in a pGEM-T vector and then transferred into prokaryotic expression vector pET-8 and expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells upon induction with IPTG. The expressed protein, contained within the inclusion-body pellet, was solubilized in 4.5 M urea, refolded at pH 11.3 in the presence of catalytic amounts of cysteine, and purified to over 98d0c850urity, as evidenced by SDS-PAGE. Gel-filtration on a Superdex column under nondenaturing conditions and partial amino acid N-terminal sequence showed the purified protein to be a monomeric alanyl-gsGH. Over 90d0c850ure bacterial beta-lactamase was copurified as a by-product. Binding assays of the [125I]gsGH to gs liver microsomal fraction resulted in high specific binding characterized by a Kd = 1.93 nM. Recombinant gsGH, like ovine placental lactogen, exhibited growth-stimulating activity when applied orally to S. aurata larvae or intraperitoneally to juvenile fish.	1999 Jan	Ben-Atia I,Fine M,Tandler A,Funkenstein B,Maurice S,Cavari B,Gertler A	General and comparative endocrinology. 113(1) 155-64	Growth Hormone	MAQPITDGQRLFSIAVSRVQHLHLLAQRLFSDFESSLQTEEQPQLNKIFLQDFCNCDYIISPIDKHETQRSSVLKLLSISYRLVESWEFPSRSLSGGSAPRNQISPKLSELKTGIHLLIRANEDGAEIFPDRSALQLAPYGNYYQSLGTDESLRRTYELLACFKKDMHKVETYLTVAKCRLSSVGST	Sequence refers to GH fragment altered using specific primers prior to insertion into pET8 plasmid as no details on plasmid could be found.

10375403	GroEL-assisted and -unassisted refolding of mature and precursor adrenodoxin: the role of the precursor sequence.	We have performed refolding studies on a [2Fe-2S] protein, adrenodoxin (Adx), and its precursor form, preadrenodoxin. In vitro, mature Adx is expressed as a soluble active form in Escherichia coli, but precursor Adx is expressed in inclusion bodies. Both mature and precursor Adx refolded spontaneously from their denatured forms and the recovery levels of enzyme activities were 40 and 37 0.000000or mature and precursor Adx, respectively. Furthermore, the interaction between GroEL- and Gdn-HCl-denatured mature and precursor forms was investigated. In the case of mature Adx, the activity was increased in the presence of either GroEL, GroES, or bovine serum albumin and the refolding of mature Adx is a nonspecific process. However, the GroEL-mediated reaction is specific for precursor Adx under the experimental conditions used here. A higher electron transfer activity is obtained after ATP addition to the GroEL-containing refolding mixture, and GroEL-precursor complexes were found by gel chromatography studies. Our observation suggests that the small single-domain protein Adx (mature form) folded independently of the chaperonin GroEL. The contribution of the chaperonin complexes to the folding is toward the aggregation-sensitive precursor Adx, which in vitro folded 1.3- to 1.4-fold slower than mature Adx. This demonstrates that the presequence is responsible for the formation of inclusion bodies and for the in vitro recognition motif for GroEL binding.	1999 Jul	Bera A K,Bernhardt R	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 367(1) 89-94	Adrenodoxin	MAARLLRVASAALGDTAGRWRLLARPRAGAGGLRGSRGPGLGGGAVATRTLSVSGRAQSSSEDKITVHFINRDGETLTTKGKIGDSLLDVVVQNNLDIDGFGACEGTLACSTCHLIFEQHIFEKLEAITDEENDMLDLAYGLTDRSRLGCQICLTKAMDNMTVRVPDAVSDARESIDMGMNSSKIPAANKAREAELAAATAEE	C-terminal sequence	P00257			7.5	20	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11896403	Cysteine-rich module structure reveals a fulcrum for integrin rearrangement upon activation.	Cysteine-rich repeats in the integrin beta subunit stalk region relay activation signals to the ligand-binding headpiece. The NMR solution structure and disulfide bond connectivity of Cys-rich module-3 of the integrin beta2 subunit reveal a nosecone-shaped variant of the EGF fold, termed an integrin-EGF (I-EGF) domain. Interdomain contacts between I-EGF domains 2 and 3 observed by NMR support a model in which the modules are related by an approximate two-fold screw axis in an extended arrangement. Our findings complement a 3.1 A crystal structure of the extracellular portion of integrin alphaVbeta3, which lacks an atomic model for I-EGF2 and a portion of I-EGF3. The disulfide connectivity of I-EGF3 chemically assigned here differs from the pairings suggested in the alphaVbeta3 structure. Epitopes that become exposed upon integrin activation and residues that restrain activation are defined in beta2 I-EGF domains 2 and 3. Superposition on the alphaVbeta3 structure reveals that they are buried. This observation suggests that the highly bent alphaVbeta3 structure represents the inactive conformation and that release of contacts with I-EGF modules 2 and 3 triggers a switchblade-like opening motion extending the integrin into its active conformation.	2002 Apr	Beglova Natalia,Blacklow Stephen C,Takagi Junichi,Springer Timothy A	Nature structural biology. 9(4) 282-7	Integrin beta-2	HGKGFLECGICRCDTGYIGKNCECQTQGRSSQELEGSCRKDNNSIICSGLGDCV	Sequence refers only to the sequence of the integrin fragment as details on expression vector were not supplied	P05107			8.2	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t

8234294	Formation of functional peptide complexes of class II major histocompatibility complex proteins from subunits produced in Escherichia coli.	Class II major histocompatibility complex molecules play a major role in the immune response by binding peptide fragments of exogenous antigens and displaying them on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells, where they can be recognized by T cells. To facilitate structural and functional studies of these molecules, we have produced truncated alpha and beta chains of the murine class II molecule I-Ek in Escherichia coli (Ec-I-Ek) and have developed conditions to fold them in the presence of specific peptides with yields of complex approaching 2%. Reconstitution is specific since only unlabeled peptide known to bind I-Ek compete with biotinylated peptide, as assessed by ELISA. Complexes of the refolded heterodimer (Ec-I-Ek) with either of two different peptide antigens remain associated during nonreducing SDS/PAGE. Immobilized Ec-I-Ek-peptide complexes stimulate lymphokine production by three T-cell clones in an antigen-specific manner with a dose-response relation comparable to previously described soluble I-Ek molecules produced in CHO cells. These results demonstrate that folding of Ek alpha and Ek beta polypeptides does not require any other protein to produce the biologically relevant conformation and that carbohydrate modification of this class II molecule is not necessary for alpha beta T-cell recognition.	1993 Nov	Altman J D,Reay P A,Davis M M	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 90(21) 10330-4	Major histocompatibility complex class I	IKEEHTIIQAEFYLSPDQNGEFMFDFDGDEIFHVDIKKSETIWRLEEFAQFASFEAQGALANIAVDKANLDIMIKRSNNTPDAN		O98177			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

12202256	On-column tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine reduction and IC5-maleimide labeling during purification of a RpoC fragment on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Column.	Fluorescence labeling of proteins has become increasingly important since fluorescent techniques like FRET and fluorescence polarization are now commonly used in protein binding studies, proteomics, and for high-throughput screening in drug discovery. In our efforts to study the binding of the beta(&#39;)-subunit from Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) to sigma70, we synthesized a fluorescent-labeled beta(&#39;)-fragment (residues 100-309) in a very convenient way, that could be used as a general protocol for hexahistidine-tagged proteins. By performing all the following steps, purification, reduction, derivatization with IC5-maleimide, and free dye removal while the protein was bound to the column, we were able to reduce the procedure time significantly and at the same time achieve better labeling efficiency and quality. The beta(&#39;)-fragment with a N-terminal His(6)-tag was purified from inclusion bodies and could be refolded prior to or after binding to a Ni-NTA affinity column. Reduction prior to labeling was achieved with TCEP that does not interfere with Ni-NTA chemistry. The labeled beta(&#39;)-fragment was tested with sigma70 that was labeled with an europium-based fluorophore for binding in a electrophoretic mobility-shift assay. The sigma-to-core protein interaction in bacterial RNA polymerase offers a potentially specific target for drug discovery, since it is highly conserved among the eubacteria, but differs significantly from eukaryotes.	2002 Aug	Bergendahl Veit,Anthony Larry C,Heyduk Tomasz,Burgess Richard R	Analytical biochemistry. 307(2) 368-74	RNA polymerase	MARRASVHHHHHHMGHIELASPTAHIWFLKSLPSRIGLLLDMPLRDIERVLYFESYVVIEGGMTNLERQQILTEEQYLDALEEFGDEFDAKMGAEAIQALLKSMDLEQECEQLREELNETNSETKRKKLTKRIKLLEAFVQSGNKPEWMILTVLPVLPPDLRPLVPLDGGRFATSDLNDLYRRVINRNNRLKRLLDLAAPDIIVRNEKRMLQEAVDALLDNG	N-terminal Hexahis tag + HMK recognition sequence	P0A8T7		Beta-prime subunit	7.5	20	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

14580717	The N-terminus of human prolactin modulates its biological properties.	The N-terminus is the most divergent region within the prolactin (PRL)/placental lactogen (PL)/growth hormone (GH) family. Since all of these ligands are able to activate the lactogen receptor, it has been usually assumed that the N-terminus plays no major role in biological actions of any family member. In this study, we generated several analogs of human PRL in which the N-terminus was truncated by 9 and iteratively up to the 14 first residues. Truncation did not alter protein folding, and it even decreased the formation of PRL aggregates that appear during the purification of refolded protein. Removal of the entire N-terminal loop (14 residues) decreased the affinity for the receptor by two-three-fold, and reduced the ability of the hormone to activate the human lactogen receptor. In contrast, removal of 13 or less residues improves receptor activation since these analogs are able to produce supra-maximal activities in a transcriptional bioassay, or in proliferation assays exhibit dose-response curves that are less bell-shaped, which reflects enhanced stabilization of receptor dimers. Altogether, these data suggest that the N-terminus of PRL is actually slightly detrimental to bioactivity, but may be required for other properties of the hormone.	2003 Oct	Bernichtein Sophie,Jomain Jean-Baptiste,Kelly Paul A,Goffin Vincent	Molecular and cellular endocrinology. 208(1-2) 11-21	Prolactin	MRSQVTLRDLFDRAVVLSHYIHNLSSEMFSEFDKRYTHGRGFITKAINSCHTSSLATPEDKEQAQQMNQKDFLSLIVSILRSWNEPLYHLVTEVRGMQEAPEAILSKAVEIEEQTKRLLEGMELIVSQVHPETKENEIYPVWSGLPSLQMADEESRLSAYYNLLHCLRRDSHKIDNYLKLLKCRIIH		P01236			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

Truncation did not alter protein folding, and it even decreased the formation of PRL aggregates that appear during the purification of refolded protein. Removal of the entire N-terminal loop (14 residues) decreased the affinity for the receptor by two-three-fold, and reduced the ability of the hormone to activate the human lactogen receptor. In contrast, removal of 13 or less residues improves receptor activation since these analogs are able to produce supra-maximal activities in a transcriptional bioassay, or in proliferation assays exhibit dose-response curves that are less bell-shaped, which reflects enhanced stabilization of receptor dimers. Altogether, these data suggest that the N-terminus of PRL is actually slightly detrimental to bioactivity, but may be required for other properties of the hormone.	2003 Oct	Bernichtein Sophie,Jomain Jean-Baptiste,Kelly Paul A,Goffin Vincent	Molecular and cellular endocrinology. 208(1-2) 11-21	Prolactin	MLRDLFDRAVVLSHYIHNLSSEMFSEFDKRYTHGRGFITKAINSCHTSSLATPEDKEQAQQMNQKDFLSLIVSILRSWNEPLYHLVTEVRGMQEAPEAILSKAVEIEEQTKRLLEGMELIVSQVHPETKENEIYPVWSGLPSLQMADEESRLSAYYNLLHCLRRDSHKIDNYLKLLKCRIIH		P01236			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

9846755	A Mycobacterium tuberculosis operon encoding ESAT-6 and a novel low-molecular-mass culture filtrate protein (CFP-10).	The early secreted antigenic target 6 kDa protein (ESAT-6) is a potent T-cell protein antigen synthesized by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Its corresponding gene (esat-6) is located in RD1, a 10 kb DNA region deleted in the attenuated tuberculosis vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis BCG. The promoter region of M. tuberculosis esat-6 was cloned and characterized. A new gene, designated lhp and cotranscribed with esat-6, was identified. Moreover, computer searches in the M. tuberculosis genome identified 13 genes related to the lhp/esat-6 operon, defining a novel gene family. The transcription initiation sites of the lhp/esat-6 operon were mapped using M. tuberculosis RNA. The corresponding promoter signals were not recognized in Mycobacterium smegmatis, in which transcription of lhp/esat-6 is initiated at different locations. The M. tuberculosis lhp gene product was identified as CFP-10, a low-molecular-mass protein found in the short-term culture filtrate. These results show that the genes encoding CFP-10 and ESAT-6 are transcribed together in M. tuberculosis and that both code for small exported proteins.	1998 Nov	Berthet F X,Rasmussen P B,Rosenkrands I,Andersen P,Gicquel B	Microbiology (Reading, England). 144 ( Pt 11) 3195-203	Culture Filtrate Protein 10	HHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMAEMKTDAATLGQEAGNFERISGDLKTQIDQVESTAGSLQGQWRGAAGTAAQAAVVRFQEAANKQKQELDEISTNIRQAGVQYSRADEEQQQALSSQMGF	N-terminal poly-histidine tag	P0A566			8.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8143876	Achievement of renaturation of subtilisin BPN&#39; by a novel procedure using organic salts and a digestible mutant of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor.	The pro-sequences of proteases have been considered to be required for the refolding of denatured proteases. However, here we report achievement of almost complete restoration of enzymatic activity of subtilisin BPN&#39; in the absence of its pro-sequence. The presence of 2 M potassium acetate in the folding medium enhanced the refolding efficiency of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-denatured subtilisin BPN&#39; by up to 28%, and other organic salts were also found to be useful, suggesting that general contribution of the bulky hydrophobic moieties of the salts to the formation of a favorable environment required for folding. This finding will provide new insights into the folding mechanisms not only of proteases but also of various other proteins. Almost complete restoration of enzymatic activity of denatured subtilisin in the organic salt solution was accomplished by further addition of mutated Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI), which had been converted to a digestible temporary inhibitor by removal of the disulfide bridge near the reactive site.	1994 Apr	Matsubara M,Kurimoto E,Kojima S,Miura K,Sakai T	FEBS letters. 342(2) 193-6	Subtilisin BPN	QSVPYGVSQIKAPALHSQGYTGSNVKVAVIDSGIDSSHPDLKVAGGASMVPSETNPFQDNNSHGTHVAGTVAALNNSIGVLGVAPSASLYAVKVLGADGSGQYSWIINGIEWAIANNMDVINMSLGGPSGSAALKAAVDKAVASGVVVVAAAGNEGTSGSSSTVGYPGKYPSVIAVGAVDSSNQRASFSSVGPELDVMAPGVSIQSTLPGNKYGAYNGTSMASPHVAGAAALILSKHPNWTNTQVRSSLENTTTKLGDSFYYGKGLINVQAAAQ	Mature protein without the pro-sequence refolded	P00782			6.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
8062906	Renaturation of the mature subtilisin BPN&#39; immobilized on agarose beads.	We report here another example of renaturation of subtilisin BPN&#39;(Sbtl) by using an immobilized preparation instead of applying a digestible mutant of Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI), a proteinaceous inhibitor of Sbtl [M. Matsubara et al. (1994) FEBS Letters 342, 193-196]. The mature Sbtl was immobilized on agarose beads employing the amino group of the protein. After thorough washing, the immobilized Sbtl was subjected to denaturation in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) at pH 2.4 for 4 h, followed by renaturation in 2 M potassium acetate at pH 6.5 for 24 h. This denaturation/renaturation cycle was repeated five times. The recovered activity of the renatured immobilized Sbtl settled at a constant level after the third denaturation/renaturation cycle, demonstrating that almost 100% renaturation was attained by use of the immobilized Sbtl. This immobilized Sbtl preparation could well be utilized for the mechanistic study of protein folding. We then found that 2 M potassium acetate was superior to 2 M potassium chloride as a refolding medium and that the ability of SSI to induce the correct shape of the mature Sbtl was lacking in several refolding media in both thermodynamic and kinetic criteria. Thus the main cause for the increase of refolding yield of Sbtl by coexistence of SSI was prevention of the autolysis of Sbtl.	1994 Aug	Hayashi T,Matsubara M,Nohara D,Kojima S,Miura K,Sakai T	FEBS letters. 350(1) 109-12	Subtilisin BPN	QSVPYGVSQIKAPALHSQGYTGSNVKVAVIDSGIDSSHPDLKVAGGASMVPSETNPFQDNNSHGTHVAGTVAALNNSIGVLGVAPSASLYAVKVLGADGSGQYSWIINGIEWAIANNMDVINMSLGGPSGSAALKAAVDKAVASGVVVVAAAGNEGTSGSSSTVGYPGKYPSVIAVGAVDSSNQRASFSSVGPELDVMAPGVSIQSTLPGNKYGAYNGTSMASPHVAGAAALILSKHPNWTNTQVRSSLENTTTKLGDSFYYGKGLINVQAAAQ		P00782			6.5	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11023789	Solution structure of the TAZ2 (CH3) domain of the transcriptional adaptor protein CBP.	The TAZ2 (CH3) domain of the transcriptional adapter protein CBP has been implicated in direct functional interactions with numerous cellular transcription factors and viral oncoproteins. The solution structure of the TAZ2 domain of murine CBP has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The protein adopts a novel helical fold stabilized by three zinc ions, each of which is bound to one histidine and three cysteine ligands in HCCC-type motifs. Each zinc-binding site is formed from the carboxy terminus of an alpha-helix, a short loop, and the amino terminus of the next alpha-helix. A peptide derived from the N-terminal transactivation domain of p53 binds specifically to one face of the TAZ2 domain. The close similarities between the TAZ2 and TAZ1 (CH1 domain of CBP/p300) sequences suggest that both domains will adopt similar three-dimensional structures.	2000 Oct	De Guzman R N,Liu H Y,Martinez-Yamout M,Dyson H J,Wright P E	Journal of molecular biology. 303(2) 243-53	CREB-binding protein	MSPQESRRLSIQRCIQSLVHACQCRNANCSLPSCQKMKRVVQHTKGCKRKTNGGCPVCKQLIALCCYHAKHCQENKCPVPFCLNIKHK	Zinc-binding domain	P45481		TAZ2 domain (aa.1764-1850)	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f
11959977	Structural basis for Hif-1 alpha /CBP recognition in the cellular hypoxic response.	The cellular response to low tissue oxygen concentrations is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1. Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1 activates transcription of critical adaptive genes by recruitment of the general coactivators CBP/p300 through interactions with its alpha-subunit (Hif-1 alpha). Disruption of the Hif-1 alpha/p300 interaction has been linked to attenuation of tumor growth. To delineate the structural basis for this interaction, we have determined the solution structure of the complex between the carboxy-terminal activation domain (CAD) of Hif-1 alpha and the zinc-binding TAZ1 (CH1) motif of cyclic-AMP response element binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CBP). Despite the overall similarity of the TAZ1 structure to that of the TAZ2 (part of the CH3) domain of CBP, differences occur in the packing of helices that can account for differences in specificity. The unbound CAD is intrinsically disordered and remains relatively extended upon binding, wrapping almost entirely around the TAZ1 domain in a groove through much of its surface. Three short helices are formed upon binding, stabilized by intermolecular interactions. The Asn-803 side chain, which functions as a hypoxic switch, is located on the second of these helices and is buried in the molecular interface. The third helix of the Hif-1 alpha CAD docks in a deep hydrophobic groove in TAZ1, providing extensive intermolecular hydrophobic interactions that contribute to the stability of the complex. The structure of this complex provides new insights into the mechanism through which Hif-1 alpha recruits CBP/p300 in response to hypoxia.	2002 Apr	Dames Sonja A,Martinez-Yamout Maria,De Guzman Roberto N,Dyson H Jane,Wright Peter E	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 99(8) 5271-6	CREB-binding protein	MADPEKRKLIQQQLVLLLHAHKCQRREQANGEVRACSLPHCRTMKNVLNHMTHCQAPKACQVAHCASSRQIISHWKNCTRHDCPVCLPLKNASDKR	Zinc-binding domain	P45481		TAZ1 domain (aa.345-439)	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f
8880901	Structural characterization of the tumor suppressor p16, an ankyrin-like repeat protein.	The p16 protein has been identified as a tumor suppressor that functions by inhibiting the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. Deletions or point mutations in the p16 gene have been found in a number cancers, emphasizing its importance in regulating cell cycle progression. Inhibition by p16 occurs through protein-protein interactions with its targets. This is not surprising, since p16 is thought to contain ankyrin-like repeats, motifs implicated in protein-protein interactions. Our goal was to identify structural characteristics of p16 not only as an important step towards understanding CDK4 inhibition but also to explore the role of ankyrin repeats in the p16 structure, as no detailed structure of any protein containing these motifs has been reported. We have expressed, refolded, and purified p16 from E. coli and have shown it to be functionally active by specific binding to CDK4. Analytical ultracentrifugation has shown that p16 weakly self-associates to form dimers with a Kd = 270 microM. The CD spectrum indicates that the protein is composed of 33% alpha-helix, 220eta-sheet, 190eta-turn, and 270ther (which includes aromatic and random coil contributions). Further CD experiments suggest that p16 exhibits low structural stability with a delta G of -2.3 kcal/mol. This weak stability is a consequence of a highly dynamic structure as measured by ANS-binding, NMR hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and fluorescence. It is possible that a well-defined tertiary structure is imparted upon the binding of p16 to CDK4.	1996 Sep	Boice J A,Fairman R	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 5(9) 1776-84	Tumor suppressor p16	MEPSADWLATAAARGRVEEVRALLEAGALPNAPNSYGRRPIQVMMMGSARVAELLLLHGAEPNCADPATLTRPVHDAAREGFLDTLVVLHRAGARLDVRDAWGRLPVDLAEELGHRDVARYLRAAAGGTRGSNHARIDAAEGPSDIPDSEPELRRQACACGRTRAPPPPPLRSGC	C-terminal sequence	P42771			8.4	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t
8535163	Expression in Escherichia coli and purification of human eosinophil-derived neurotoxin with ribonuclease activity.	Eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) is a ribonuclease with neurotoxic and helminthotoxic properties. It is present in the crystalloid granules of human eosinophils. We report the expression and characterization of a functionally active recombinant human EDN using the pMAL-cRI expression system. A cDNA for mature EDN was obtained by PCR and inserted in pMAL-cRI downstream of the malE gene encoding maltose binding protein. Induction of the ptac promoter of the plasmid in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) resulted in high level expression of soluble MAL-EDN fusion protein. Cleavage of affinity purified fusion protein with Factor Xa protease released recombinant EDN which comigrated with native EDN on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and cross-reacted with a polyclonal anti-EDN antiserum on Western blots. IN contrast to previous attempts at EDN expression, denatured and refolded EDN had ribonuclease activity and was prepared in microgram amounts. The availability of recombinant human EDN should facilitate studies of its structure and biological functions.	1995 Oct	Sun L,Li M S,Fisher L M,Spry C J	Protein expression and purification. 6(5) 685-92	Ribonuclease 2	SLHVKPPQFTWAQWFETQHINMTSQQCTNAMQVINNYQRRCKNQNTFLLTTFANVVNVCGNPNMTCPSNKTRKNCHHSGSQVPLIHCNLTTPSPQNISNCRYAQTPANMFYIVACDNRDQRRDPPQYPVVPVHLDRII	N-terminal maltose binding protein	P10153			8.2	22	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8019413	Characteristics of a de novo designed protein.	A series of 204 amino acid proteins intended to form TIM (triose phosphate isomerase) barrel structures were designed de novo. Each protein was synthesized by expression of the synthetic gene as a fusion protein with a portion of human growth hormone in an Escherichia coli host. After BrCN treatment, the protein was purified to homogeneity. The refolded proteins are globular and exist as monomers. One of the designed proteins is stable toward guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) denaturation, with a midpoint of 2.6 M determined from CD and tryptophan fluorescence measurements. The GuHCl denaturation is well described by a 2-state model. The NMR spectra, the thermal denaturation curves, and the 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid binding imply that the stability of the protein arises mainly from hydrophobic interactions, which are probably of a nonspecific nature.

10820025	Analysis of the properties of the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of human P-glycoprotein.	Human P-glycoprotein, the MDR1 gene product, requires both Mg(2+)-ATP binding and hydrolysis to function as a drug transporter; however, the mechanism(s) defining these events is not understood. In the present study, we explored the nature of Mg(2+)-ATP binding in the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of human P-glycoprotein and identified the minimal functional unit required for specific ATP binding. Recombinant proteins encompassing amino acids within the region beginning at 348 and ending at 707 were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions, and renatured by rapid dilution. The ability of ATP to interact with these proteins was examined by use of the photoactive ATP analogue [alpha-(32)P]-8-azido-ATP. Photoaffinity labeling of recombinant proteins identified the region between amino acids 375 and 635 as the region necessary to obtain specific ATP-binding properties. Specific protein labeling was saturable, enhanced by Mg(2+), and inhibited by ATP. Recombinant proteins confined within the region beginning at amino acid 392 and ending at amino acid 590 demonstrated nonspecific [alpha-(32)P]-8-azido-ATP labeling. Nonspecific labeling was not enhanced by Mg(2+) and was inhibited only by high concentrations of ATP. Using a D555N mutated protein, we found that the conserved aspartate residue in the Walker B motif plays a role in magnesium-enhanced ATP-binding. Taken together, these data define the region of the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of P-glycoprotein that is required for specific ATP binding and suggest that magnesium may play a role in stabilizing the ATP-binding site.	2000 May	Booth C L,Pulaski L,Gottesman M M,Pastan I	Biochemistry. 39(18) 5518-26	P-Glycoprotein	ARGAAYEIFKIIDNKPSIDSYSKSGHKPDNIKGNLEFRNVHFSYPSRKEVKILKGLNLKVQSGQTVALVGNSGAGKSTTVQLMQRLYDPTEGMVSVDGQDIRTINVRFLREIIGVVSQEPVLFATTIAENIRYGRENVTMDEIEKAVKEANAYDFIMKLPHKFDTLVGERGAQLSGGQKQRIAIARALVRNPKILLLDEATSALDTESEAVVQVALDKARKGRTTIVIAHRLSTVRNADVIAGFDDGVIVEKGNHDELMKEKGIYFKLVTMQTAGNEVELENAADESKSEIDALEMSSNDSRSSLIRKRSTRRSVRGSQAQDRKLSTKEALDESIPPVSFWRIMKLNLTEGS	pET-NBD1MDR1-C431A (358-707)	P08183		N-Terminal Nucleotide Binding Domain	8	10	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

8011940	De novo design and creation of a stable artificial protein.	Protein de novo design has been performed, as an exercise of the inverse folding problem. A beta/alpha-barrel protein was designed and synthesized using the Escherichia coli expression system for the structural characterization. A tertiary model with a two-fold symmetry was built, based upon the geometrical parameters extracted from X-ray crystal structures of several beta/alpha-barrel proteins. Amino acid frequencies at each position on the alpha- and beta-structures were investigated, and an amino acid sequence with 201 residues was designed. The associated gene was chemically synthesized and the fusion protein with human growth hormone was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified protein after being cleaved and refolded was found to be stable and globular with the large amount of secondary structures. However, it has similar characteristics to the molten globules of natural proteins, with loose packing of side-chains. The approach for the tight packing is discussed.	1994 May	Tanaka T,Hayashi M,Kimura H,Oobatake M,Nakamura H	Biophysical chemistry. 50(1-2) 47-61	De novo designed protein - TIM barrel	RAGYVFVWLHGLDNPEKLLKAFEKNGADQVVFGTQPGLNPEKLLKALEKKGLPVILAIEGADNPEKLLKAFEKNGADYIIFYTQPGLNPEKLLKALEKKGLPVFVWLHGLDNPEKLLKAFEKNGADQVVFGTQPGLNPEKLLKALEKKGLPVILAIEGADNPEKLLKAFEKNGADYIIFYTQPGLNPEKLLKALEKKGAGR	N-terminal human growth hormone portion (aa.1-122)				4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f
10820025	Analysis of the properties of the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of human P-glycoprotein.	Human P-glycoprotein, the MDR1 gene product, requires both Mg(2+)-ATP binding and hydrolysis to function as a drug transporter; however, the mechanism(s) defining these events is not understood. In the present study, we explored the nature of Mg(2+)-ATP binding in the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of human P-glycoprotein and identified the minimal functional unit required for specific ATP binding. Recombinant proteins encompassing amino acids within the region beginning at 348 and ending at 707 were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions, and renatured by rapid dilution. The ability of ATP to interact with these proteins was examined by use of the photoactive ATP analogue [alpha-(32)P]-8-azido-ATP. Photoaffinity labeling of recombinant proteins identified the region between amino acids 375 and 635 as the region necessary to obtain specific ATP-binding properties. Specific protein labeling was saturable, enhanced by Mg(2+), and inhibited by ATP. Recombinant proteins confined within the region beginning at amino acid 392 and ending at amino acid 590 demonstrated nonspecific [alpha-(32)P]-8-azido-ATP labeling. Nonspecific labeling was not enhanced by Mg(2+) and was inhibited only by high concentrations of ATP. Using a D555N mutated protein, we found that the conserved aspartate residue in the Walker B motif plays a role in magnesium-enhanced ATP-binding. Taken together, these data define the region of the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of P-glycoprotein that is required for specific ATP binding and suggest that magnesium may play a role in stabilizing the ATP-binding site.	2000 May	Booth C L,Pulaski L,Gottesman M M,Pastan I	Biochemistry. 39(18) 5518-26	P-Glycoprotein	ARGAAYEIFKIIDNKPSIDSYSKSGHKPDNIKGNLEFRNVHFSYPSRKEVKILKGLNLKVQSGQTVALVGNSGAGKSTTVQLMQRLYDPTEGMVSVDGQDIRTINVRFLREIIGVVSQEPVLFATTIAENIRYGRENVTMDEIEKAVKEANAYDFIMKLPHKFDTLVGERGAQLSGGQKQRIAIARALVRNPKILLLDEATSALDTESEAVVQVALDKARKGRTTIVIAHRLS	pET-NBD1MDR1-C431A (358-590)	P08183		N-Terminal Nucleotide Binding Domain Mutant	8	10	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

8525616	Interaction of bovine leukemia virus transactivator Tax with bZip proteins.	The bovine leukemia virus transactivator, BLV Tax, augments transcription from three imperfect 21-bp repeats in the viral transcriptional regulatory region. Each BLV 21-bp repeat contains a cAMP response element (CRE) in the center and unique 5&#39; and 3&#39; neighboring sequences which are crucial for the transcriptional activation by BLV Tax. Here we describe the interactions of recombinant BLV Tax with cellular bZip proteins. The recombinant BLV Tax, tagged at the carboxy terminus with a hexahistidine extension, was prepared by solubilization in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and renaturation on the Ni(2+)-chelating Sepharose gel matrix. The renatured BLV TaxH6 activates the BLV LTR when introduced into HeLa cells by scrape loading. Furthermore, the purified BLV TaxH6 enhances binding of members of the CREB/ATF family of bZip proteins to CRE motifs by interacting with their bZip domains in vitro. Chemical cross-linking indicates that dimerization of bZip proteins such as CREB becomes greatly facilitated in the presence of BLV Tax. These results suggest that BLV Tax interacts directly with CREB/ATF-like factors to activate viral mRNA transcription.	1995 Dec	Boros I M,Tie F,Giam C Z	Virology. 214(1) 207-14	Tax	ASVVGWGPHSLHACPALVLSNDDTIDAWCPLCGPHERLQFERIDTTLTCETHHITWTADGRPFGLNGALFPRLHVSETRPQGPRRLWINCPLPAVRAQPGPVSLPPLEQSPFQPYQCQLPSASSDGSPIIGHGLLPWNNLVTHPVLGKVLILNQMANFSLLPSFDTLIVDPLRLSVFAPDTRGTIRYLSTLLTLCPATCILPLDEPFSPNVPICRFPRDSNEPPLSEFELPLIQTPGLSWSVPAIDLFLTGPPSPNDRLHVWSSPQALQRFLHDPTLTWSELVASRKLKLDSPLKLQLLENEWLSPALFHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q5MNW3			7.9	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
11846809	Domain organization, folding and stability of bacteriophage T4 fibritin, a segmented coiled-coil protein.	Fibritin is a segmented coiled-coil homotrimer of the 486-residue product of phage T4 gene wac. This protein attaches to a phage particle by the N-terminal region and forms fibrous whiskers of 530 A, which perform a chaperone function during virus assembly. The short C-terminal region has a beta-annulus-like structure. We engineered a set of fibritin deletion mutants sequentially truncated from the N-termini, and the mutants were studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and CD measurements. The analysis of DSC curves indicates that full-length fibritin exhibits three thermal-heat-absorption peaks centred at 321 K (Delta H=1390 kJ x mol trimer(-1)), at 336 K (Delta H=7600 kJ x mol trimer(-1)), and at 345 K (Delta H=515 kJ x mol trimer(-1)). These transitions were assigned to the N-terminal, segmented coiled-coil, and C-terminal functional domains, respectively. The coiled-coil region, containing 13 segments, melts co-operatively as a single domain with a mean enthalpy Delta Hres=21 kJ x mol residue(-1). The ratio of Delta HVH/Delta Hcal for the coiled-coil part of the 120-, 182-, 258- and 281-residue per monomer mutants, truncated from the N-termini, and for full-length fibritin are 0.91, 0.88, 0.42, 0.39, and 0.13, respectively. This gives an indication of the decrease of the &#39;all-or-none&#39; character of the transition with increasing protein size. The deletion of the 12-residue-long loop in the 120-residue fibritin increases the thermal stability of the coiled-coil region. According to CD data, full-length fibritin and all the mutants truncated from the N-termini refold properly after heat denaturation. In contrast, fibritin XN, which is deleted for the C-terminal domain, forms aggregates inside the cell. The XN protein can be partially refolded by dilution from urea and does not refold after heat denaturation. These results confirm that the C-terminal domain is essential for correct fibritin assembly both in vivo and in vitro and acts as a foldon.	2002 Feb	Boudko Sergei P,Londer Yuri Y,Letarov Andrei V,Sernova Natalia V,Engel Juergen,Mesyanzhinov Vadim V	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 269(3) 833-41	Fibritin	TDIVLNDLPFVDGPPAEGQSRISWIKNGEEILGADTQYGSEGSMNRPTVSVLRNVEVLDKNIGILKTSLETANSDIKTIQGILDVSGDIEALAQIGINKKDISDLKTLTSEHTEILNGTNNTVDSILADIGPFNAEANSVYRTIRNDLLWIKRELGQYTGQDINGLPVVGNPSSGMKHRIINNTDVITSQGIRLSELETKFIESDVGSLTIEVGNLREELGPKPPSFSQNVYSRLNEIDTKQTTVESDISAIKTSIGYPGNNSIITSVNTNTDNIASINLELNQSGGIKQRLTVIETSIGSDDIPSSIKGQIKDNTTSIESLNGIVGENTSSGLRANVSWLNQIVGTDSSGGQPSPPGSLLNRVSTIETSVSGLNNAVQNLQVEIGNNSAGIKGQVVALNTLVNGTNPNGSTVEERGLTNSIKANETNIASVTQEVNTAKGNISSLQGDVQALQEAGDPAANKARKEAELAAATAEQ	C-terminal sequence	P10104			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
15784566	Function of neisserial outer membrane phospholipase a in autolysis and assessment of its vaccine potential.	Outer membrane phospholipase A (OMPLA) is an outer membrane-localized enzyme, present in many gram-negative bacterial species. It is implicated in the virulence of several pathogens. Here, we investigated the presence, function, and vaccine potential of OMPLA in the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. Immunoblot analysis showed the presence of OMPLA in 28 out of 33 meningococcal strains investigated. The OMPLA-negative strains all contained a pldA gene, but these alleles contained premature stop codons. All six Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains tested, but only two out of seven commensal neisserial strains investigated, expressed OMPLA, showing that OMPLA is expressed by, but not limited to, many pathogenic neisserial strains. The function of OMPLA was investigated by assessing the phenotypes of isogenic strains, expressing no OMPLA, expressing wild-type levels of OMPLA, or overexpressing OMPLA. OMPLA exhibited phospholipase activity against endogenous phospholipids. Furthermore, OMPLA was characterized as an autolysin that acted under specific conditions, such as prolonged growth of the bacteria. The vaccine potential of the protein was investigated by immunizing mice with in vitro refolded, recombinant OMPLA. High levels of antibody titers were obtained, but the murine sera were neither bactericidal nor protective. Also, convalescent patients and vaccinee sera did not contain detectable levels of anti-OMPLA antibodies, indicating that OMPLA may not be sufficiently immunogenic to be included in a meningococcal vaccine.	2005 Apr	Bos Martine P,Tefsen Boris,Voet Pierre,Weynants Vincent,van Putten Jos P M,Tommassen Jan	Infection and immunity. 73(4) 2222-31	Outer Membrane Phospholipase A	FGETALQCAALTDNVTRLVCYDRIFAAQLPSSAGQEGQESKAVLNLTETVRSSLDKGEAVIVVEKGGDALPADSAGETADIYTPLSLMYDLDKNDLRGLLGVREHNPMYLMPLWYNNSPNYAPSSPTRGTTVQEKFGQQKRAETKLQVSFKSKIAEDLFKTRADLWFGYTQRSDWQIYNQGRKSAPFRNTDYKPEIFLTQPVKADLPFGGRLRMLGAGFVHQSNGQSRPESRSWNRIYAMAGMEWGKLTVIPRVWVRAFDQSGDKNDNPDIADYMGYGDVKLQYRLNDRQNVYSVLRYNPKTGYGAIEAAYTFPIKGKLKGVVRGFHGYGESLIDYNHKQNGIGIGLMFQDLDGI		Q6DN70			10.8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12220628	Identification of a dominant self-ligand bound to three HLA B44 alleles and the preliminary crystallographic analysis of recombinant forms of each complex.	A naturally processed and presented ligand that is shared by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*4402, B*4403 and B*4405 molecules has been identified in peptides isolated from immunoaffinity purified HLA B44 complexes. This peptide derived from HLA DPalpha residues 46-54, an endogenous product of HLA DP expressed in the cell line Hmy2.C1R, is a prominent peptide in the mass spectra of species isolated as bound peptides from each allele when the three HLA B44 subtypes were introduced as transfected gene products. Recombinant truncated forms of HLA B*4405(1-276), HLA B*4403(1-276), HLA B*4402(1-276) and beta(2)-microglobulin have been prepared as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and refolded in the presence of the DPalpha(46-54) peptide and purified by a combination of size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography. This material was determined to be correctly folded based on detection of a conformational epitope recognized by the W6/32 monoclonal antibody. Large, plate-like crystals of the three complexes were produced using polyethylene glycol as the precipitant. All the crystals belong to the space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell dimensions of approximately a=51, b=82, c=110 A. The crystals of three B44/DPalpha complexes diffracted to a resolution of 1.9 A or better. For the first time, using this natural, high abundance ligand of the HLA B44 molecules we have successfully expressed and refolded the three HLA B44 molecules and produced crystals amenable to structural studies.	2002 Sep	Macdonald Whitney,Williams David S,Clements Craig S,Gorman Jeffery J,Kjer-Nielsen Lars,Brooks Andrew G,McCluskey James,Rossjohn Jamie,Purcell Anthony W	FEBS letters. 527(1-3) 27-32	HLA class I histocompatibility antigen B	GSHSMRYFYTAMSRPGRGEPRFITVGYVDDTLFVRFDSDATSPRKEPRAPWIEQEGPEYWDRETQISKTNTQTYRENLRTALRYYNQSEAGSHIIQRMYGCDVGPDGRLLRGYDQDAYDGKDYIALNEDLSSWTAADTAAQITQRKWEAARVAEQLRAYLEGLCVESLRRYLENGKETLQRADPPKTHVTHHPISDHEVTLRCWALGFYPAEITLTWQRDGEDQTQDTELVETRPAGDRTFQKWAAVVVPSGEEQRYTCHVQHEGLPKPLTLRWEP		P30481		Extracellular domain (aa.1-276) of mature protein	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t

Large, plate-like crystals of the three complexes were produced using polyethylene glycol as the precipitant.

12220628	Identification of a dominant self-ligand bound to three HLA B44 alleles and the preliminary crystallographic analysis of recombinant forms of each complex.	A naturally processed and presented ligand that is shared by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*4402, B*4403 and B*4405 molecules has been identified in peptides isolated from immunoaffinity purified HLA B44 complexes. This peptide derived from HLA DPalpha residues 46-54, an endogenous product of HLA DP expressed in the cell line Hmy2.C1R, is a prominent peptide in the mass spectra of species isolated as bound peptides from each allele when the three HLA B44 subtypes were introduced as transfected gene products. Recombinant truncated forms of HLA B*4405(1-276), HLA B*4403(1-276), HLA B*4402(1-276) and beta(2)-microglobulin have been prepared as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and refolded in the presence of the DPalpha(46-54) peptide and purified by a combination of size exclusion and anion exchange chromatography.

10833387	Preparation of recombinant bovine, porcine, and porcine W4R/R5K leptins and comparison of their activity and immunoreactivity with ovine, chicken, and human leptins.	Recombinant ovine Ala-leptin (GenBank Accession No. U84247, of ovine leptin), previously prepared in our laboratory in prokaryotic expression plasmid pMON3401, was mutated using a mutagenesis kit to prepare plasmids encoding for bovine (GenBank Accession No. U50365) and porcine (GenBank Accession No. U59894) leptins and for porcine leptin analogue W4R/R5K. Escherichia coli cells transformed with these plasmids overexpressed large amounts of these proteins upon induction with nalidixic acid. The expressed proteins, found in inclusion bodies, were refolded and purified to homogeneity using subsequently anion- and cation-exchange chromatography. All three purified proteins showed a single band of the expected molecular mass of 16 kDa in SDS-PAGE in the presence of reducing agent and were composed of 90-100% monomers. Proper refolding was evidenced by comparing their CD spectra to those of previously prepared chicken and ovine leptins and to commercially available human leptin. The amino acid content of the purified proteins closely resembled the predicted composition. The biological activity of bovine leptin, porcine leptin, and porcine leptin analogue W4R/R5K was evidenced by their ability to stimulate proliferation of leptin-sensitive BAF/3 cells transfected with a long form of human leptin receptor. All three proteins, as well as ovine and chicken leptins, but not human leptin, exhibited a very high degree of cross-immunoreactivity against antiserum raised against ovine leptin in rabbits. In contrast, none or very low cross-immunoreactivity was observed against antiserum raised against ovine leptin in goats.	2000 Jun	Raver N,Gussakovsky E E,Keisler D H,Krishna R,Mistry J,Gertler A	Protein expression and purification. 19(1) 30-40	Leptin	AVPIWRVQDDTKTLIKTIVTRISDISHMQSVSSKQRVTGLDFIPGLHPVLSLSKMDQTLAIYQQILTSLPSRNVIQISNDLENLRDLLHLLASSKSCPLPQARALETLESLGGVLEASLYSTEVVALSRLQGALQDMLRQLDLSPGC		Q29406			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f

10686155	Reconstitution of bacterial expressed human CD94: the importance of the stem region for dimer formation.	Human CD94 is a subunit of the disulfide-linked, heterodimeric natural killer (NK) cell surface receptor CD94/NKG2. This receptor, a member of the C-type lectin superfamily, participates in regulating NK cell directed lysis through interaction with the major histocompatibility antigen HLA-E. Two forms of CD94 were expressed using a bacterial expression system and refolded in vitro. One form, residues 34-179, designated S34, corresponds to the entire extracellular region of the receptor, including a 23-residue stem region, and the other, residues 51-179, designated E51, corresponds only to the putative carbohydrate recognition domain of the receptor. The refolded full-length S34 protein existed as a noncovalent dimer initially but formed an interchain disulfide bond upon storage for several months. In contrast, the stemless construct, E51, existed largely as a monomeric form. The stem region of S34, residues 34-56, is sensitive to proteolysis and its absence results in dissociation of the dimer. This suggests that the residues in the stem region of CD94 help to stabilize the dimeric conformation.	2000 Mar	Boyington J C,Raiz A N,Brooks A G,Patamawenu A,Sun P D	Protein expression and purification. 18(2) 235-41	Natural killer cells antigen CD94	MHHHHHHSSGLVPAGSGMKETAAAKPERQHMDSPDLGTDDDDKAMADIGELQKDSDCCSCQEKWVGYRCNCYFISSEQKTWNESRHLCASQKSSLLQLQNTDELDFMSSSQQFYWIGLSYSEEHTAWLWENGSALSQYLFPSFETFNTKNCIAYNPNGNALDESCEDKNRYICKQQLI	N-terminal hexahis + pro seq	Q13241		Extracellular Domain (51-279)	8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

11944966	Comparison of R128Q mutations in human, ovine, and chicken leptins.	Human leptin and its R128Q mutant, as well as the R128Q mutants of ovine and chicken leptins, were prepared, expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified to homogeneity yielding electrophoretically pure, over 95% monomeric protein. R128Q mutations did not change the binding properties to BAF/3 cells stably transfected with the long form of human leptin receptor compared, respectively, to non-mutated human, ovine, and chicken leptins. In contrast, the biological activity tested in a proliferation assay in the same cells was drastically changed. Human leptin R128Q lost its activity and even became a weak antagonist, whereas the activities of ovine and chicken leptins were reduced 25- and 80-fold. If dimerization models were applicable leptin receptor activation, the present results would suggest that site 2 of the hormone was impaired. Two models, the human growth hormone:human growth hormone receptor (hGH:hGHR) (1:2) and the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor:granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor (GCSF:GCSFR) (2:2) complexes, were used for modeling. Superimposing the leptin structure on the hGH and GCSF models in the complex structures did not indicate any role for R128 in receptor binding. This made it impossible to correlate the results shown in the present work with the currently available models. Therefore, leptin may bind its receptors in a manner different than those proposed until now.	2002 Mar	Raver Nina,Vardy Eyal,Livnah Oded,Devos Rene,Gertler Arieh	General and comparative endocrinology. 126(1) 52-8	Leptin	VPCQIFQDDTKTLIKTIVTRINDISHTSVSAKQRVTGLDFIPGLHPILSLSKMDQTLAVYQQVLTSLPSQNVLQIANDLENLRDLLHLLAFSKSCSLPQTSGLQKPESLDGVLEASLYSTEVVALSQLQGSLQDILQQLDISPEC		O42164			9	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

15139278	Production and biochemical characterization of the recombinant Boophilus microplus Bm95 antigen from Pichia pastoris.	The new antigen Bm95 from the cattle tick Boophilus microplus was recently isolated, cloned and expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein has shown to induce protection in cattle against infestations of B. microplus under controlled and production conditions. In this paper we report the production and large-scale purification of the Bm95 protein, following a simple and cost-effective process. The antigen was obtained highly aggregated, forming particles ranging from 26 to 30 nm and with purity higher than 80%. The process yield was 0.55 g of pure Bm95 protein per liter of culture. The 980f the primary structure of the recombinant protein was verified by mass spectrometry. Three amino acid changes in comparison with the sequence deduced from cDNA were detected by LC-MS/MS. The antigen was also obtained N-glycosylated, as previously reported for heterologous protein expression in P. pastoris.	2004 	Boué O,Farnós O,González A,Fernández R,Acosta J A,Valdés R,González L J,Guanche Y,Izquierdo G,Suárez M,Domínguez I,Machado H,Rodríguez M,Lleonart R	Experimental &amp; applied acarology. 32(1-2) 119-28	Bm95 protein	ESSICSDFGNEFCRNAECEVVPGAEDDFVCKCPRDNMYFNAAEKQCEYKDTCKTRECSYGRCVESNPSKGSCVCERSDDLTLQCKIKNDYATDCRNRGGTAKLRTDGFIGATCDCGEWGAMNKTTRNCVPTTCLRPDLTCKDLCEKNLLQRDSRCCQGWNTANCSAAPPADSYCSPGSPKGPDGQCKNACRTKEAGFVCKHGCRSTDKAYECTCPSGSTVAEDGITCKSISYTVSCTVEQKQTCRPTEDCRVQKGTVLCECPWNQHLVGDTCISDCVDKKCHEEFMDCGVYMNRQSCYCPWKSRKPGPNVNINERLLNEYYYTVSFTPNISFDSDHCKRYEDRVLGAIRTSIGKEVFKVEILNCTQDIKARLIAEKPLSKYVLRKLQACEHPIGEWCMMYPKLLIKKNSATEIEEENLCDSLLKNQEAAYKGQNKCVKVDNLFWFQCADGYTTTYEMTRGRLRRSVCKAGVSCNENEQLECANKGQICVYENGKANCQCPPDTKPGEIGCIERTTCNPKEIQECQDKKLECVYKNHKAECKCPDDHECSR	Details on plasmid were not provided.

12535530	The response regulator BvgA and RNA polymerase alpha subunit C-terminal domain bind simultaneously to different faces of the same segment of promoter DNA.	Examination of the binding of FeBABE-conjugated BvgA to the fha promoter of Bordetella pertussis has revealed that three dimers, formed by head-to-head association of monomers, bind one face of the DNA helix from the inverted-heptad primary binding site to the -35 region. The orientation of BvgA monomers within the dimers is the same as that recently demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic methods for a dimer of the C-terminal domain of NarL bound to DNA. Use of FeBABE conjugates of RNAP alpha subunit C-terminal domain showed that binding of this domain is linearly coincident with binding of the BvgA dimers, but to a different helical face.

These results reveal a previously undescribed mode of interaction between RNAP alpha-CTD and a transcriptional activator.	2003 Jan	Boucher Philip E,Maris Ann E,Yang Mei-Shin,Stibitz Scott	Molecular cell. 11(1) 163-73	Virulence factors putative positive transcription regulator bvgA	MYNKVLIIDDHPVLRFAVRVLMEKEGFEVIGETDNGIDGLKIAREKIPNLVVLDIGIPKLDGLEVIARLQSLGLPLRVLVLTGQPPSLFARRCLNSGAAGFVCKHENLHEVINAAKAVMAGYTYFPSTTLSEMRMGDNAKSDSTLISVLSNRELTVLQLLAQGMSNKDIADSMFLSNKTVSTYKTRLLQKLNACSLVELIDLAKRNNLA		P0A4H2			7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11713311	Overexpression, purification and characterization of RecJ protein from Thermus thermophilus HB8 and its core domain.	A recJ homolog was cloned from the extremely thermophilic bacterium Thermus themophilus HB8. It encodes a 527 amino acid protein that has 33 0dentity to Escherichia coli RecJ protein and includes the characteristic motifs conserved among RecJ homologs. Although T.thermophilus RecJ protein (ttRecJ) was expressed as an inclusion body, it was purified in soluble form through denaturation with urea and subsequent refolding steps. Limited proteolysis showed that ttRecJ has a protease-resistant core domain, which includes all the conserved motifs. We constructed a truncated ttRecJ gene that corresponds to the core domain (cd-ttRecJ). cd-ttRecJ was overexpressed in soluble form and purified. ttRecJ and cd-ttRecJ were stable up to 60 degrees C. Size exclusion chromatography indicated that ttRecJ exists in several oligomeric states, whereas cd-ttRecJ is monomeric in solution. Both proteins have 5&#39;--&gt;3&#39; exonuclease activity, which was enhanced by increasing the temperature to 50 degrees C. Mg(2+), Mn(2+) or Co(2+) ions were required to activate both proteins, whereas Ca(2+) and Zn(2+) had no effects.	2001 Nov	Yamagata A,Masui R,Kakuta Y,Kuramitsu S,Fukuyama K	Nucleic acids research. 29(22) 4617-24	RecJ Single-stranded DNA specific exonuclease	MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIDDDDLHMRDRVRWRVLSLPPLAQWREVMAALEVGPEAALAYWHRGFRRKEDLDPPLALLPLKGLREAAALLEEALRQGKRIRVHGDYDADGLTGTAILVRGLAALGADVHPFIPHRLEEGYGVLMERVPEHLEASDLFLTVDCGITNHAELRELLENGVEVIVTDHHTPGKTPSPGLVVHPALTPDLKEKPTGAGVVFLLLWALHERLGLPPPLEYADLAAVGTIADVAPLWGWNRALVKEGLARIPASSWVGLRLLAEAVGYTGKAVEVAFRIAPRINAASRLGEAEKALRLLLTDDAAEAQALVGELHRLNARRQTLEEAMLRKLLPQADPEAKAIVLLDPEGHPGVMGIVASRILEATLRPVFLVAQGKGTVRSLAPISAVEALRSAEDLLLRYGGHKEAAGFAMDEALFPAFKARVEAYAARFPDPVREVALLDLLPEPGLLPQVFRELALLEPYGEGNPEPLFLLFGAPEEARRLGEGRHLAFRLKGVRVLAWKQGDLALPPEVEVAGLLSENAWNGHLAYEVQAVDL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q93R48			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
10548490	In vitro heat effect on functional and conformational changes of cyclodextrin glucanotransferase from hyperthermophilic archaea.	The in vitro heat effect on protein characteristics of thermostable enzyme was examined using a cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase, EC 2.4.1.19) from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus sp. B1001 as a model protein. The recombinant form of CGTase was obtained as an inclusion body from Escherichia coli cells harboring a plasmid which carried the B1001 CGTase gene (cgtA). CGTase was solubilized by 6 M urea, refolded, purified to homogeneity, and heat treated at 80 degrees C for 20 min. Enzyme characteristics were examined compared with those of unheated CGTase. Cyclization activity was increased by in vitro heat treatment, while hydrolysis activity was decreased. The heated and unheated CGTases were analyzed for structures by circular dichroism (CD). The near- and far-UV CD spectra indicated that the structure of unheated CGTase with low cyclization activity was different from that of heated CGTase with high activity. Differential scanning calorimetry of unheated CGTase showed two absorption peaks at 87 and 106 degrees C with increasing temperature. After heat treatment, the minor peak at 87 degrees C disappeared, suggesting that heat-dependent structural conversion occurred in CGTase. These results indicate that the thermal environment plays an important role for the protein folding process of thermostable CGTase.	1999 Nov	Yamamoto T,Shiraki K,Fujiwara S,Takagi M,Fukui K,Imanaka T	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 265(1) 57-61	Cyclodextrin glucanotransferase	MRSRKIYMLVVLLLFLGFSEQISTVAAGVSPSYPAGDPQTWVIYQIVIDRFYDGNTSNNDPLKSPGLYDPNKENWKLYWGGDLEGIIAKLPYLYELGVSAIWISPVFDNIDVPINGSNGLEAGYHGYWPKDFKVIEEHFGTWEIFRRLSQEAAKYNITIIIDFVPNHSNPNDAGEYGALYDNGTFVIDYPTDANYATVHPITKSLSYIYNHNGGITNWNDRWEVRYKNLFNLADLNQLNPWVDNYLKESTVSYLEAGIGGIRIDAVKHLEPGWLKTYADYVYARKNVFMFGEWYQGFNDEMYWDMVKFANYTGIGLINIPLQQVLVDVFAYDTKTMWDLESAVNKYTIDFMWQNKLTIFVDSHDVPRFLSLRNDLIRFHQALAFVLTAPGIPIIYYGDEQYLHNDTVNDFGQVGGDPYNRPMMKTWNTSTTAFKLIKTLASLRRYNPALAYGLIATRYVSDDIYIFERKFFDNVVLVAINRNLNSPYVVSNVYTSLPDGSYNDYLGGLLNGVGITVSSGTFSVELPAGSVSVWQYKATPTDPWVGAIDPVMGRAGNIVTVSGEGFGDVPGRVLITNGQDYWTAEVTYWSDKSVEFIVPSGITTQLNENHVEVRIERADGATSNGIAFEYLTNKQIPAIFEVRNTQGTNLETQVGEFLWLTGSVPELSYWSPETIKAVGPMLCPGWPDWFVVASVPADTYIEFKFLKAPLGGTGIWEVGSNHAYLTPSSGIGEVSVEANR		Q9UWN2			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
12535530	The response regulator BvgA and RNA polymerase alpha subunit C-terminal domain bind simultaneously to different faces of the same segment of promoter DNA.	Examination of the binding of FeBABE-conjugated BvgA to the fha promoter of Bordetella pertussis has revealed that three dimers, formed by head-to-head association of monomers, bind one face of the DNA helix from the inverted-heptad primary binding site to the -35 region. The orientation of BvgA monomers within the dimers is the same as that recently demonstrated by X-ray crystallographic methods for a dimer of the C-terminal domain of NarL bound to DNA.

9045838	Nature of DNA binding and RNA polymerase interaction of the Bordetella pertussis BvgA transcriptional activator at the fha promoter.	The expression of virulence factor genes in Bordetella pertussis is mediated by the BvgA-BvgS two-component signal transduction system. The response regulator, BvgA, acts directly as a transcriptional activator at the loci encoding pertussis toxin (ptx) and filamentous hemagglutinin (fha). Previous studies have demonstrated that these two loci are differentially regulated by BvgA. As an initial step in gaining insight into the mechanism underlying this differential regulation, we initiated DNA binding and in vitro transcription analyses to examine the activities of BvgA and RNA polymerase (RNAP) purified from both B. pertussis and Escherichia coli at the fha promoter. We discovered that unphosphorylated BvgA binds to a single region (-100 to -70, relative to the start of transcription), whereas phosphorylated BvgA binds both this region and another, farther downstream, that extends to the -35 nucleotide. In the absence of BvgA, RNAP binds a region farther upstream than expected (-104 to -35). However, occupation of both sites by BvgA phosphate repositions RNAP to the site used in vivo. The binding of BvgA phosphate to the downstream site correlates with in vitro transcriptional activity at the fha promoter. As the DNA binding and transcription activities of the E. coli-derived RNAP are similar to those observed for the B. pertussis enzyme, we employed several mutant E. coli proteins in in vitro transcription analyses. We observed that polymerases carrying either a deletion of the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit or substitution of alanine at either of two critical residues within this domain were severely impaired in the ability to mediate BvgA-activated transcription at fha.	1997 Mar	Boucher P E,Murakami K,Ishihama A,Stibitz S	Journal of bacteriology. 179(5) 1755-63	RNA polymerase	MSTQGFLKPRSIEVEPVGAHHAKIVMEPFERGYGHTLGNALRRILLSSMTGYAPTEVQMTGVVHEYSTIAGVREDVVDILLNLKGVVFKLHNRDEVTLVLRKNGAGAVVASDIELPHDVEIINPDHLICNLTDAGKIEMQVKVEKGRGYVPGNVRALSEDRTHTIGRIVLDASFSPVRRVSYAVESARVEQRTDLDKLVLDIETNGVISPEEAVRQAARILMDQISVFAALEGAGDAYEPPVRGTPQIDPVLLRPVDDLELTVRSANCLKAENIYYIGDLIQRTENELLKTPNLGRKSLNEIKEVLAARGLTLGMKLENWPPLGLERP		P0A4E5		Alpha Chain	7.9	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10536045	Proregion of Bombyx mori cysteine proteinase functions as an intramolecular chaperone to promote proper folding of the mature enzyme.	A cDNA encoding the proform of Bombyx cysteine proteinase (BCP) was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli using the T7 polymerase expression system. The insoluble recombinant zymogen was solubilized and renatured by modifying a method applied to human pro-cathepsin L. Like the natural BCP precursor, the recombinant proenzyme was spontaneously converted to an active proteinase at pH 3.75. A deletion in the central region of the propeptide resulted in much loss of the activity, suggesting that the propeptide is essential for proper folding during renaturation. In contrast, the renatured mature form of recombinant BCP was not active but regained activity by including the propeptide in the renaturing buffer, suggesting that the propeptide, acting as an intramolecular chaperone, promotes refolding of the associated proteinase domain into an active conformation. The mature form of natural BCP rapidly lost its activity at neutral pH, whereas its proform was stable. The mature enzyme retained some activity in the presence of the propeptide.

12076632	Characterisation and expression of the Fasciola gigantica cathepsin L gene.	The gene structure of a cathepsin L from Fasciola gigantica was characterised. The gene spans approximately 2.0 kb and comprises four exons and three introns and is a compact gene as in the cases of crustaceous and platyhelminth cathepsins L. Southern blot analysis suggested that a few copies of the genes are sparsely organised in the genome. Of the three intron insertion positions, two of which are in the same position as in the mammalian cathepsin L gene. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that F. gigantica cathepsin L forms a clade with those from Fasciola hepatica, but not with those from Spirometra erinacei and schistosomes. Putative TATA-boxes were found upstream of a transcription initiation site. The sequence analysis of the 5&#39;-upstream of the transcript revealed that the cathepsin L gene is transcribed by cis-splicing fashion. Furthermore, the experiments using recombinant F. gigantica procathepsin L showed that it was processed to an enzymatically active cathepsin L by pH-dependent autocatalysis. However, the pro-peptide deleted cathepsin L showed no enzyme activity, indicating that the pro-region of F. gigantica procathepsin L is essential for the folding and/or refolding of functional cathepsin L. These results are consistent with the observations in mammalian cathepsin L and papain.	2002 Jul	Yamasaki Hiroshi,Mineki Reiko,Murayama Kimie,Ito Akira,Aoki Takashi	International journal for parasitology. 32(8) 1031-42	Cathepsin L	MSPILGYWKIKGLVQPTRLLLEYLEEKYEEHLYERDEGDKWRNKKFELGLEFPNLPYYIDGDVKLTQSMAIIRYIADKHNMLGGCPKERAEISMLEGAVLDIRYGVSRIAYSKDFETLKVDFLSKLPEMLKMFEDRLCHKTYLNGDHVTHPDFMLYDALDVVLYMDPMCLDAFPKLVCFKKRIEAIPQIDKYLKSSKYIAWPLQGWQATFGGGDHPPKSDLVPRGSSNDDLWHQWKRMYNKEYNGAVDEHRRNIWEDNVKHIQEHNLRHDVGLVTYTLGLNQLTDMTFEEFKAKYLTEMPRASDILSHGIPYEANNRAVPDKIDWRGSGYVTTVKDQGNCGSCWAFSTTGTMEGQYMKNERTSISFSEQQLVDCSGPWGNYGCSGGLMENAYEYLKQFGLETESSYPYTAVEGQCRYNRQLGVAKVTDYYTVHSGSEVELKNLVGAEGPAAIAVDVESDFMMYSGGIYQSQTCLRLNHAVLAVGYGTQGGTDYWIVKNSWGLSWGERGYIRMARNRGNMCGISSLASLPMVARFP	GST fusion protein: full length protein without signal (pre) sequence,N-terminal GST + pro-sequence	Q8T0X0			10.7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14593111	Conserved high affinity ligand binding and membrane association in the native and refolded extracellular domain of the human glycine receptor alpha1-subunit.	The strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor (GlyR) is a ligand-gated chloride channel composed of ligand binding alpha- and gephyrin anchoring beta-subunits. To identify the secondary and quaternary structures of extramembraneous receptor domains, the N-terminal extracellular domain (alpha1-(1-219)) and the large intracellular TM3-4 loop (alpha1-(309-392)) of the human GlyR alpha1-subunit were individually expressed in HEK293 cells and in Escherichia coli. The extracellular domain obtained from E. coli expression was purified in its denatured form and refolding conditions were established. Circular dichroism and Fourier-transform-infrared spectroscopy suggested approximately 25% alpha-helix and approximately 480eta-sheet for the extracellular domain, while no alpha-helices were detectable for the TM3-4 loop. Size exclusion chromatography and sucrose density centrifugation indicated that isolated glycine receptor domains assembled into multimers of distinct molecular weight. For the extracellular domain from E. coli, we found an apparent molecular weight compatible with a 15mer by gel filtration. The N-terminal domain from HEK293 cells, analyzed by sucrose gradient centrifugation, showed a bimodal distribution, suggesting oligomerization of approximately 5 and 15 subunits. Likewise, for the intracellular domain from E. coli, a single molecular mass peak of approximately 49 kDa indicated oligomerization in a defined native structure. As shown by [(3)H]strychnine binding, expression in HEK293 cells and refolding of the isolated extracellular domain reconstituted high affinity antagonist binding. Cell fractionation, alkaline extraction experiments, and immunocytochemistry showed a tight plasma membrane association of the isolated GlyR N-terminal protein. These findings indicate that distinct functional characteristics of the full-length GlyR are retained in the isolated N-terminal domain.	2004 Jan	Breitinger Ulrike,Breitinger Hans-Georg,Bauer Finn,Fahmy Karim,Glockenhammer Daniela,Becker Cord-Michael	The Journal of biological chemistry. 279(3) 1627-36	Glycine receptor alpha-1 chain precursor	MHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSGMKETAAAKPGRQHMDSPDLARSATKPMSPSDFLDKLMGRTSGYDARIRPNFKGPPVNVSCNIFINSFGSIAETTMDYRVNIFLRQQWNDPRLAYNEYPDDSLDLDPSMLDSIWKPDLFFANEKGAHFHEITTDNKLLRISRNGNVLYSIRITLTLACPMDLKNFPMDVQTCIMQLESFGYTMNDLIFEWQEQGAVQVADGLTLPQFILKEEKDLRYCTKHYNTGKFTCIEARFHLERQM	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P23415		Extracellular domain (29-248)	8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t

15946799	Characterization of a novel vaccine candidate and serine proteinase inhibitor from Schistosoma japonicum (Sj serpin).	Serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins) represent an important superfamily of endogenous inhibitors that regulate proteolytic events active in a variety of physiological functions. Immunological screening of a Schistosoma japonicum adult worm cDNA expression library with sera of Microtus fortis, a naturally resistant vertebrate host, has identified one clone that encoded for a sequence homologous to those of the serpin superfamily. The full-length sequence encoding S. japonicum serpin (Sj serpin) was amplified from adult worm cDNA by using 5&#39;-RACE-PCR and subsequently cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET28c. The full-length Sj serpin fusion-protein with his-tag was expressed in E. coli, purified by affinity chromatography and used to immunize New Zealand white rabbits. Sj serpin is located on the tegument in S. japonicum adult worms. C57BL/6 mice immunized with Sj serpin induced the production of high levels of specific IgE and IgG1 subclass antibodies as well as a marked IL-4 response. Lymphocyte surface marker analysis revealed proliferation of CD19 expressing B cells, indicating a predominant Th2-type response to Sj serpin. Immunized mice developed moderate protection against infection of S. japonicum as demonstrated by a 36 and 39% reduction in the recovery of adult worms and eggs, respectively. These data suggested a role for Sj serpin as a vaccine candidate or as a novel target for anti-schistosome drugs.	2005 Jul	Yan Yutao,Liu Shuxian,Song Guangcheng,Xu Yixin,Dissous Colette	Veterinary parasitology. 131(1-2) 53-60	Sj Serpin	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMAPKVQDPYANNPSHKAFTRAFLSQSTVDFGEDNFLASPLGVLFTLGILLGSGGAQGKTSYQIAKTMRLKSANFPWNISETQQEMKSLYKELSDSLTMENTTLDGNEVKVVRISTGVFTQETYDVESNFNKSIQNDFGGELLTVDFTNQTNAAQDINKWVNEHSNGLVEEFFTDDIPKDAWMILINIFYFRDYWENPFVPYYTSLENFSVTNNHHLQVPMMSKDEILKYKKFPEDGFEIVSKPMKNTRFSFIILLPLEKWNLNGAIEVLNGNKILSHYVDKLEETSVSLKMPKFTLTKKLQLVGTLKSIGIKNLFDPLKADLSGISSKNNLYVNSFIQTNVMKVNESGIEEASVTSPIIVPISALIPDVNFHVTHPFICFIYDQQLTMPLLAAKVINPMLRAPPPPPLRSGC	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q967L9			7.4	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9126605	Construction and overexpression of a synthetic gene for human DNA methylguanine methyltransferase: renaturation and rapid purification of the protein.	A synthetic gene was constructed that encodes human DNA methylguanine methyltransferase (hMGMT). The synthetic gene was designed with a number of unique restriction sites to facilitate cassette mutagenesis and to reflect the preferences found among genes in Escherichia coli. Both the full-length gene and a gene for a functional variant (hMGMT delta C) that lacks the C-terminal 28 codons were constructed, and the genes were overexpressed using a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The proteins are made in the form of insoluble aggregates but the truncated form of the protein (hMGMT delta C) has been successfully denatured, renatured, and purified to near homogeneity by ion exchange. Methyltransferase activity assays of hMGMT delta C demonstrate that the reconstituted protein has substantial DNA repair activity, though somewhat less than full-length hMGMT that had been expressed and purified in a soluble form. Mass spectrometry of a mixture of proteolytic fragments confirmed the protein sequence and indicated no detectable oxidation of the active site cysteine. The protein was determined to be monomeric by gel filtration chromatography, and circular dichroism spectra for renatured hMGMT delta C and fully soluble hMGMT are consistent with the renatured protein preparation being fully folded. Refolded hMGMT delta C had a curious propensity to form large aggregates in a time-dependent manner when injected into a dynamic light scattering instrument; this aggregation behavior was not observed for hMGMT purified in a soluble form. Differences in susceptibility to aggregation may account for differences in methyltransfer activity. Yields of purified protein were approximately 5 mg/liter of culture.	1997 Apr	Brown L R,Deng J,Noll D M,Mori N,Clarke N D	Protein expression and purification. 9(3) 337-45	DNA methylguanine methyltransferase	MDKDCEMKRTTLDSPLGKLELSGCEQGLHEIKLLGKGTSAADAVEVPAPAAVLGGPEPLMQCTAWLNAYFHQPEAIEEFPVPALHHPVFQQESFTRQVLWKLLKVVKFGEVISYQQLAALAGNPKAARAVGGAMRGNPVPILIPCHRVVCSSGAVGNYSGGLAVKEWLLAHEGHRLGKP	Composed of residues 1-179 of original sequence	P16455			9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12962509	Coupled kinetics of ATP and peptide hydrolysis by Escherichia coli FtsH protease.	FtsH from Escherichia coli is an ATP- and Zn(2+)-dependent integral membrane protease that is involved in the degradation of regulatory proteins such as sigma(32) and uncomplexed subunits of membrane protein complexes such as secY of the protein translocase. We describe a protocol for solubilizing the recombinant enzyme from inclusion bodies and its subsequent refolding and purification to near homogeneity. This is a high-yield protocol and produces in excess of 20 mg of purified FtsH per liter of E. coli culture. We found that refolded FtsH has biochemical properties similar to detergent extracted overexpressed protein described previously. FtsH forms a large complex with an apparent mass of 1200 kDa as determined by gel filtration. Both ATPase and protease activities are coincident with this large complex; smaller forms of FtsH do not exhibit either activity. While FtsH-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP can occur in the absence of protein substrate (k(c) = 22 min(-1); K(m) = 23 microM), proteolysis shows an absolute dependence on nucleoside-5&#39;-triphosphates, including ATP, CTP, and various analogues. In the presence of 5 mM ATP, FtsH catalyzes the hydrolysis of sigma(32) with the following observed kinetic parameters: k(c) = 0.18 min(-1) and K(m) = 8.5 microM. Significantly, this reaction is processive and generates no intermediate species, but rather, approximately 10 peptide products, all of MW &lt;3 kDa. FtsH protease also efficiently hydrolyzes the peptide Phe-Gly-His-(NO)2Phe-Phe-Ala-Phe-OMe. Hydrolysis occurs exclusively at the (NO)2Phe-Phe bond (k(c) = 2.1 min(-1); K(m) = 12 microM), and like proteolysis, shows an absolute dependence on NTPs. We propose a mechanism for the coupled hydrolytic activities of FtsH toward ATP and peptide substrates that is consistent with a recently proposed structural model for FtsH.	2003 Sep	Bruckner Robert C,Gunyuzlu Paul L,Stein Ross L	Biochemistry. 42(36) 10843-52	Cell division protein ftsH	MAKNLILWLVIAVVLMSVFQSFGPSESNGRKVDYSTFLQEVNNDQVREARINGREINVTKKDSNRYTTYIPVQDPKLLDNLLTKNVKVVGEPPEEPSLLASIFISWFPMLLLIGVWIFFMRQMQGGGGKGAMSFGKSKARMLTEDQIKTTFADVAGCDEAKEEVAELVEYLREPSRFQKLGGKIPKGVLMVGPPGTGKTLLAKAIAGEAKVPFFTISGSDFVEMFVGVGASRVRDMFEQAKKAAPCIIFIDEIDAVGRQRGAGLGGGHDEREQTLNQMLVEMDGFEGNEGIIVIAATNRPDVLDPALLRPGRFDRQVVVGLPDVRGREQILKVHMRRVPLAPDIDAAIIARGTPGFSGADLANLVNEAALFAARGNKRVVSMVEFEKAKDKIMMGAERRSMVMTEAQKESTAYHEAGHAIIGRLVPEHDPVHKVTIIPRGRALGVTFFLPEGDAISASRQKLESQISTLYGGRLAEEIIYGPEHVSTGASNDIKVATNLARNMVTQWGFSEKLGPLLYAEEEGEVFLGRSVAKAKHMSDETARIIDQEVKALIERNYNRARQLLTDNMDILHAMKDALMKYETIDAPQIDDLMARRDVRPPAGWEEPGASNNSGDNGSPKAPRPVDEPRTPNPGNTMSEQLGDK	proposed molecularity is hexameric	P0AAI3			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15358367	Over-expression in Escherichia coli, functional characterization and refolding of rat dimethylglycine dehydrogenase.	Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (Me(2)GlyDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of dimethylglycine to sarcosine. The enzyme requires flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which is covalently bound to the apoprotein via a histidyl(N3)-(8alpha)FAD linkage. In the present study, the mature form of rat Me(2)GlyDH has been over-expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminally 6-His-tagged fusion protein. The over-expressed protein distributed almost equally between the soluble and insoluble (inclusion bodies) cell fraction. By applying the soluble cell lysate to a nickel-chelating column, two fractions were eluted, both containing a nearly homogeneous protein with a molecular mass of 93 kDa, on SDS-PAGE. The first protein fraction was identified by Western blotting analysis as the covalently flavinylated Me(2)GlyDH. It showed optical properties and specific activity (240 nmol/min/mg protein) similar to those of the native holoenzyme. The second fraction was identified as an underflavinylated (apo-) form of Me(2)GlyDH, with a 700wer specific activity. The recombinant holoenzyme exhibited optimal activity at pH 8.5, an activation energy of about 80 kJ/mol, and two KM values for N,N-dimethylglycine (KM1 = 0.05 mM and KM2 = 9.4 mM), as described for the native holoenzyme. Starting from the inclusion bodies, the unfolded flavinylated enzyme was solubilized by SDS treatment and refolded by an 80-fold dilution step, with a reactivation yield of 50-60%.	2004 Oct	Brizio Carmen,Brandsch Roderich,Bufano Daniela,Pochini Lorena,Indiveri Cesare,Barile Maria	Protein expression and purification. 37(2) 434-42	Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase	MSPIHHHHHHLVPRGSEASNSTMSPPEWKDRAETVIIGGGCVGVSLAYHLAKAGMRDVVLLEKSELTAGSTWHAAGLTTYFHPGINLKKIHYDSIKLYERLEEETGQVVGFHQPGSIRLATTPERVDEFKYQMTRTNWHATEQYIIEPEKIHELFPLLNMDKILAGLYNPGDGHIDPYSLTMALATGARKYGVLLKYPAPVTSLKPRPDGTWDVETPQGSVRANRIVNAAGFWAREVGKMIGLDHPLIPVQHQYVVTSTIPEVKALKRELPVLRDLEGSYYLRQERDGLLFGPYESQEKMKLQASWVAHGVPPGFGKELFESDLDRITEHVEAAMEMVPVLKKADIINIVNGPITYSPDILPMVGPHQGVRNYWVAIGFGYGIIHAGGVGKYLSDWILHGEPPFDLIELDPNRYGKWTTTQYTEAKARESYGFNNIVGYPKEERFAGRPTQRVSGLYKILESKCSMGFHAGWEQPHWFYKPGQDTQYRPSFRRTNWFRPVGSEYKQVMQRVGVIDLSPFGKFNIKGQDSTQLLDHLCANVIPKVGFTNISHMLTPRGRVYAELTVSHQSPGEFLLITGSGSELHDLRWIEEAAVRGGYDVEIRNITDELGVLGVAGPYARRVLQKLTSEDLSDDVFKFLQTKSLKISDIPVTAIRISYTGELGWELYHRREDSAALYERIMNAGQEEGIDNFGTYALNALRLEKAFRAWGSEMNCDTNPLEAGLDYFIKLNKPADFTGKQALKQIKAKGLKRRLVCLTLATDDVDPEGNESVWYKGKVIGNTTSGSYSYSIQKSLAFAYVPVELSEVGQQVEVELLGKNYPATIIQEPLVLTEPTRTRLQKDGRKS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q63342			7	30	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15358367	Over-expression in Escherichia coli, functional characterization and refolding of rat dimethylglycine dehydrogenase.	Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (Me(2)GlyDH) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the oxidative demethylation of dimethylglycine to sarcosine. The enzyme requires flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which is covalently bound to the apoprotein via a histidyl(N3)-(8alpha)FAD linkage. In the present study, the mature form of rat Me(2)GlyDH has been over-expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminally 6-His-tagged fusion protein. The over-expressed protein distributed almost equally between the soluble and insoluble (inclusion bodies) cell fraction.

15737937	The noncanonical binding site of the MED-1 GATA factor defines differentially regulated target genes in the C. elegans mesendoderm.	Mesoderm and endoderm in C. elegans arise from sister cells called MS and E, respectively. The identities of both of these mesendodermal progenitors are controlled by MED-1 and -2, members of the GATA factor family. In the E lineage, these factors activate a sequential cascade of GATA factors, beginning with their immediate targets, the endoderm-specifying end genes. We report that MED-1 binds invariant noncanonical sites in the end genes, revealing that the MEDs are atypical members of the GATA factor family that do not recognize GATA sequences. By searching the genome for clusters of these MED sites, we have identified 19 candidate MED targets. Based on their expression patterns, these define three distinct classes of MED-regulated genes: MS-specific, E-specific, and E plus MS-specific. Some MED targets encode transcription factors related to those that regulate mesendoderm development in other phyla, supporting the existence of an ancient metazoan mesendoderm gene regulatory network.	2005 Mar	Broitman-Maduro Gina,Maduro Morris F,Rothman Joel H	Developmental cell. 8(3) 427-33	GATA-type transcription factor	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMAYPYPVFNAENVFDNTQQQVGFYDYSTPFNGTYSFTTDYSYYNNYYDYVNTYASYYPTAMDSSSLNISSTTGSPNSSHFTTFTHFSTPSTSPSTSTQSSTTPSNSDNKKSFQCSNCSVTETIRWRNIRSKEGIQCNACFIYQRKYNKTRPVTAVNKYQKRKLKVQETNGVDSF	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9GSP3			7.5	37	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16085911	Borrelia burgdorferi BmpA, BmpB, and BmpD proteins are expressed in human infection and contribute to P39 immunoblot reactivity in patients with Lyme disease.	The Bmp proteins are a paralogous family of chromosomally encoded Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteins. They have similar predicted immunogenicities and similar electrophoretic mobilities by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. P39 reactivity against Borrelia burgdorferi lysate in immunoblots of Lyme disease patients has long been identified with reactivity to BmpA, but responses to other Bmp proteins have not been examined. To determine if patients with Lyme disease developed such responses, immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-Bmp reactivity in patient and control sera was studied by using soluble recombinant Bmp (rBmp) proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. Although some patient sera contained IgG immunoblot and immunodot reactivities against all four Bmp proteins, analysis of IgG anti-Bmp fine specificity by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with graded doses of soluble homologous and heterologous rBmp proteins showed that only the responses to BmpA, BmpB, and BmpD were specific. This suggests that at least three of the four Bmp proteins are expressed by B. burgdorferi in infected patients and that specific antibodies to them are likely to be present in the P39 band in some patients.	2005 Aug	Bryksin Anton V,Godfrey Henry P,Carbonaro Carol A,Wormser Gary P,Aguero-Rosenfeld Maria E,Cabello Felipe C	Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology. 12(8) 935-40	Basic membrane protein A precursor	MRGSHHHHHHGSGIMVRPLNSIVAVSQNMGIGKNGDLPWPPLRNEFKYFQRMTTTSSVEGKQNLVIMGRKTWFSIPEKNRPLKDRINIVLSRELKEPPRGAHFLAKSLDDALRLIEQPELASKVDMVWIVGGSSVYQEAMNQPGHLRLFVTRIMQEFESDTFFPEIDLGKYKLLPEYPGVLSEVQEEKGIKYKFEVYEKKGSRSAMNKILLLILLESIVFLSCSGKGSLGSEIPKVSLIIDGTFDDKSFNESALNGVKKVKEEFKIELVLKESSSNSYLSDLEGLKDAGSDLIWLIGYRFSDVAKVAALQNPDMKYAIIDPIYSNDPIPANLVGMTFRAQEGAFLTGYIAAKLSKTGKIGFLGGIEGEIVDAFRYGYEAGAKYANKDIKISTQYIGSFADLEAGRSVATRMYSDEIDIIHHAAGLGGIGAIEVAKELGSGHYIIGVDEDQAYLAPDNVITSTTKDVGRALNIFTSNHLKTNTFEGGKLINYGLKEGVVGFVRNPKMISFELEKEIDNLSSKIINKEIIVPSNKESYEKFLKEFI	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q45010			7.4	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

10065160	Expression, isolation and characterization of a mutated human plasminogen kringle 3 with a functional lysine binding site.	Each kringle of human plasminogen (HPg) except kringle 3 (K3) exhibits affinity for omega-aminocarboxylic acids. Assuming that the K3 domain contains a preformed but nonfunctional lysine binding site (LBS), Lys311 was altered by site-directed mutagenesis into Asp311 in accordance with the consensus sequence of the LBS. Cys297 involved in the interkringle disulfide bridge was mutated into Ser297 to minimize dimerization and aggregation. The mutated K3 TYQ[K3HPg/C297S/K311D]DS (r-K3mut) was expressed in Escherichia coli, isolated on an Ni2(+)-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, refolded and purified on a lysine Bio-Gel column. Fluorescence titration indicates affinity of r-K3mut for omega-aminocarboxylic acids with the following association constants (Kass, mM-1): 5-aminopentanoic acid: 1.3; 6-aminohexanoic acid: 4.2; 7-aminoheptanoic acid: 0.5; trans-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid: 12.7; p-benzylaminesulfonic acid: 11.8. r-K3mut exhibits an affinity similar to native and mutated (R220G, E221D) K2. The results indicate the presence of a preformed but nonfunctional LBS in native K3 of HPg. We were able to demonstrate for the first time that an appropriate mutation in the LBS of a kringle produced a weak but distinct affinity for omega-aminocarboxylic acids.	1999 Jan	Bürgin J,Schaller J	Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS. 55(1) 135-41	Plasminogen	MRGSHHHHHHGSIEGRTYQCLKGTGENYRGNVAVTVSGHTCQHWSAQTPHTHNRTPENFPSKNLDENYCRNPDGDRAPWCHTTNSQVRWEYCKIPSDSCGSA	M,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P00747		Kringle 3 domain	8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9801313	Reconstitution of DNA topoisomerase VI of the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae from subunits separately overexpressed in Escherichia coli.	DNA topoisomerase VI from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus shibatae is the prototype of a novel family of type II DNA topoisomerases that share little sequence similarity with other type II enzymes, including bacterial and eukaryal type II DNA topoisomerases and archaeal DNA gyrases. DNA topoisomerase VI relaxes both negatively and positively supercoiled DNA in the presence of ATP and has no DNA supercoiling activity. The native enzyme is a heterotetramer composed of two subunits, A and B, with apparent molecular masses of 47 and 60 kDa, respectively. Here wereport the overexpression in Escherichia coli and the purification of each subunit. The A subunit exhibits clusters of arginines encoded by rare codons in E.coli . The expression of this protein thus requires the co-expression of the minor E.coli arginyl tRNA which reads AGG and AGA codons. The A subunit expressed in E.coli was obtained from inclusion bodies after denaturation and renaturation. The B subunit was overexpressed in E.coli and purified in soluble form. When purified B subunit was added to the renatured A subunit, ATP-dependent relaxation and decatenation activities of the hyperthermophilic DNA topoisomerase were reconstituted. The reconstituted recombinant enzyme exhibits a specific activity similar to the enzyme purified from S.shibatae . It catalyzes transient double-strand cleavage of DNA and becomes covalently attached to the ends of the cleaved DNA. This cleavage is detected only in the presence of both subunits and in the presence of ATP or its non-hydrolyzable analog AMPPNP.	1998 Nov	Buhler C,Gadelle D,Forterre P,Wang J C,Bergerat A	Nucleic acids research. 26(22) 5157-62	Type II DNA topoisomerase VI	MSSEFISKVDKEARRKAANILRDKFLNLVEQLKKGEPLVMEIPMRTLSNAIYDEKRKLLLLGEKKLRRNFLDLNEAKRFMQTVLMASIIYDALVSDEYPTIRDLYYRGKHSLLLKSIEGNKIVSEENTWDEQKESDSVIVDIEVFTSLLREEMLILSKEKGKVVGNLRIRSGNDVIDLSKTGHGAYAIEPTPDLIDFIDVDAEFVLVVEKDAVFQQLHRAGFWKQYKSILITSAGQPDRATRRFVRRLNEELKLPVYILTDADPYGWYIFSVFRIGSISLSYESERLATPDAKFLGVSMGDIFGNSRKKPYLSEAERKNYIIKAKDADIKRAEEIKNYEWFKTKAWQEEINTFLQRKAKLEIEAMASKGLKFLAFQYIPEKITNKDYIADPNSSSVDKLAAALEKRASQPELAPEDPEDVEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	O05208		A subunit	7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12706668	Immunization against Plasmodium chabaudi malaria using combined formulations of apical membrane antigen-1 and merozoite surface protein-1.	The control of Plasmodium falciparum malaria by vaccination will require immunization with multiple parasite antigens effectively formulated in combination. In this regard, proteins expressed on the surface of blood-stage merozoites are attractive as vaccine targets given their functional importance in the invasion of erythrocytes and accessibility to serum antibodies. We have utilized a Plasmodium chabaudi vaccine model to begin to evaluate the efficacy of immunization with combined formulations of apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) and merozoite surface protein-1 (MSP-1). Using a pET/T7 RNA polymerase bacterial expression system, we have expressed, purified and refolded recombinant antigens representing the 54 kDa ectodomain of Pc AMA-1 and the 42 kDa C-terminus of Pc MSP-1. Immunization with recombinant Pc AMA-1+Pc MSP-1(42) induced a high level of protection against P. chabaudi malaria with protective efficacy varying with antigen dose, choice of adjuvant, and immunization protocol. Based on the reduction of P. chabaudi parasitemia, Alum proved effective for use with the combination of Pc AMA-1 and Pc MSP-1(42). The use of Quil A was similarly effective with single or combined antigen immunizations, particularly with low antigen dose. In general, serological analysis of prechallenge sera indicated a dominant IgG1 response. For a given formulation, immunization with the combination of Pc AMA-1 and Pc MSP-1(42) elicited IgG responses comparable to those observed following immunization with each antigen alone. However, prechallenge antibody titers alone were not predictive of protective efficacy. While Pc AMA-1 and Pc MSP-1(42) can be effectively formulated in combination, further study is needed to define measurable parameters of protective T cell and B cell responses induced by Pc AMA-1+Pc MSP-1(42) that are predictive of vaccine efficacy.	2003 May	Burns James M,Flaherty Patrick R,Romero Margarita M,Weidanz William P	Vaccine. 21(17-18) 1843-52	Merozoite Surface Protein-1	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHEVKDILDAFKSENEYIYTKSLGNTYKSFKKHMLKEFSIIKEDIITGLNYKLEKRNDFLDVLSYELALFKDINTNKFVVKNPYQLLDNDKKDKQMVNLKYAIKGVTEDIETTTDGIEFFNKMIELYKPQLNAVNEQIAAIEKETTDKEEKKKYVPIFEDLKVLYETILNGAEEFSELLQHKLENYKIEKAGFDILMANLETYIKIDEKLEDFVESAEKNKHIASIALNNLNKSGLVTEGESKKILAKMLNMDAMDLLGIGSNHVCISTNTPENAGCFRYDNGTEEWRCLLGFKKNEDNTGCVKDDAPVCNNSNNGGCDPNADCREVENTDTTNSKKIVCTCKEPNPNAYYDGVFCSSS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q86PP5			8.3	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

11787016	Effect of operating variables on the yield of recombinant trypsinogen for a pulse-fed dilution-refolding reactor.	The inclusion body process route for manufacturing proteins offers distinct process advantages in terms of expression levels and the ease of initial inclusion body recovery. The efficiency of the refolding unit operation, however, does determine the overall economic feasibility of a process. Dilution refolding is the simplest and most extensively used refolding operation, although significant yield losses often occur due mainly to aggregation. Operating variables may have a significant effect on the degree of aggregation, but a systematic study has not been reported. This study investigates the effect of operating variables on the dilution refolding of solubilized r-trypsinogen inclusion bodies in a pulse-fed stirred reactor. Variables investigated were inclusion body washing, stirring speed, feed rate, concentration of solubilized r-trypsinogen, and concentration of urea during solubilization of the inclusion bodies. Additionally, the effect of baffles in the reactor was investigated. The yield of renatured r-trypsinogen varied between 12 +/- 0.2% and 21 +/- 1.0 0epending on the specific combination of operating variables employed. It is clear that a suboptimal operating strategy can significantly reduce protein yield. In particular, we note that an increased intensity of mixing adversely affected yield in contrast to previous reports indicating that enhanced dispersion increases yield. We conclude that yield is determined not only by the efficiency of dispersion, but also by the local chemical environment of the protein as it folds, and the rate of change of this environment. This will be controlled by micromixing effects, and hence the intensity of agitation, in a complex manner requiring further characterization.	2002 Feb	Mark Buswell A,Ebtinger Mark,Vertés Alain A,Middelberg Anton P J	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 77(4) 435-44	Trypsinogen	MNPLLILTFVAAALAAPFDDDDKIVGGYNCEENSVPYQVSLNSGYHFCGGSLINEQWVVSAGHCYKSRIQVRLGEHNIEVLEGNEQFINAAKIIRHPQYDRKTLNNDIMLIKLSSRAVINARVSTISLPTAPPATGTKCLISGWGNTASSGADYPDELQCLDAPVLSQAKCEASYPGKITSNMFCVGFLEGGKDSCQGDSGGPVVCNGQLQGVVSWGDGCAQKNKPGVYTKVYNYVKWIKNTIAANS		P07477			9	8	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16103187	Hepatitis C virus core protein is a dimeric alpha-helical protein exhibiting membrane protein features.	The building block of hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleocapsid, the core protein, together with viral RNA, is composed of different domains involved in RNA binding and homo-oligomerization. The HCV core protein 1-169 (C(HCV)169) and its N-terminal region from positions 1 to 117 (C(HCV)117) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity suitable for biochemical and biophysical characterizations. The overall conformation and the oligomeric properties of the resulting proteins C(HCV)169 and C(HCV)117 were investigated by using analytical centrifugation, circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence measurements, and limited proteolysis. Altogether, our results show that core protein (C(HCV)169) behaves as a membranous protein and forms heterogeneous soluble micelle-like aggregates of high molecular weight in the absence of detergent. In contrast, it behaves, in the presence of mild detergent, as a soluble, well-folded, noncovalent dimer. Similar to findings observed for core proteins of HCV-related flaviviruses, the HCV core protein is essentially composed of alpha-helices (50%). In contrast, C(HCV)117 is soluble and monodispersed in the absence of detergent but is unfolded. It appears that the folding of the highly basic domain from positions 2 to 117 (2-117 domain) depends on the presence of the 117-169 hydrophobic domain, which contains the structural determinants ensuring the binding of core with cellular membranes. Finally, our findings provide valuable information for further investigations on isolated core protein, as well as for attempts to reconstitute nucleocapsid particles in vitro.	2005 Sep	Boulant Steeve,Vanbelle Christophe,Ebel Christine,Penin François,Lavergne Jean-Pierre	Journal of virology. 79(17) 11353-65	Hepatitis C virus core protein	MSTNPKPQRKTKRNTNRRPQDVKFPGGGQIVGGVYLLPRRGPRLGVRATRKTSERSQPRGRRQPIPKARRPEGRTWAQPGYPWPLYGNEGCGWAGWLLSPRGSRPSWGPTDPRRRSRNLGKVIDTLTCGFADLMGYIPLVGAPLGGAARALAHGVRVLEDGVNYATGNLLQHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9ELS8			7.5	20	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

10713527	Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the catalytic domain of the adenylate cyclase GRESAG4.1 from Trypanosoma brucei.	Adenylate cyclases (ACs) are involved in signal transduction by generating the second messenger, cAMP. In Trypanosoma brucei, 3&#39;, 5&#39;-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) controls the life cycle of this unicellular parasite. cAMP is generated by a class of adenylate cyclases which are either constitutively (GRESAG4.1-4.3) or transiently expressed (ESAG4) during the life cycle. Unlike mammalian ACs, the trypanosomal ACs have a simple topology comprising of a large extracellular region, a transmembrane helix and a cytosolic catalytic region. Two orthorhombic crystal forms of the catalytic AC domain of GRESAG4.1 (residues Ala884-Thr1132) were generated by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. X-ray diffraction data from GRESAG4.1 crystals were collected at 1.9 A resolution using synchrotron radiation. Furthermore, two heavy-metal derivative data sets were collected from crystal form A; heavy-atom sites were subsequently located in difference Patterson maps.	2000 Mar	Bieger B,Essen L O	Acta crystallographica.

15659452	The rice nucellin gene ortholog OsAsp1 encodes an active aspartic protease without a plant-specific insert and is strongly expressed in early embryo.	The barley nucellin gene was reported to be nucellus specific in its expression and was hypothesized to play a role in the programmed cell death of the nucellus as an aspartic protease. Here we provide direct evidence that the rice ortholog encodes an active aspartic protease, but we prefer the name aspartic protease1 (OsAsp1) to nucellin after a detailed analysis of its expression pattern in rice and barley. Northern blots, RT-PCR and RNA in situ hybridization showed that OsAsp1 is expressed most abundantly in zygotic embryos 1-2 d after fertilization. It is also expressed in pollen, nucellus, ovary wall, shoot and root meristem, coleoptiles of immature seeds, and somatic embryos. A parallel study in barley showed that the barley nucellin gene was expressed not only in the nucellus but also strongly in embryos. Recombinant protein proOsAsp1 expressed in the bacterium Escherichia coli refolded and autolysed at acidic pH 3.5 in vitro, and the mature peptide displayed protease activity. Nucellin has three close homologs in rice on chromosomes 11 and 12 and in Arabidopsis on chromosomes 1 and 4. They lack the plant-specific insert that distinguishes the typical plant aspartic protease from aspartic proteases of other organisms. They constitute a new class of aspartic protease that is present in both monocots and dicots but whose function remains to be explored further.	2005 Jan	Bi Xuezhi,Khush Gurdev S,Bennett John	Plant &amp; cell physiology. 46(1) 87-98	Aspartic proteinase Asp1	MSKQIESKTAFQEALDAAGDKLVVVDFSATWCGPCKMIKPFFHSLSEKYSNVIFLEVDVDDCQDVASECEVKCMPTFQFFKKGQKVGEFSGANKEKLEATINELVLAGSGSGHMHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSGMKETAAAKPERQHMDSPVVLELHGNVYPIGHFFVTMNISDPAKPYFLDIDTGSTLTWLQCDYPCINCNKVPHGLYKPELKYAVKCTEQRCADLYADLRKPMKCGPKNQCHYGIQYVGGSSIGVLIVDSFSLPASNGTNPTSIAFGCGYNQGKNNHNVPTPVNGILGLGRGKVTLLSQLKSQGVITKHVLGHCISSKGKGFLFFGDAKVPTSGVTWSPMNREHKHYSPRQGTLHFNSNSKPISAAPMEVIFDSGATYTYFALQPYHATLSVVKSTLSKECKFLTEVKEKDRALTVCWKGKDKIRTIDEVKKCFRSLSLKFADGDKKATLEIPPEHYLIISQEGHVCLGILDGSKEHPSLAGTNLIGGITMLDQMVIYDSERSLLGWVNYQCDRIPRSASAITSRL	N-terminal hexahis + Trx Tag				3.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11802794	Overexpression, purification and biochemical characterization of a class A high-molecular-mass penicillin-binding protein (PBP), PBP1* and its soluble derivative from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	The product of the gene ponA present in cosmid MTCY21D4, one of the collection of clones representing the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has been named penicillin-binding protein 1* (PBP1*), by analogy to the previously characterized PBP1* of M. leprae. This gene has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli. His(6)-tagged PBP1* localizes to the membranes of induced E. coli cells. Its susceptibility to degradation upon proteinase K digestion of spheroplasts from E. coli expressing the protein supports the view that the majority of the protein translocates to the periplasmic side of the membrane. Recombinant PBP1* binds benzylpenicillin and several other beta-lactams, notably cefotaxime, with high affinity. Truncation of the N-terminal 64 amino acid residues results in an expressed protein present exclusively in inclusion bodies and unable to associate with the membrane. The C-terminal module encompassing amino acids 272-663 can be extracted from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions using guanidine/HCl and refolded to give a protein fully competent in penicillin-binding. Deletion of Gly(95)-Gln(143) results in the expression of a protein, which is localized in the cytosol. The soluble derivative of PBP1* binds benzylpenicillin with the same efficiency as the full-length protein.

15947865	AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase from the extremely halophilic archaeon Haloarcula marismortui: purification, identification and expression of the encoding gene, and phylogenetic affiliation.	Halophilic archaea activate acetate via an (acetate)-inducible AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), (Acetate+ATP+CoA --&gt; Acetyl-CoA+AMP+PP(i)). The enzyme from Haloarcula marismortui was purified to homogeneity. It constitutes a 72-kDa monomer and exhibited a temperature optimum of 41 degrees C and a pH optimum of 7.5. For optimal activity, concentrations between 1 M and 1.5 M KCl were required, whereas NaCl had no effect. The enzyme was specific for acetate (100%) additionally accepting only propionate (30%) as substrate. The kinetic constants were determined in both directions of the reaction at 37 degrees C. Using the N-terminal amino acid sequence an open reading frame - coding for a 74 kDa protein - was identified in the partially sequenced genome of H. marismortui. The function of the ORF as acs gene was proven by functional overexpression in Escherichia coli. The recombinant enzyme was reactivated from inclusion bodies, following solubilization in urea and refolding in the presence of salts, reduced and oxidized glutathione and substrates. Refolding was dependent on salt concentrations of at least 2 M KCl. The recombinant enzyme showed almost identical molecular and catalytic properties as the native enzyme. Sequence comparison of the Haloarcula ACS indicate high similarity to characterized ACSs from bacteria and eukarya and the archaeon Methanosaeta. Phylogenetic analysis of ACS sequences from all three domains revealed a distinct archaeal cluster suggesting monophyletic origin of archaeal ACS.	2005 Oct	Bräsen Christopher,Schönheit Peter	Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions. 9(5) 355-65	AMP-Forming acetyl-CoA synthetase	MSDEDVQLEARLEEQEVFEPPESFVEQANVTDEGIYDEFEENWPECWEGAADLLDWEEEYDQVLDDSNPPFYEWFTDGTLNASANCLDRHLDERGDEAAIEWVGEPVEEDNITYTYEELHQKVNEFAAGLREMGVGEDDVVTMYMPMIPQLPIAMLACARIGAPHSVVFAGFSADALATRMNSADSEYLVTCDGYYRRGDPLDHLDKANEGLSGVDHEVERAIVAERLMDGDGFDHDYADNQVAFEDVIDDNEGETVEPVDRDAEDMLFLMYTSGTTGKPKGVKHSTGGYLAWAAWTSQAVLDIKPEDTYFCSADIGWITGHSYIVYGPLALGTTTMMYEGTPDYPDKDRLWDIVEEYEADQLYTAPTAIRAFMKWGKQYPEQHDLSSLRLLGTVGEPINPRAWKWYYKHIGNEECPVVDTWWQTETGGMMITTLPGVKDMKPGSAGPPLPGNDVRIVDTEGEEVEPGRAGYLTVDKPWPGMLRTLYKNDERFIDEYWAEYSDTDSDDSDDWVYFPEDGAKIDDDGYITVLGRVDDVINVSGHRLGTMEIESAIVGVEGVAEAAVVGGDHDIKGEAVYAYVITEDGYDEDEELRSAIIDGVEDAIGPIARPEAVIFTPELPKTRSGKIMRRLLEDIANGEELGDTSTLRNPDVVSDIETKVQGDENIRLLTKPERKSYLLPPLSDD	C-terminal sequence	Q5V2H9			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15322277	Buried hydrophobic side-chains essential for the folding of the parallel beta-helix domains of the P22 tailspike.	The processive beta-strands and turns of a polypeptide parallel beta-helix represent one of the topologically simplest beta-sheet folds. The three subunits of the tailspike adhesin of phage P22 each contain 13 rungs of a parallel beta-helix followed by an interdigitated section of triple-stranded beta-helix. Long stacks of hydrophobic residues dominate the elongated buried core of these two beta-helix domains and extend into the core of the contiguous triple beta-prism domain. To test whether these side-chain stacks represent essential residues for driving the chain into the correct fold, each of three stacked phenylalanine residues within the buried core were substituted with less bulky amino acids. The mutant chains with alanine in place of phenylalanine were defective in intracellular folding. The chains accumulated exclusively in the aggregated inclusion body state regardless of temperature of folding. These severe folding defects indicate that the stacked phenylalanine residues are essential for correct parallel beta-helix folding. Replacement of the same phenylalanine residues with valine or leucine also impaired folding in vivo, but with less severity. Mutants were also constructed in a second buried stack that extends into the intertwined triple-stranded beta-helix and contiguous beta-prism regions of the protein. These mutants exhibited severe defects in later stages of chain folding or assembly, accumulating as misfolded but soluble multimeric species.

To produce a thrombi-targeting plasminogen activator, low molecular weight single-chain urokinase gene (scuPA32k) was spliced with the full-length cDNA of annexin B1 gene (anxB1) by overlap extension method. The fused gene anxB1scuPA was ligated into pET28a vector, transformed into E. coli BL21-RIL, and then induced to express under the control of T7 promoter. The AnxB1ScuPA protein expressed amounted to 220f the total bacterial proteins. The product was refolded, and then purified by using DEAE Sepharose fast flow ion-exchange column and Superdex S-200 gel-filtration column. HPLC analysis revealed that the final purity is about 95%. The specific activity of AnxB1ScuPA, measured as amidolytic activity, reached 100,000 IU/mg. It had a similar S2444 catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) to ScuPA32k, and also showed high activated-platelet membrane-binding activity and anticoagulant activity, indicating that the chimera fully retained the components of enzymatic and membrane-binding activities of the parent molecules. In vivo test revealed that, the dogs administered with AnxB1ScuPA had less reperfusion time, higher reperfusion ratio, and less bleeding effects than those with urokinase. These findings indicated that AnxB1ScuPA might have advantages over current available thrombolytic agents.	2004 Mar	Yan Hong-Li,Wang Wei-Ting,He Yan,Zhao Zhuan-You,Gao Yuan-Jian,Zhang Yi,Sun Shu-Han	Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica. 36(3) 184-90	Annexin B1	MAYCRSLVHLYAPNGEKYKPTITPTPGFSPTADAEHLKRAMRGLGTNERAIIDILGNRTSAERMAIRDAYPSISSKTLHDALTSELSGKFRRFALLLIQSPWQVMAEALYDAMKGAGTKERVLNEIIAGCSKDDIPQLKKAFEEVSGGETLDDAIKGDTSGDYREALLLALAGQADEPQAMQLKNLTPSTLSQVVNPGLAETDAKELYACGEGRPGTAESRFMRPIVNRSFLQLNATNEAYNRAYGHPLIDAIKKETSRDLEDFLITRVRYATDRASLFAELLHFAMRGAGTKDSTLQRVLALRADTDLGSIKEKYAELYGETLEAAIKGDTSGDYEALCLKLIGPALKFQCGQKTLRPRFKIIGGEFTTIENQPWFAAIYRRHRGGSVTYVCGGSLMSPCWVISATHCFIDYPKKEDYIVYLGRSRLNSNTQGEMKFEVENLILHKDYSADTLAHHNDIALLKIRSKEGRCAQPSRTIQTICLPSMYNDPQFGTSCEITGFGKENSTDYLYPEQLKMTVVKLISHRECQQPHYYGSEVTTKMLCAADPQWKTDSCQGDSGGPLVCSLQGRMTLTGIVSWGRGCALKDKPGVYTRVSHFLPWIRSHTKEENGLAL	Urokinase chimeric partner: aa.144-411 of mature urokinase (aa. 164-431 of precursor)UniProt: UROK_HUMANSCOP family: Eukaryotic proteasesSCOP Unique ID:50543	Q9XZL9			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
12880771	The N-terminal stem region of bovine and human beta1,4-galactosyltransferase I increases the in vitro folding efficiency of their catalytic domain from inclusion bodies.	Many recombinant proteins overexpressed in Escherichia coli are generally misfolded, which then aggregate and accumulate as inclusion bodies. The catalytic domain (CD) of bovine and human beta1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4Gal-T), expressed in E. coli, it also accumulates as inclusion bodies. We studied the effect of the fusion of the stem region (SR), as an N-terminal extension of the catalytic domain, on the in vitro folding efficiencies of the inclusion bodies. The stem region fused to the catalytic domain (SRCD) increases the folding efficiency of recombinant protein with native fold compared to the protein that contains only the CD. During in vitro folding, also promotes considerably the solubility of the misfolded proteins, which do not bind to UDP-agarose columns and exhibit no galactosyltransferase activity. In contrast, the misfolded proteins that consist of only the CD are insoluble and precipitate out of solution. It is concluded that a protein domain that is produced in a soluble form does not guarantee the presence of the protein molecules in a properly folded and active form. The stem domain has a positive effect on the in vitro folding efficiency of the catalytic domain of both human and bovine beta4Gal-T1, suggesting that the stem region acts as a chaperone during protein folding. Furthermore, investigation of the folding conditions of the sulphonated inclusion bodies resulted in identifying a condition in which the presence of PEG-4000 and L-arginine, compared to their absence, increased the yields of native CD and SRCD 7- and 3-fold, respectively.	2003 Aug	Boeggeman Elizabeth E,Ramakrishnan Boopathy,Qasba Pradman K	Protein expression and purification. 30(2) 219-29	Beta 1, 4 galactosyltransferase I	MASMTGGQQMGRGRDLSRLPQLVGVSTPLQGGSNSAAAIGQSSGELRTGGARPPPPLGASSQPRPGGDSSPVVDSGPGPASNLTSVPVPHTTALSLPACPEESPLLVGPMLIEFNMPVDLELVAKQNPNVKMGGRYAPRDCVSPHKVAIIIPFRNRQEHLKYWLYYLHPVLQRQQLDYGIYVINQAGDTIFNRAKLLNVGFQEALKDYDYTCFVFSDVDLIPMNDHNAYRCFSQPRHISVAMDKFGFSLPYVQYFGGVSALSKQQFLTINGFPNNYWGWGGEDDDIFNRLVFRGMSISRPNAVVGRCRMIRHSRDKKNEPNPQRFDRIAHTKETMLSDGLNSLTYQVLDVQRYPLYTQITVDIGTPS	N-terminal T7 tag	P15291			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

7565814	A genetically engineered single-chain FV/TNF molecule possesses the anti-tumor immunoreactivity of FV as well as the cytotoxic activity of tumor necrosis factor.	Recombinant DNA techniques were used to clone, construct and express the fused gene FV-TNF in E. coli under control of the strong T7 bacteriophage promoter in the expression vector pT7-7-FV-TNF. The fusion protein FV/TNF in inclusion bodies from the bacteria homogenate was solubilized in the denaturing solution containing 6 mol/l guanidine and 0.3 mol/l DTT and refolded in refolding buffer containing 8 mmol/l GSSG. The FV/TNF was purified by ion exchange chromatography. The yield of FV/TNF was estimated at 10 mg/l. The purified FV/TNF displayed a single band of 42 kD under reducing conditions, whereas it showed three forms including its monomer (40/42 kD), its dimer (84 kD) and its trimer (126 kD) under non-reducing conditions. Our data showed that this fusion protein retained its bifunctional activities well, namely the anti-TAG72 immunoreactivity of the FV portion and the cytotoxic activity of the TNF moiety. Therefore, the FV/TNF fusion protein may prove useful in targeting the biological effect of TNF to tumor cells as well as in stimulating the immune destruction of tumor cells.	1995 Aug	Yang J,Moyana T,Xiang J	Molecular immunology. 32(12) 873-81	Tumor necrosis factor alpha	MARIQQSDAELVKPGASVKISCKASGYTFTDHAIHWAKQKPEQGLEWIGYISPGNDDIKYNEKFKGKATLTADKSSSTAYMQLNSLTSEDSAVYFCKRSYYGHWGQGTTLTGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSRIQMTQSPASLSVSVGELVTITCRASENIYSNLAWYQQKQGKSPQLLVYAATNLADGVPSRFSGSGSGTQYSLKINSLQSEDFGSYYCQHFWGTPYTFGGGTKLEIKRVVRSSSRTPSDKPVAHVVANPQAEGQLQWLNRRANALLANGVELRDNQLVVPSEGLYLIYSQVLFKGQGCPSTHVLLTHTISRIAVSYQTKVNLLSAIKSPCQRETPEGAEAKPWYEPIYLGGVFQLEKGDRLSAEINRPDYLDFAESGQVYFGIIAL		P01375			8	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12122021	Studies on the metal binding sites in the catalytic domain of beta1,4-galactosyltransferase.	The catalytic domain of bovine beta1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4Gal-T1) has been shown to have two metal binding sites, each with a distinct binding affinity. Site I binds Mn(2+) with high affinity and does not bind Ca(2+), whereas site II binds a variety of metal ions, including Ca(2+). The catalytic region of beta4Gal-T1 has DXD motifs, associated with metal binding in glycosyltransferases, in two separate sequences: D(242)YDYNCFVFSDVD(254) (region I) and W(312)GWGGEDDD(320) (region II). Recently, the crystal structure of beta4Gal-T1 bound with UDP, Mn(2+), and alpha-lactalbumin was determined in our laboratory. It shows that in the primary metal binding site of beta4Gal-T1, the Mn(2+) ion, is coordinated to five ligands, two supplied by the phosphates of the sugar nucleotide and the other three by Asp254, His347, and Met344. The residue Asp254 in the D(252)VD(254) sequence in region I is the only residue that is coordinated to the Mn(2+) ion. Region II forms a loop structure and contains the E(317)DDD(320) sequence in which residues Asp318 and Asp319 are directly involved in GlcNAc binding. This study, using site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic, and binding affinity analysis, shows that Asp254 and His347 are strong metal ligands, whereas Met344, which coordinates less strongly, can be substituted by alanine or glutamine. Specifically, substitution of Met344 to Gln has a less severe effect on the catalysis driven by Co(2+). Glu317 and Asp320 mutants, when partially activated by Mn(2+) binding to the primary site, can be further activated by Co(2+) or inhibited by Ca(2+), an effect that is the opposite of what is observed with the wild-type enzyme.	2002 Jul	Boeggeman Elizabeth,Qasba Pradman K	Glycobiology. 12(7) 395-407	Beta 1, 4 galactosyltransferase I	MASMTGGQQMGRGRDLRRLPQLVGVHPPLQGSSHGAAAIGQPSGELRLRGVAPPPPLQNSSKPRSRAPSNLDAYSHPGPGPGPGSNLTSAPVPSTTTRSLTACPEESPLLVGPMLIEFNIPVDLKLIEQQNPKVKLGGRYTPMDCISPHKVAIIILFRNRQEHLKYWLYYLHPILQRQQLDYGIYVINQAGESMFNRAKLLNVGFKEALKNYDYNCFVFSDVDLIPMNDHNTYRCFSQPRHISVAMDKFGFSLPYVQYFGGVSALSKQQFLSINGFPNNYWGWGGEDDDIYNRLAFRGMSVSRPNAVIGKCRMIRHSRDKKNEPNPQRFDRIAHTKETMLSDGLNSLTYMVLEVQRYPLYTKITVDIGTPS	N-terminal T7 tag	P08037			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The residue Asp254 in the D(252)VD(254) sequence in region I is the only residue that is coordinated to the Mn(2+) ion. Region II forms a loop structure and contains the E(317)DDD(320) sequence in which residues Asp318 and Asp319 are directly involved in GlcNAc binding. This study, using site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic, and binding affinity analysis, shows that Asp254 and His347 are strong metal ligands, whereas Met344, which coordinates less strongly, can be substituted by alanine or glutamine. Specifically, substitution of Met344 to Gln has a less severe effect on the catalysis driven by Co(2+). Glu317 and Asp320 mutants, when partially activated by Mn(2+) binding to the primary site, can be further activated by Co(2+) or inhibited by Ca(2+), an effect that is the opposite of what is observed with the wild-type enzyme.	2002 Jul	Boeggeman Elizabeth,Qasba Pradman K	Glycobiology. 12(7) 395-407	Beta 1, 4 galactosyltransferase I	MASMTGGQQMGRGRDLRRLPQLVGVHPPLQGSSHGAAAIGQPSGELRLRGVAPPPPLQNSSKPRSRAPSNLDAYSHPGPGPGPGSNLTSAPVPSTTTRSLTACPEESPLLVGPMLIEFNIPVDLKLIEQQNPKVKLGGRYTPMDCISPHKVAIIILFRNRQEHLKYWLYYLHPILQRQQLDYGIYVINQAGESMFNRAKLLNVGFKEALKDYEYNCFVFSDVDLIPMNDHNTYRCFSQPRHISVAMDKFGFSLPYVQYFGGVSALSKQQFLSINGFPNNYWGWGGEDDDIYNRLAFRGMSVSRPNAVIGKCRMIRHSRDKKNEPNPQRFDRIAHTKETMLSDGLNSLTYMVLEVQRYPLYTKITVDIGTPS	N-terminal T7 tag	P08037			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12122021	Studies on the metal binding sites in the catalytic domain of beta1,4-galactosyltransferase.	The catalytic domain of bovine beta1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4Gal-T1) has been shown to have two metal binding sites, each with a distinct binding affinity. Site I binds Mn(2+) with high affinity and does not bind Ca(2+), whereas site II binds a variety of metal ions, including Ca(2+). The catalytic region of beta4Gal-T1 has DXD motifs, associated with metal binding in glycosyltransferases, in two separate sequences: D(242)YDYNCFVFSDVD(254) (region I) and W(312)GWGGEDDD(320) (region II).

12122021	Studies on the metal binding sites in the catalytic domain of beta1,4-galactosyltransferase.	The catalytic domain of bovine beta1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4Gal-T1) has been shown to have two metal binding sites, each with a distinct binding affinity. Site I binds Mn(2+) with high affinity and does not bind Ca(2+), whereas site II binds a variety of metal ions, including Ca(2+). The catalytic region of beta4Gal-T1 has DXD motifs, associated with metal binding in glycosyltransferases, in two separate sequences: D(242)YDYNCFVFSDVD(254) (region I) and W(312)GWGGEDDD(320) (region II). Recently, the crystal structure of beta4Gal-T1 bound with UDP, Mn(2+), and alpha-lactalbumin was determined in our laboratory. It shows that in the primary metal binding site of beta4Gal-T1, the Mn(2+) ion, is coordinated to five ligands, two supplied by the phosphates of the sugar nucleotide and the other three by Asp254, His347, and Met344. The residue Asp254 in the D(252)VD(254) sequence in region I is the only residue that is coordinated to the Mn(2+) ion.

Glu317 and Asp320 mutants, when partially activated by Mn(2+) binding to the primary site, can be further activated by Co(2+) or inhibited by Ca(2+), an effect that is the opposite of what is observed with the wild-type enzyme.	2002 Jul	Boeggeman Elizabeth,Qasba Pradman K	Glycobiology. 12(7) 395-407	Beta 1, 4 galactosyltransferase I	MASMTGGQQMGRGRDLRRLPQLVGVHPPLQGSSHGAAAIGQPSGELRLRGVAPPPPLQNSSKPRSRAPSNLDAYSHPGPGPGPGSNLTSAPVPSTTTRSLTACPEESPLLVGPMLIEFNIPVDLKLIEQQNPKVKLGGRYTPMDCISPHKVAIIILFRNRQEHLKYWLYYLHPILQRQQLDYGIYVINQAGESMFNRAKLLNVGFKEALKDYDYNCFVFSDVDLIPMNDHNTYRCFSQPRHISVAMDKFGFSLPYVQYFGGVSALSKQQFLSINGFPNNYWGWGGEDDDIYNRLAFRGMSVSRPNAVIGKCRMIRESRDKKNEPNPQRFDRIAHTKETMLSDGLNSLTYMVLEVQRYPLYTKITVDIGTPS	N-terminal T7 tag	P08037			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12122021	Studies on the metal binding sites in the catalytic domain of beta1,4-galactosyltransferase.	The catalytic domain of bovine beta1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4Gal-T1) has been shown to have two metal binding sites, each with a distinct binding affinity. Site I binds Mn(2+) with high affinity and does not bind Ca(2+), whereas site II binds a variety of metal ions, including Ca(2+). The catalytic region of beta4Gal-T1 has DXD motifs, associated with metal binding in glycosyltransferases, in two separate sequences: D(242)YDYNCFVFSDVD(254) (region I) and W(312)GWGGEDDD(320) (region II). Recently, the crystal structure of beta4Gal-T1 bound with UDP, Mn(2+), and alpha-lactalbumin was determined in our laboratory. It shows that in the primary metal binding site of beta4Gal-T1, the Mn(2+) ion, is coordinated to five ligands, two supplied by the phosphates of the sugar nucleotide and the other three by Asp254, His347, and Met344. The residue Asp254 in the D(252)VD(254) sequence in region I is the only residue that is coordinated to the Mn(2+) ion. Region II forms a loop structure and contains the E(317)DDD(320) sequence in which residues Asp318 and Asp319 are directly involved in GlcNAc binding. This study, using site-directed mutagenesis, kinetic, and binding affinity analysis, shows that Asp254 and His347 are strong metal ligands, whereas Met344, which coordinates less strongly, can be substituted by alanine or glutamine.

9698563	A bivalent disulfide-stabilized Fv with improved antigen binding to erbB2.	We have used protein engineering to generate a stable bivalent Fv molecule of the anti-erbB2 monoclonal antibody e23. The VH and VL domains of the Fv are linked to each other by a disulfide bond and the two Fvs are connected by a flexible 15 amino acid residue (Gly4-Ser)3 linker. The e23 (dsFv)2 molecule is fused to a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin to generate a bivalent disulfide-stabilized, (dsFv)2, immunotoxin. The immunotoxin was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded in vitro and purified to about 95d0c850urity. Binding studies demonstrated that the (dsFv)2 molecule has a much higher affinity for erbB2 than a monovalent dsFv molecule and a similar binding affinity as the parental antibody e23. The (dsFv)2 immunotoxin was 5 to 20-fold more cytotoxic to two e23 antigen-positive cell lines than the monovalent dsFv immunotoxin. The bivalent dsFv molecule is very stable, retaining 940f its activity after a 24 hours incubation in human serum at 37 degreesC. Two other molecules with shorter linkers five and ten amino acid residues in length were produced and showed similar activities as the molecule containing a 15 amino acid residue linker. The bivalency, stability and the relative ease of purification makes these e23 (dsFv)2 molecules valuable reagents for cancer immunotherapy and diagnosis.	1998 Aug	Bera T K,Onda M,Brinkmann U,Pastan I	Journal of molecular biology. 281(3) 475-83	Bivalent e23 dsFv	DVQLTQSPAILSASPGEKVTMTCRATPSVSYMHWYQQKPGSSPKPWIYTTSNLASGVPARFSGGGSGTSYSLTVSRVEAEDAATYYCQQWSRSPPTFGGGSKEVQLQESGPEVVKPGGSMKISCKTSGYSFTGHTMNWVKQSHGKNLEWIGLINPYNGDTNYNQKFKGKATGTVDKSSSTAYMELLSLTSEDSAVYYCARRVTDWYFDVWGAGTTVTVSGGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSDVQLTQSPAILSASPGEKVTMTCRATPSVSYMHWYQQKPGSSPKPWIYTTSNLASGVPARFSGGGSGTSYSLTVSRVEAEDAATYYCQQWSRSPPTFGGGSKEVQLQESGPEVVKPGGSMKISCKTSGYSFTGHTMNWVKQSHGKNLEWIGLINPYNGDTNYNQKFKGKATGTVDKSSSTAYMELLSLTSEDSAVYYCARRVTDWYFDVWGAGTTVTVSMLQGTKLMAEEGGSLAALTAHQACHLPLETFTRHRQPRGWEQLEQCGYPVQRLVALYLAARLSQNQVDQVIRNALASPGSGGDLGEAIREQPEQARLALTLAAAESERFVRQGTGNDEAFAANFPADSGDALLERNYPTGAEFLGDFFDVSFSTRGTQNWTVERLLQAHRQLEERGYVFVGYHGTFLEAAQSIVFGGVRARSQDLDAIWRGFYIAGDPALAYGYAQDQEPDARGRIRNGALLRVYVPRSSLPGFYRTSLTLAAPEAAGEVERLIGHPLPLRLDAITGPEEEGGRLETILGWRPLAERTVVIPSAIPTDPRNVGGDLDPSSIPDKEQAISALPDYASQPGKPPREDLK		P01756			8	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9226715	A general purification protocol for E7 proteins from &quot;high- and low-risk&quot; human papillomavirus types expressed in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.	A purification protocol was developed to obtain human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 E7 protein expressed in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Only three chromatographic steps were necessary to purify the unfused HPV 16 E7 protein to homogeneity (95-99%) as shown by silver staining after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 0.8 mg of highly purified E7 was obtained from 5 x 10(10) yeast cells. The purified HPV 16 E7 phosphoprotein (Ser 31/32) was refolded and assayed for functionality. Binding to the proteins Rb1 and p107 in vitro and induction of DNA synthesis after microinjection into serum-deprived NIH 3T3 cells suggest that the E7 protein retains some of its biological activities. Most importantly, the purification strategy is also applicable for different HPV 16 E7 mutants and for E7 proteins from other HPV types such as HPV 18 and 11.	1997 Jul	Braspenning J,Manetti R,Zumbach K,Meschede W,Gissmann L,Tommasino M	Protein expression and purification. 10(2) 192-201	Protein E7	MHGDTPTLHEYMLDLQPETTDLYCYEQLNDSSEEEDEIDGPAGQAEPDRAHYNIVTFCCKCDSTLRLCVQSTHVDIRTLEDLLMGTLGIVCPICSQKP		P03129			7.2	20	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16171815	Characterization of T cell receptors engineered for high affinity against toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.	Superantigens, including bacterial enterotoxins, are a family of proteins that bind simultaneously to MHC class II molecules and the Vbeta regions of T cell receptors. This cross-linking results in the activation of a large population of T cells that release massive amounts of inflammatory cytokines, ultimately causing a condition known as toxic shock syndrome. The staphylococcal superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) is a causative agent of this disease, but its structure in complex with the cognate T cell receptor (human Vbeta2.1) has not been determined. To understand the molecular details of the interaction and to develop high affinity antagonists to TSST-1, we used directed evolution to generate a panel of high affinity receptors for TSST-1. Yeast display libraries of random and site-directed hVbeta2.1 mutants were selected for improved domain stability and for higher affinity binding to TSST-1. Stability mutations allowed the individual Vbeta domains to be expressed in a bacterial expression system. Affinity mutations were generated in CDR2 and FR3 residues, yielding improvements in affinity of greater than 10,000-fold (a K(D) value of 180 pmol). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of hVbeta2.1 wild-type and mutated residues allowed us to generate a map of the binding site for TSST-1 and to construct a docking model for the hVbeta2.1-TSST-1 complex. Our experiments suggest that the energetic importance of a single hVbeta2.1 wild-type residue likely accounts for the restriction of TSST-1 specificity to only this human Vbeta region. The high affinity mutants described here thus provide critical insight into the molecular basis of TSST-1 specificity and serve as potential leads toward the development of therapeutic agents for superantigen-mediated disease.	2005 Oct	Buonpane Rebecca A,Moza Beenu,Sundberg Eric J,Kranz David M	Journal of molecular biology. 353(2) 308-21	T cell receptor beta 2.1 chain	GAVVSQHPSRVIAKSGTSVKIECTSLDFQATTMFWYRQFPKQSLMLMATSWEGSKATYEQGVEKDKFLINHASLTLSTLTVTSAHPEDSSFYICSALAGSGSSTDTQYFGPGTRLTVL	A number of alanine scanning mutants for this construct were also made.

9178820	Cloning and expression of the recombinant FAb fragment of monoclonal antibody K1 that reacts with mesothelin present on mesotheliomas and ovarian cancers.	The monoclonal antibody (MAb) K1 recognizes an approximate 40 kDa glycoprotein, mesothelin, that is present on the surface of human mesothelial cells, mesotheliomas and ovarian cancers. We have cloned the cDNAs encoding the variable regions of MAb K1 and constructed plasmids for expression of recombinant K1(FAb). Recombinant FAb was produced in Escherichia coli in inclusion bodies that were solubilized and refolded to active protein. Binding of K1 MAb and FAb was compared by radioactive binding and competition assays and by surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore). Recombinant K1(FAb) binds to cells expressing K1-antigen with a similar affinity as papain derived FAb from K1(IgG) and with a 4- to 10-fold reduced affinity compared with bivalent IgG. The cloned FAb can be used to make higher affinity antibodies and immunoconjugates that could be useful for various types of immunotherapies.	1997 May	Brinkmann U,Webber K,Di Carlo A,Beers R,Chowdhury P,Chang K,Chaudhary V,Gallo M,Pastan I	International journal of cancer.

9665960	Expression and refolding of truncated recombinant major outer membrane protein antigen (r56) of Orientia tsutsugamushi and its use in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.	The variable 56-kDa major outer membrane protein of Orientia tsutsugamushi is the immunodominant antigen in human scrub typhus infections. The gene encoding this protein from Karp strain was cloned into the expression vector pET11a. The recombinant protein (r56) was expressed as a truncated nonfusion protein (amino acids 80 to 456 of the open reading frame) which formed an inclusion body when expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Refolded r56 was purified and compared to purified whole-cell lysate of the Karp strain of O. tsutsugamushi by immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for reactivity with rabbit sera prepared against eight antigenic prototypes of O. tsutsugamushi as well as several other species of Rickettsiales and nonrickettsial antigens. Refolded r56 exhibited broad reactivity with the rabbit antisera against the Orientia prototypes, and the ELISA reactions with the r56 and Karp whole-cell lysate antigens correlated well (r = 0.81, n = 22, sensitivity compared to that of standard ELISA of 91%). Refolded r56 did not react with most antisera against other rickettsial species or control antigens (specificity = 92%, n = 13) using a positive cutoff value determined with eight uninfected rabbit sera. Refolded r56 was evaluated further by ELISA, using 128 sera obtained from patients with suspected scrub typhus from Korat, Thailand, and 74 serum specimens from healthy Thai soldiers. By using the indirect immunoperoxidase assay as the reference assay, the recombinant antigen exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of 930r greater for detection of both IgG and IgM in the ELISA at 1:400 serum dilution. These results strongly suggest that purified r56 is a suitable candidate for replacing the density gradient-purified, rickettsia-derived, whole-cell antigen currently used in the commercial dipstick assay available in the United States.	1998 Jul	Ching W M,Wang H,Eamsila C,Kelly D J,Dasch G A	Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology. 5(4) 519-26	56kDa type-specific outer membrane antigen	MTIAPGFRAEIGVMYLTNITAQVEEGKVKADSVGETKADSVGGKDAPIRKRFKLTPPQPTIMPISIAVRDFGIDIPNQTSAASTSRSLRLNDEQRAAARIAWLKNCAGIDYRVKNPNDPNGPMVINPILLNIPQGNPNPVGNPPQRANPPAGFAIHNHEQWRHLVVGLAALSNANKPSASPVKVLSDKITQIYSDIKHLADIAGIDVPDTSLPNSASVEQIQNKMQELNDLLEELRESFDGYLGGNAFANQIQLNFVMPQQAQQQGQGQQQQAQATAQEAVAAAAVRLLNGNDQIAQLYKDLVKLQRHAGIKKAMEKLAAQQEEDAKNQGEGDCKQQQGTSEKSKKGKDKEAEFDLSMIVGQVKLYADVMITESVSI	protein from O.tsutsugamushi Karp strain used	P37915		aa 80-456 only	8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
11032397	Canine interleukin-13: molecular cloning of full-length cDNA and expression of biologically active recombinant protein.	Interleukin-13 (IL-13) regulates immune responses mediated by type 2 T helper lymphocytes (Th2) in the human and mouse. To study the function of this cytokine in the dog, we have isolated a cDNA that encodes the full-length canine IL-13 (CaIL-13) precursor polypeptide of 131 amino acids. CaIL-13 shares significant homology with the IL-13 amino acid sequences of cattle (54.1%), mouse (39.6%), and rat (36.6%) but shares the highest identity with human IL-13 (HuIL-13) (61.8%). The predicted CaIL-13 mature polypeptide of 111 residues was expressed in bacteria, and recombinant CaIL-13 (rCaIL-13) was isolated from inclusion bodies and refolded. rCaIL-13 stimulated the proliferation of TF-1 cells, which are derived from human erythroleukemia cells and respond to IL-13 as well as to a number of other human and murine cytokines. CaIL-13 mRNA was readily detectable by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in cells from lymph nodes and peripheral blood. The gene sequence and biologically active recombinant protein for CaIL-13 will be useful reagents to determine the role of IL-13 in the regulation of canine immune responses.	2000 Sep	Yang S,Boroughs K L,McDermott M J	Journal of interferon &amp; cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research. 20(9) 779-85	Interleukin-13	MALWLTVVIALTCLGGLASPSPVTPSPTLKELIEELVNITQNQASLCNGSMVWSVNLTAGMYCAALESLINVSDCSAIQRTQRMLKALCSQKPAAGQISSERSRDTKIEVIQLVKNLLTYVRGVYRHGNFR		Q9N0W9			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15749013	TbMP42, a protein component of the RNA editing complex in African trypanosomes, has endo-exoribonuclease activity.	RNA editing in trypanosomatids is catalyzed by a high molecular mass RNP complex, which is only partially characterized. TbMP42 is a 42 kDa protein of unknown function that copurifies with the editing complex. The polypeptide is characterized by two Zn fingers and a potential barrel structure/OB-fold at its C terminus. Using recombinant TbMP42, we show that the protein can bind to dsRNA and dsDNA but fails to recognize DNA/RNA hybrids. rTbMP42 degrades ssRNA by a 3&#39; to 5&#39; exoribonuclease activity. In addition, rTbMP42 has endoribonuclease activity, which preferentially hydrolyzes non-base-paired uridylate-containing sequences. Gene silencing of TbMP42 inhibits cell growth and is ultimately lethal to the parasite. Mitochondrial extracts from TbMP42-minus trypanosomes have only residual RNA editing activity and strongly reduced endo-exoribonuclease activity. However, all three activities can be restored by the addition of rTbMP42. Together, the data suggest that TbMP42 contributes both endo- and exoribonuclease activity to the editing reaction cycle.	2005 Mar	Brecht Michael,Niemann Moritz,Schlüter Elke,Müller Ulrich F,Stuart Ken,Göringer H Ulrich	Molecular cell. 17(5) 621-30	RNA-editing complex protein MP42	MKRVTSHISRFLPLVLSQRGLSTYASPHVSSMRYYGATKCLLASTPDTPSFQCGECGKAFRLINALNHHIMTKHAGKAKAMMNKGGKLEEVNPEEIKNKPQGAMSQPTSPPPSSSTSGTEAASTSPTHSSFPGIPFSPVGGIGLVGTPVGAASHVVNTTTTAANSASGNALSDENADKKTFVCTICQKTFRLEAALQHHYQAKHNMEMPTSSSSSGGASAQPVLQGGATTAGVGSVGFSHTEEETGRSAMGTQYVHSQETILPQAPQYHLDVAPNAPEEGEVAAHWRCVNHCVMLGVVQNIQEGFVFEDKVLQFTLITDFEGPSPGDPDKDFHTVRVFDSDYSSRVKEQLRDGEWFLVTGRLRMVPQYDGSMRKYYHYPVIQVHPGCGSVLKVGGSRSHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q95W13			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

TbMP42 is a 42 kDa protein of unknown function that copurifies with the editing complex. The polypeptide is characterized by two Zn fingers and a potential barrel structure/OB-fold at its C terminus. Using recombinant TbMP42, we show that the protein can bind to dsRNA and dsDNA but fails to recognize DNA/RNA hybrids. rTbMP42 degrades ssRNA by a 3&#39; to 5&#39; exoribonuclease activity. In addition, rTbMP42 has endoribonuclease activity, which preferentially hydrolyzes non-base-paired uridylate-containing sequences. Gene silencing of TbMP42 inhibits cell growth and is ultimately lethal to the parasite. Mitochondrial extracts from TbMP42-minus trypanosomes have only residual RNA editing activity and strongly reduced endo-exoribonuclease activity. However, all three activities can be restored by the addition of rTbMP42. Together, the data suggest that TbMP42 contributes both endo- and exoribonuclease activity to the editing reaction cycle.	2005 Mar	Brecht Michael,Niemann Moritz,Schlüter Elke,Müller Ulrich F,Stuart Ken,Göringer H Ulrich	Molecular cell. 17(5) 621-30	RNA-editing complex protein MP42	MKRVTSHISRFLPLVLSQRGLSTYASPHVSSMRYYGATKCLLASTPDTPSFQCGECGKAFRLINALNHHIMTKHAGKAKAMMNKGGKLEEVNPEEIKNKPQGAMSQPTSPPPSSSTSGTEAASTSPTHSSFPGIPFSPVGGIGLVGTPVGGGSRSHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q95W13			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

9305986	Role of carbohydrate structures in the binding of beta1-latency-associated peptide to ligands.	Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a potent growth differentiation and morphogenesis factor. The amino-terminal 248 amino acid pro region of TGF-beta1, the beta1-latency-associated peptide (beta1-LAP), is noncovalently associated with TGF-beta1 in an inactive complex. Previous studies suggested that deglycosylated beta1-LAP can not form this latent complex with TGF-beta1. To study the role of the carbohydrate structures of beta1-LAP in its biological functions, we expressed simian beta1-LAP in Escherichia coli with a 10 histidine residue tag on the N-terminus. This polypeptide was solubilized from inclusion bodies with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography. Purified beta1-LAP was refolded to its dimeric form using a chaotrope-mediated folding procedure. The dimeric beta1-LAP forms 90 kDa complexes with TGF-beta1, TGF-beta2, and TGF-beta3, and reverses the inhibitory activity of TGF-beta1 on Mv1Lu cells. Solid phase binding assays demonstrate that refolded beta1-LAP binds to heparin and thrombospondin 1. FET cell adhesion promoted by refolded beta1-LAP was blocked by an RGD peptide. Purified beta1-LAP produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells, deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F, forms a 80-90 kDa complex with mature TGF-beta1. The carbohydrate structures of beta1-LAP are not required for binding to ligands or for its biological activity.	1997 Sep	Yang Y,Dignam J D,Gentry L E	Biochemistry. 36(39) 11923-32	Transforming growth factor beta 1	MGHHHHHHHHHHSSGHIDGRHMLDLSTCKTIDMELVKRKRIEAIRGQILSKLRLASPPSQGEVPPGPLPEAVLALYNSTRDRVAGESAEPEPEPEADYYAKEVTRVLMVETHNEIYDKFKQSTHSIYMFFNTSELREAVPEPVLLSRAELRLLRLKLKVEQHVELYQKYSNNSWRYLSNRLLAPSDSPEWLSFDVTGVVRQWLSRGGEIEGFRLSAHCSCDSRDNTLQVDINGFTTGRRGDLATIHGMNRPFLLLMATPLERAQHLQSSRHRR	N-terminal poly-histidine tag	P01137		Propeptide: latency-associate peptide aa.30-248	8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15672234	A high cell density fermentation strategy to produce recombinant malarial antigen in E. coli.	A high cell density cultivation method was developed to produce recombinant PvRII, a malaria vaccine candidate, in E. coli for use in vaccine studies. Cells were grown in completely defined media and glucose was fed to achieve a specific growth rate of 0.12 h(-1) until cells reached 55 g dry wt l(-1). Culture was then induced with 1 mM: IPTG and cells were further grown for 4 h to reach 85 g dry wt l(-1) at 0.1 h(-1). Recombinant PvRII was purified from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions using metal affinity chromatography which yielded 10 mg PvRII g(-1) dry wt. After refolding, PvRII was greater than 98d0c850ure, homogeneous and functionally active in that it specifically bound Duffy positive human red cells.	2004 Dec	Yazdani Syed Shams,Shakri Ahmad Rushdi,Chitnis Chetan E	Biotechnology letters. 26(24) 1891-5	Duffy binding protein	GEEKDGEHKTDSKTDNGKGADNLVMLDYETSSNGQPAGTLDNVLEFVTGHEGNSRKNSSNGGNPYDIDHKKTISSAIINHAFLQNTVMKNCNYKRKRRERDWDCNTKKDVCIPDRRYQLCMKELTNLVNNTDTNFHRDITFRKLYLKRKLIYDAAVEGDLLLKLNNYRYNKDFCKDIRWSLGDFGDIIMGTDMEGIGYSKVVENNLRSIFGTDEKAQQRRKQWWNESKAQIWTAMMYSVKKRLKGNFIWICKINVAVNIEPQIYRWIREWGRDYVSELPTEVQKLKEKCDGKINYTDKKVCKVPPCQNACKSYDQWITRKKNQWDVLSNKFISVKNAEKVQTAGIVTPYDILKQELDEFNEVAFENEINKRDGAYIELCVCSVDKLAAALDHHHHHH	Sequence inferred from original UniProt record, inconjunction with Q26145_PLAVI (Duffy receptor binding domain) and general ivormation provided in paper,C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P22290		Receptor-binding domain aa.126-509	7.2	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f

The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was over-expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies to increase its quantity and to facilitate its purification. Insoluble EGFP has been purified on Q Hyper Z matrix by expanded bed adsorption after solubilization in 8 M urea. The adsorption was made in expanded bed mode to avoid centrifugation. EBA-column refolding was done by elimination of urea and elution with NaCl. The EGFP was obtained as a highly purified soluble form with similar behavior in fluorescence and electrophoresis as native EGFP.	2005 Apr	Cabanne C,Noubhani A M,Hocquellet A,Dole F,Dieryck W,Santarelli X	Journal of chromatography.

1370475	Molecular cloning and enzymatic analysis of the rat homolog of &quot;PhK-gamma T,&quot; an isoform of phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit.	Messenger RNA encoding a protein kinase closely related to the catalytic subunit of skeletal muscle phosphorylase kinase has previously been isolated from a human HeLa cell cDNA library, and cross-species Northern hybridization analysis has shown that the rat homolog of this transcript is abundant in the adult testis (Hanks, S.K. (1989) Mol. Endocrinol. 3, 110-116). We now propose that the protein encoded by this transcript be designated as &quot;PhK-gamma T.&quot; In this article, the primary structure of the rat homolog of PhK-gamma T is described, as deduced from nucleotide sequences of cDNA and genomic clones. RNase protection analysis reveals that PhK-gamma T transcripts are actually present in a wide variety of adult rat tissues, but at levels 20-100-fold less than what is observed in the testis. In the testis, transcription of the PhK-gamma T gene is initiated at multiple sites as shown by RNase protection and primer extension. Enzymatic activity of PhK-gamma T was demonstrated using renatured bacterially expressed protein. In the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin, PhK-gamma T is able to efficiently phosphorylate glycogen phosphorylase and convert it from an inactive to an active form. We conclude that PhK-gamma T represents a true isoform of phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit.	1992 Jan	Calalb M B,Fox D T,Hanks S K	The Journal of biological chemistry. 267(3) 1455-63	Phosphorylase Kinase Gamma T	MTLDVGPEDELPDWAAAKEFYQKYDPKDIIGRGVSSVVRRCVHRATGDEFAVKIMEVSAERLSLEQLEEVRDATRREMHILRQVAGHPHIITLIDSYESSSFMFLVFDLMRKGELFDYLTEKVALSEKETRSIMRSLLEAVNFLHVNNIVHRDLKPENILLDDNMQIRLSDFGFSCHLEPGEKLRELCGTPGYLAPEILKCSMDETHPGYGKEVDLWACGVILFTLLAGSPPFWHRRQILMLRMIMEGQYQFSSPEWDDRSNTVKDLIAKLLQVDPNARLTAEQALQHPFFERCKGSQPWNLTPRQRFRVAVWTILAAGRVALSSHRLRPLTKNALLRDPYALRPVRRLIDNCAFRLYGHWVKKGEQQNRAALFQHQPPRPFPIIATDLEGDSSAITEDEVTLVRS		P31325			8.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12007609	Cloning of human 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase in Escherichia coli: characterisation of the purified enzyme and its in vitro inhibition by Zn2+.	3-hydroxyanthranilic acid oxygenase (3-HAO) catalyses the conversion of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid to quinolinic acid. Because of the involvement of quinolinic acid in the initiation of neurodegenerative phenomena, we have cloned human 3-HAO in Escherichia coli, overexpressed and purified it with the aim of studying its enzymatic activity and for future structural studies. The recombinant human protein, obtained in E. coli, retains its enzymatic activity which can occur only in the presence of Fe(II); several other metals have been tested but in no case the formation of the product has been observed. On the contrary, two of the ions tested inhibit the catalytic reaction and one of them, Zn2+, could be of physiological relevance. A circular dichroism analysis has also been performed, showing that the secondary structure is mainly of the beta type, with a minority of alpha.	2002 Apr	Calderone Vito,Trabucco Michela,Menin Valentina,Negro Alessandro,Zanotti Giuseppe	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1596(2) 283-92	3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDLMERRLGVRAWVKENRGSFQPPVCNKLMHQEQLKVMFVGGPNTRKDYHIEEGEEVFYQLEGDMVLRVLEQGKHRDVVIRQGEIFLLPARVPHSPQRFANTVGLVVERRRLETELDGLRYYVGDTMDVLFEKWFYCKDLGTQLAPIIQEFFSSEQYRTGKPIPDQLLKEPPFPLSTRSIMEPMSLDAWLDSHHRELQAGTPLSLFGDTYETQVIAYGQGSSEGLRQNVDVWLWQLEGSSVVTMGGRRLSLAPDDSLLVLAGTSYAWERTQGSVALSVTQDPACKKPLGPEA	N-terminal hexahis + Xpress tag	P46952			8.2	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
11917151	Modifying the chain-length selectivity of the lipase from Burkholderia cepacia KWI-56 through in vitro combinatorial mutagenesis in the substrate-binding site.	The mature lipase of Burkholderia cepacia KWI-56 was synthesized in an enzymatically active form using an in vitro Escherichia coli S30 coupled transcription/translation system by expressing the mature lipase gene (rlip) in the presence of its specific activator. To investigate the substrate specificity of the lipase comprehensively, a large number of mutant lipases were constructed and analyzed in a high throughput manner by combining overlapping PCR and in vitro protein synthesis. In this paper, Phe119 and Leu167, which are located in the acyl portion of the substrate-binding pocket of the lipase of B.cepacia KWI-56, were substituted with six hydrophobic amino acid residues by the in vitro combinatorial mutagenesis. The wild-type and 35 mutant genes amplified by PCR were directly used as templates for the in vitro transcription/translation. The acyl chain-length selectivity of the in vitro expressed lipases against p-nitrophenyl butyrate, p-nitrophenyl caprylate and p-nitrophenyl palmitate, was compared by their relative hydrolysis rates. Two mutant lipases, L167V and F119A/L167M, which showed a significant shift in substrate selectivity were further expressed in vivo and refolded in vitro. It was found that L167V raised its preference for the short-chain ester, whereas F119A/L167M improved its selectivity for the long-chain ester.	2002 Feb	Yang Junhao,Koga Yuichi,Nakano Hideo,Yamane Tsuneo	Protein engineering. 15(2) 147-52	Lipase from Burkholderia cepacia	AAGYAATRYPIILVHGLSGTDKYAGVLEYWYGIQEDLQQNGATVYVANLSGFQSDDGPNGRGEQLLAYVKTVLAATGATKVNLVGHSQGGLSSRYVAAVAPDLVASVTTIGTPHRGSEFADFVQDVLAYDPTGLSSSVIAAFVNVFGILTSSSHNTNQDALAALQTLTTARAATYNQNYPSAGLGAPGSCQTGAPTETVGGNTHLLYSWAGTAIQPTLSVFGVTGATDTSTLPLVDPANVLDLSTLALFGTGTVMINRGSGQNDGLVSKCSALYGKVLSTSYKWNHLDEINQLLGVRGAYAEDPVAVIRTHANRLKLAGV		P22088			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

15866720	Gene cloning, bacterial expression, in vitro refolding, and characterization of a single-chain Fv antibody against PreS1(21-47) fragment of HBsAg.	The murine monoclonal antibody 125E11 is an IgG which recognizes PreS1(21-47) fragment of large hepatitis B surface antigen. It has been successfully used for clinical detection of HBV virion in serum of hepatitis B patients. In present study, the genes of variable region in heavy chain (VH) and light chain (VL) of 125E11 have been cloned. Sequence analysis of cloned VH gene and VL gene showed that they had general characterization of immunoglobin variable region genes. According to Kabat classification, VH gene and VL gene belong to VH10 family, subgroup IIID and Vkappa family subgroup I, respectively. An expression vector of 125E11 single-chain Fv antibody fusion protein, in which VH and VL peptide were connected by a flexible linker (Gly(4)Ser)(3), was constructed. The scFv fusion protein was highly expressed in Escherichia coli mainly in inclusion body form. Using urea and pH gradient gel filtration method, the refolding of scFv was efficiently achieved. The refolding efficiency reached about 11% and 2.7 mg refolded scFv was obtained from 1L of culture. The binding activity and specificity of 125E11 scFv against PreS1(21-47)-containing antigen were also analyzed.	2005 Jun	Yang Xinxiu,Hu Weiguo,Li Feng,Xia Hengchuan,Zhang Zuchuan	Protein expression and purification. 41(2) 341-8	Single chain Fv 125E11	QVQLQESGGGLVQPEGSLKLSCAASGFTFNTYAMHWVRQTPGKGLEWVARIRNKSNNYATYYADSVKDRFTISRDDSQNMLYLQMNNLKTEDTAMYYCVREASGMDYWGQGTTVTVSSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSDIQLTQSPSSLAVSVGEKVSMSCKSSLNLLYNNNQLNYLAWYQQKPGQSPKLLISWASTRESGVPDRFTGSGSGTDFTLTISSVKAEDLAVYYCQQYYTYPYTFGGGTKLEIK	UniProt reference is &quot;best match&quot; only- 84 0dentity to VH chain.

Human stromelysin is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family involved in connective tissue degradation. The stromelysin catalytic domain (SCD) lacking both propeptide and C-terminal fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli in soluble and insoluble forms.

15802238	Expression, refolding, and characterization of human soluble BAFF synthesized in Escherichia coli.	The B lymphocyte stimulator (BAFF) is a novel member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family which is important in B lymphocyte maturation and survival. Here, a recombinant form of the extracellular domain of the BAFF (hsBAFF) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) under the control of a T7 promoter. The resulting insoluble bodies were separated from cellular debris by centrifugation and solubilized with 8 M urea. A rapid and simple on-column refolding procedure was developed. It was applied and then the refolded hsBAFF was purified by anion-exchange. The purified final product was &gt;98d0c850ure by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the protein to be 17.5 kDa, which equalled the theoretically expected mass. The N-terminal sequencing of refolding hsBAFF showed the sequence corresponded to the designed protein. The correct refolding of the recombinant protein was verified in the recovery of its secondary and tertiary structures as assessed by circular dichroism and fluorescence emission spectra. The renatured protein displayed its immunoreactivity with the antibodies to BAFF protein by Western blotting. The final purified material was biologically active in a validated induced human B lymphocyte proliferation bioassay. The expression and in vitro refolding of hsBAFF resulted in production of an active molecule in a yield of 15 mg/L flask cultivation.	2005 May	Cao Peng,Mei Jing Jing,Diao Zhen Yu,Zhang Shuang quan	Protein expression and purification. 41(1) 199-206	B lymphocyte stimulator	AVQGPEETVTQDCLQLIADSETPTIQKGSYTFVPWLLSFKRGSALEEKENKILVKETGYFFIYGQVLYTDKTYAMGHLIQRKKVHVFGDELSLVTLFRCIQNMPETLPNNSCYSAGIAKLEEGDELQLAIPRENAQISLDGDVTFFGALKLL		Q9Y275			8	4	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
9485484	Studies on the binding of alpha-crystallin to recombinant prochymosins and chymosin.	PURPOSE:To further investigate the binding of alpha-crystallin to other proteins as part of its chaperone-like activity, we studied interactions of alpha-crystallin with recombinant calf prochymosins and chymosin.METHODS:Recombinant calf prochymosin B and one C-terminal mutant (PC+2, with two additional residues, Histidine-Glycine) were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Native and mutant proteins were denatured in 8 M urea before being refolded by dilution slowly in phosphate buffer, pH 10.7, in the presence and absence of alpha-crystallin at different concentration ratios. After dialysis, the folded proteins were converted to the active chymosin by acidification. The resulting enzyme activities at standard protein concentrations were determined by a microtitre milk-clotting assay.RESULTS:Refolding of 1.0 mg/ml of protein inclusion bodies diluted in phosphate buffer at 0.32 M urea in the presence of alpha-crystallin resulted in enhanced chymosin activity relative to the control without alpha-crystallin. When lower inclusion body concentrations were used, enzyme activity was not enhanced relative to the control. The mutant enzyme (PC+2) showed no conversion to the active form in the presence of alpha-crystallin. alpha-Crystallin formed a complex with refolded prochymosin, as well as with prochymosin during refolding, but not with active chymosin. Removal of the 43-residue propeptide resulted in loss of alpha-crystallin binding. The addition of two residues (Histidine-Glycine) to the prochymosin C-terminus resulted in precipitation of the mutant prochymosin-alpha-crystallin complex and loss of enzyme activity.CONCLUSIONS:Our experiments show that even under stringent refolding conditions, alpha-crystallin, which retains its gross oligomeric integrity, can bind to unfolded proteins in inclusion bodies and enhance the apparent yield of chymosin activity from high concentrations of inclusion bodies. alpha-Crystallin shows some specificity for binding to its target protein; this specificity may be based on steric considerations as well as residue-specific interactions.	1998 Jan	Chitpinityol S,Goode D,Crabbe M J	Molecular vision. 4 1	Prochymosin	MRCLVVLLAVFALSQGAEITRIPLYKGKSLRKALKEHGLLEDFLQKQQYGISSKYSGFGEVASVPLTNYLDSQYFGKIYLGTPPQEFTVLFDTGSSDFWVPSIYCKSNACKNHQRFDPRKSSTFQNLGKPLSIHYGTGSMQGILGYDTVTVSNIVDIQQTVGLSTQEPGDVFTYAEFDGILGMAYPSLASEYSIPVFDNMMNRHLVAQDLFSVYMDRNGQESMLTLGAIDPSYYTGSLHWVPVTVQQYWQFTVDSVTISGVVVACEGGCQAILDTGTSKLVGPSSDILNIQQAIGATQNQYGEFDIDCDNLSYMPTVVFEINGKMYPLTPSAYTSQDQGFCTSGFQSENHSQKWILGDVFIREYYSVFDRANNLVGLAKAI		P00794			10.7	25	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12878217	The role of tryptophan 1072 in human PDE3B inhibitor binding.	The catalytic domain of recombinant human PDE3B was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and refolded to form active enzyme. A mutation at tryptophan 1072 in PDE3B disrupts inhibitor binding, but has minimal effect on cAMP hydrolysis. The W1072A mutation caused a 158-fold decrease in affinity for cilostamide, a 740-fold decrease for cGMP, and a 15-fold decrease in affinity for IBMX. The corresponding tyrosine mutation had a smaller effect. However, the K(m) of cAMP for the W1072A mutation was only increased by about 7-fold. The data indicate that the inhibitor binding region is not completely coincident with the substrate binding region. The homologous residue in PDE4B is located on helix 16 within 7A of the predicted bound substrate. A model of PDE3B was constructed based on the X-ray crystal structure of PDE4B.	2003 Aug	Chung Christine,Varnerin Jeffrey P,Morin Nancy R,MacNeil Douglas J,Singh Suresh B,Patel Sangita,Scapin Giovanna,Van der Ploeg Lex H T,Tota Michael R	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 307(4) 1045-50	3,5-cyclic phosphodiesterase B	MEQEVSLDLILVEEYDSLIEKMSNWNFPIFELVEKMGEKSGRILSQVMYTLFQDTGLLEIFKIPTQQFMNYFRALENGYRDIPYHNRIHATDVLHAVWYLTTRPVPGLQQIHNGCGTGNETDSDGRINHGRIAYISSKSCSNPDESYGCLSSNIPALELMALYVAAAMHDYDHPGRTNAFLVATNAPQAVLYNDRSVLENHHAASAWNLYLSRPEYNFLLHLDHVEFKRFRFLVIEAILATDLKKHFDFLAEFNAKANDVNSNGIEWSNENDRLLVCQVCIKLADINGPAKVRDLHLKWTEGIVNEFYEQGDEEANLGLPISPFMDRSSPQLAKLQESFITHIVGPLCNSYDAAGLLPGQWLEAEEDNDTESGDDEDGEELDTEDEEMENNLNPKPPRRKSRRRIFCQLMHHLTENHKIWK		Q13370			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9445392	Human insulin production from a novel mini-proinsulin which has high receptor-binding activity.	To increase the folding efficiency of the insulin precursor and the production yield of insulin, we have designed a mini-proinsulin (M2PI) having the central C-peptide region replaced with a sequence forming a reverse turn. The mini-proinsulin was fused at the N-terminus to a 21-residue fusion partner containing a His10 tag for affinity purification. The gene for the fusion protein was inserted downstream of the T7 promoter of the expression plasmid pET-3a, and the fusion proteins were produced as inclusion bodies in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm at levels up to 250f the total cell protein. The protein was sulphonated, cleaved by CNBr and the M2PI mini-proinsulin was purified using ion-exchange chromatography. The refolding yield of M2PI was 20-400etter than that of proinsulin studied at the same molar concentrations, indicating that the short turn-forming sequence is more effective in the refolding process than the much longer C-peptide. Native human insulin was successfully generated by subsequent enzymic conversion of mini-proinsulin. The mini-proinsulin exhibited high receptor-binding activity, about 50% as potent as insulin, suggesting that this single-chained mini-proinsulin may provide a foundation in understanding the receptor-bound structure of insulin as well as the role of C-peptide in the folding and activity of proinsulin.	1998 Feb	Chang S G,Kim D Y,Choi K D,Shin J M,Shin H C	The Biochemical journal. 329 ( Pt 3) 631-5	Insulin	FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKTRRYPGDVKRGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN	N-terminal poly-histidine tag	P01308			11.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
9391042	Overexpression of a glutamate receptor (GluR2) ligand binding domain in Escherichia coli: application of a novel protein folding screen.	Expression of the S1S2 ligand binding domain [Kuusinen, A., Arvola, M. &amp; Keinänen, K. (1995) EMBO J. 14, 6327-6332] of the rat alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid-selective glutamate receptor GluR2 in Escherichia coli under control of a T7 promoter leads to production of &gt;100 mg/liter of histidine-tagged S1S2 protein (HS1S2) in the form of inclusion bodies. Using a novel fractional factorial folding screen and a rational, step-by-step approach, multiple conditions were determined for the folding of the HS1S2 alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid binding domain. Characterization of the HS1S2 ligand binding domain showed that it is water-soluble, monomeric, has significant secondary structure, and is sensitive to trypsinolysis at sites close to the beginning of the putative transmembrane regions. Application of a fractional factorial folding screen to other proteins may provide a useful means to evaluate E. coli as an economical and convenient expression host.	1997 Dec	Chen G Q,Gouaux E	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 94(25) 13431-6	Glutamate receptor 2	MHHHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSAMGSGNDTSGLENKTVVVTTILESPYVMMKKNHEMLEGNERYEGYCVDLAAEIAKHCGFKYKLTIVGDGKYGARDADTKIWNGMVGELVYGKADIAIAPLTITLVREEVIDFSKPFMSLGISIMIKKPQKSKPGVFSFLDPLAYEERMVSPIESAEDLSKQTEIAYGTLDSGSTKEFFRRSKIAVFDKMWTYMRSAEPSVFVRTTAEGVARVRKSKGKYAYLLESTMNEYIEQRKPCDTMKVGGNLDSKGYGIATPKGSSLGNAVNLAVLKLNEQGLLDKLKNKWWYDKGECGSGGGDSKEKTSALSLSN	Domains S1 (SGNDT....PLAYE) and S2 (ERMVSP....SLSN) joined by an 11-amino acid linker, sequence undefined ,N-terminal poly-histidine tag	P19491		Ligand binding core	8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
9865957	Probing the ligand binding domain of the GluR2 receptor by proteolysis and deletion mutagenesis defines domain boundaries and yields a crystallizable construct.	Ionotropic glutamate receptors constitute an important family of ligand-gated ion channels for which there is little biochemical or structural data. Here we probe the domain structure and boundaries of the ligand binding domain of the AMPA-sensitive GluR2 receptor by limited proteolysis and deletion mutagenesis. To identify the proteolytic fragments, Maldi mass spectrometry and N-terminal amino acid sequencing were employed. Trypsin digestion of HS1S2 (Chen GQ, Gouaux E. 1997. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94:13431-13436) in the presence and absence of glutamate showed that the ligand stabilized the S1 and S2 fragments against complete digestion. Using limited proteolysis and multiple sequence alignments of glutamate receptors as guides, nine constructs were made, folded, and screened for ligand binding activity. From this screen, the S1S21 construct proved to be trypsin- and chymotrypsin-resistant, stable to storage at 4 degrees C, and amenable to three-dimensional crystal formation. The HS1S21 variant was readily prepared on a large scale, the His tag was easily removed by trypsin, and crystals were produced that diffracted to beyond 1.5 A resolution. These experiments, for the first time, pave the way to economical overproduction of the ligand binding domains of glutamate receptors and more accurately map the boundaries of the ligand binding domain.	1998 Dec	Chen G Q,Sun Y,Jin R,Gouaux E	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 7(12) 2623-30	Glutamate receptor 2	MHHHHHHHHSSGLVPRSGNDTSGLENKTVVVTTILESPYVMMKKNHEMLEGNERYEGYCVDLAAEIAKHCGFKYKLTIVGDGKYGARDADTKIWNGMVGELVYGKADIAIAPLTITLVREEVIDFSKPFMSLGISIMIKKPGTDGNPIESAEDLSKQTEIAYGTLDSGSTKEFFRRSKIAVFDKMWTYMRSAEPSVFVRTTAEGVARVRKSKGKYAYLLESTMNEYIEQRKPCDTMKVGGNLDSKGYGIATPKGSSLGNAVNLAVLKLNEQGLLDKLKNKWWYDKGECGS	Domains S1 and S2 joined by a 5-amino acid linker (GTDGN),N-terminal poly-histidine tag	P19491			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t
16103115	A binding site tyrosine shapes desensitization kinetics and agonist potency at GluR2. A mutagenic, kinetic, and crystallographic study.	Binding of an agonist to the 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor family of the glutamate receptors (GluRs) results in rapid activation of an ion channel. Continuous application results in a non-desensitizing response for agonists like kainate, whereas most other agonists, such as the endogenous agonist (S)-glutamate, induce desensitization. We demonstrate that a highly conserved tyrosine, forming a wedge between the agonist and the N-terminal part of the bi-lobed ligand-binding site, plays a key role in the receptor kinetics as well as agonist potency and selectivity. The AMPA receptor GluR2, with mutations in Tyr-450, were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and characterized in a two-electrode voltage clamp setup. The mutation GluR2(Y450A) renders the receptor highly kainate selective, and rapid application of kainate to outside-out patches induced strongly desensitizing currents. When Tyr-450 was substituted with the larger tryptophan, the (S)-glutamate desensitization is attenuated with a 10-fold increase in steady-state/peak currents (19compared with 1.9% at the wild type). Furthermore, the tryptophan mutant was introduced into the GluR2-S1S2J ligand binding core construct and co-crystallized with kainate, and the 2.1-A x-ray structure revealed a slightly more closed ligand binding core as compared with the wild-type complex. Through genetic manipulations combined with structural and electrophysiological analysis, we report that mutations in position 450 invert the potency of two central agonists while concurrently strongly shaping the agonist efficacy and the desensitization kinetics of the AMPA receptor GluR2.	2005 Oct	Holm Mai Marie,Naur Peter,Vestergaard Bente,Geballe Matthew T,Gajhede Michael,Kastrup Jette S,Traynelis Stephen F,Egebjerg Jan	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(42) 35469-76	Glutamate receptor 2	MHHHHHHHHSSGLVPRSGNDTSGLENKTVVVTTILESPYVMMKKNHEMLEGNERYEGYCVDLAAEIAKHCGFKYKLTIVGDGKWGARDADTKIWNGMVGELVYGKADIAIAPLTITLVREEVIDFSKPFMSLGTDGNQTEIAYGTLDSGSTKEFFRRSKIAVFDKMWTYMRSAEPSVFVRTTAEGVARVRKSKGKYAYLLESTMNEYIEQRKPCDTMKVGGNLDSKGYGIATPKGSSLGNAVNLAVLKLNEQGLLDKLKNKWWYDKGECGS	Domains S1 and S2 joined by a 5-residue linker (GTDGN),N-terminal poly-histidine tag	P19491		Ligand binding domain	8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
15677561	Fusion proteins comprising annexin V and Kunitz protease inhibitors are highly potent thrombogenic site-directed anticoagulants.	The anionic phospholipid, phosphatidyl-L-serine (PS), is sequestered in the inner layer of the plasma membrane in normal cells. Upon injury, activation, and apoptosis, PS becomes exposed on the surfaces of cells and sheds microparticles, which are procoagulant. Coagulation is initiated by formation of a tissue factor/factor VIIa complex on PS-exposed membranes and propagated through the assembly of intrinsic tenase (factor VIIIa/factor IXa), prothrombinase (factor Va/factor Xa), and factor XIa complexes on PS-exposed activated platelets. We constructed a novel series of recombinant anticoagulant fusion proteins by linking annexin V (ANV), a PS-binding protein, to the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI) domain of tick anticoagulant protein, an aprotinin mutant (6L15), amyloid beta-protein precursor, or tissue factor pathway inhibitor. The resulting ANV-KPI fusion proteins were 6- to 86-fold more active than recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor and tick anticoagulant protein in an in vitro tissue factor-initiated clotting assay. The in vivo antithrombotic activities of the most active constructs were 3- to 10-fold higher than that of ANV in a mouse arterial thrombosis model. ANV-KPI fusion proteins represent a new class of anticoagulants that specifically target the anionic membrane-associated coagulation enzyme complexes present at sites of thrombogenesis and are potentially useful as antithrombotic agents.	2005 May	Chen Hsiu-Hui,Vicente Cristina P,He Li,Tollefsen Douglas M,Wun Tze-Chein	Blood. 105(10) 3902-9	Annexin 5A	AYNRLCIKPRDWIDECDSNEGGERAYFRNGKGGCDSFWICPEDHTGADYYSSYRDCFNACIGSAQVLRGTVTDFPGFDERADAETLRKAMKGLGTDEESILTLLTSRSNAQRQEISAAFKTLFGRDLLDDLKSELTGKFEKLIVALMKPSRLYDAYELKHALKGAGTNEKVLTEIIASRTPEELRAIKQVYEEEYGSSLEDDVVGDTSGYYQRMLVVLLQANRDPDAGIDEAQVEQDAQALFQAGELKWGTDEEKFITIFGTRSVSHLRKVFDKYMTISGFQIEETIDRETSGNLEQLLLAVVKSIRSIPAYLAETLYYAMKGAGTDDHTLIRVMVSRSEIDLFNIRKEFRKNFATSLYSMIKGDTSGDYKKALLLLAGEDD	Tick anti-coagulant peptide UniProt: TAP_ORNMO, fused to ANV by 2-residue linker Gly-Ser	P08758			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8029799	Refold and characterization of recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor expressed in Escherichia coli.	Human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) was expressed in E. coli as a non-glycosylated protein with an additional alanine attached to the aminoterminus of the wild type molecule. High-level expression was obtained with pMON6875, a plasmid containing a tac promoter, Gene 10 leader from bacteriophage T7, methionine-alanine-TFPI coding sequence, and the p22 transcriptional terminator. In this system, TFPI accounted for about 5-100f the total cell protein. The inclusion bodies containing. TFPI were sulfitolyzed, purified by anion-exchange chromatography, refolded through a disulfide interchange reaction, and further fractionated by Mono S cation exchange chromatography. The Mono S resin resolved a peak of highly active TFPI from relatively inactive and possibly misfolded molecules. The E. coli TFPI was shown to be about two-fold more active, on a molar basis, than full-length human SK hepatoma TFPI in a tissue factor-induced clotting assay in human plasma.	1994 Mar	Diaz-Collier J A,Palmier M O,Kretzmer K K,Bishop B F,Combs R G,Obukowicz M G,Frazier R B,Bild G S,Joy W D,Hill S R	Thrombosis and haemostasis. 71(3) 339-46	Tissue factor pathway inhibitor	MADSEEDEEHTIITDTELPPLKLMHSFCAFKADDGPCKAIMKRFFFNIFTRQCEEFIYGGCEGNQNRFESLEECKKMCTRDNANRIIKTTLQQEKPDFCFLEEDPGICRGYITRYFYNNQTKQCERFKYGGCLGNMNNFETLEECKNICEDGPNGFQVDNYGTQLNAVNNSLTPQSTKVPSLFEFHGPSWCLTPADRGLCRANENRFYYNSVIGKCRPFKYSGCGGNENNFTSKQECLRACKKGFIQRISKGGLIKTKRKRKKQRVKIAYEEIFVKNM	A single extra Ala residue at start of sequence, remaining from signal sequence - wild-type mature sequence starts at DSEEDEE	P10646			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

16040169	Oral immunization with a shiga toxin B subunit: rotavirus NSP4(90) fusion protein protects mice against gastroenteritis.	A fusion protein containing the shiga toxin-1 B subunit (STB) linked to a 90 amino acid peptide (aa residues 86--175) from simian rotavirus (SA--11) nonstructural protein NSP4 was synthesized in Escherichia coli. Mice orally inoculated with 60 microg of STB::NSP4(90) fusion protein per dose generated higher humoral and intestinal antibody titers than mice inoculated with 30 microg of NSP4 alone. Serum anti-NSP4 IgG2a isotype titers were substantially greater than IgG1 titers, suggesting a dominant Th1 immune response. ELISA measurement of cytokines secreted from splenocytes isolated from immunized mice confirmed the STB::NSP4(90) fusion protein stimulation of a strong Th1 cell mediated immune response. Diarrhea in SA-11 rotavirus challenged neonates suckling from STB::NSP4 immunized dams was significantly reduced in severity and duration in comparison with virus challenged neonates from unimmunized mice. Together, our experiments demonstrate for the first time that the shiga toxin B subunit provides ligand mediated delivery of virus antigens to the gut-associated lymphoid tissues for enhanced stimulation of humoral and cellular responses against rotavirus gastroenteritis.	2005 Oct	Choi Nak-Won,Estes Mary K,Langridge William H R	Vaccine. 23(44) 5168-76	Shiga toxin 1 B subunit	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDRWGSETPDCVTGKVEYTKYNDDDTFTVKVGDKELFTNRWNLQSLLLSAQITGMTVTIKTNACHNGGGFSEVIFRGPGPKEQITTKDEIEKQMDRVVKEMRRQLEMIDKLTTREIEQVELLKRIYDKLTVQTTGEIDMTKEINQKNVRTLEEWESGKNPYEPREVTAAM	Simian Rotavirus Nonstructural protein (NSP4) UniProt ID:O92323_9REOV, residues 86-175.Linker between the two proteins: Gly Pro Gly Pro,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q7WZI6		aa.21-89	8.3	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15932882	Biophysical characterization of the interaction domains and mapping of the contact residues in the XPF-ERCC1 complex.	XPF and ERCC1 exist as a heterodimer to be stable and active in cells and catalyze DNA cleavage on the 5&#39;-side of a lesion during nucleotide excision repair. To characterize the specific interaction between XPF and ERCC1, we expressed the human ERCC1 binding domain of XPF (XPF-EB) and the XPF binding domain of ERCC1 (ERCC1-FB) in Escherichia coli. Milligram quantities of a heterodimer were characterized with gel filtration chromatography, an Ni(2+)-NTA binding assay, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Cross-linking experiments at high salt concentrations revealed that XPF interacts with ERCC1 mainly through hydrophobic interactions. XPF-EB was also shown to homodimerize in the absence of ERCC1. NMR cross-saturation methods were applied to map the residues involved in formation of the XPF-EB.XPF-EB homodimer and the XPF-EB.ERCC1-FB heterodimer. Helix H3 and the C-terminal region of XPF-EB were either within or in close proximity to the homodimer interface, whereas the ERCC1-FB binding site of XPF-EB was distributed across helix H1, a small part of H2, H3, and the C-terminal region, most of which exhibited large changes in chemical shift upon ERCC1 binding. The XPF-EB heterodimeric interface is larger than the XPF-EB homodimeric one, which could explain why XPF has a stronger affinity for ERCC1 than for a second molecule of XPF. The XPF binding sites of ERCC1 were located in helices H1 and H3 and in the C-terminal region, similar to the involved surface of XPF. We used cross-saturation data and the crystal structure of related proteins to model the two complexes.	2005 Aug	Choi Yun-Jeong,Ryu Kyoung-Seok,Ko Yun-Mi,Chae Young-Kee,Pelton Jeffrey G,Wemmer David E,Choi Byong-Seok	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(31) 28644-52	ERCC1	MEKLEQDFVSRVTECLTTVKSVNKTDSQTLLTTFGSLEQLIAASREDLALCPGLGPQKARRLFDVLHEPFLKVP		P07992		C-terminal XPF-binding domain (aa.224-297) 	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	t	f	f

Native and derivative data were collected for two of the cysteine mutants as well as for wild-type VEGF.	1996 Nov	Christinger H W,Muller Y A,Berleau L T,Keyt B A,Cunningham B C,Ferrara N,de Vos A M	Proteins. 26(3) 353-7	Vascular endothelial growth factor	GQNHHEVVKFMDVYQRSYCHPIETLVDIFQEYPDEIEYIFKPSCVCLMRCGGCCNDEGLECVPTEESNITMQIMRIKPHQGQHIGEMSFLQHNKCECRPKKD	3 intrachain disulfide bonds, 2 interchain disulfide bonds between dimer subunits	P15692		receptor binding domain, aa.8-109	8.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t
7878054	Site-directed mutagenesis studies of the high-affinity streptavidin-biotin complex: contributions of tryptophan residues 79, 108, and 120.	We report the functional characterization of site-directed biotin binding-site mutants of recombinant core streptavidin. The mutagenesis studies were aimed at characterizing the contributions of Trp residues known to contact biotin that have been postulated to control the exceptional binding affinity observed in this system. The functional properties of single site-directed mutants replacing Trp residues with Phe or Ala at positions 79, 108, and 120 were investigated by quantitating the EC50 binding parameters of these mutants to biotin and 2-iminobiotin in an ELISA format. The biotin EC50 for all mutants was the same as wild-type streptavidin, demonstrating that their delta Ka values relative to wild type were &lt; 10(6). The conservative W79F and W108F mutants displayed only a 2- to 3-fold increase in EC50 for 2-iminobiotin, corresponding to an estimated delta Ka &lt; 10, while the W120F mutant displayed a much greater alteration in 2-iminobiotin EC50, corresponding to an estimated delta Ka of 10(2). These delta Ka values are likely to reflect similar changes for biotin. The 2-iminobiotin EC50 values for the Ala mutants fell outside the accessible concentration range of the ELISA assay, demonstrating that these mutations lowered the Ka by a factor of 10(4) to 10(6). Direct estimation of biotin Ka values for W79A, W120A, and W120F in an ultrafiltration binding assay yielded Ka values of 4.3 x 10(7) M-1, 8.6 x 10(6) M-1, and &gt; 5 x 10(9) M-1, respectively, in excellent agreement with the ELISA estimates of delta Ka with 2-iminobiotin as a reporter ligand. The results of these preliminary functional studies suggest that these aromatic side chains contribute significantly to the streptavidin-biotin binding free energy.	1995 Feb	Chilkoti A,Tan P H,Stayton P S	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 92(5) 1754-8	Streptavidin	DPSKDSKAQVSAAEAGITGTWYNQLGSTFIVTAGADGALTGTYESAVGNAESRYVLTGRYDSAPATDGSGTALGWTVAWKNNYRNAHSATTWSGQYVGGAEARINTQWLLTSGTTEANAWKSTLVGHDTFTKVKPSAASIDAAKKAGVNNGNPLDAVQQ		P22629			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

9568892	Thermodynamic and structural consequences of flexible loop deletion by circular permutation in the streptavidin-biotin system.	A circularly permuted streptavidin (CP51/46) has been designed to remove the flexible polypeptide loop that undergoes an open to closed conformational change when biotin is bound. The original termini have been joined by a tetrapeptide linker, and four loop residues have been removed, resulting in the creation of new N- and C-termini. Isothermal titration calorimetric studies show that the association constant has been reduced approximately six orders of magnitude below that of wild-type streptavidin to 10(7) M(-1). The deltaH degrees of biotin association for CP51/46 is reduced by 11.1 kcal/mol. Crystal structures of CP51/46 and its biotin complex show no significant alterations in the binding site upon removal of the loop. A hydrogen bond between Ser45 and Ser52 found in the absence of biotin is broken in the closed conformation as the side-chain hydroxyl of Ser45 moves to hydrogen bond to a ureido nitrogen of biotin. This is true in both the wild-type and CP51/46 forms of the protein, and the hydrogen bonding interaction might thus help nucleate closure of the loop. The reduced entropic cost of binding biotin to CP51/46 is consistent with the removal of this loop and a reduction in entropic costs associated with loop closure and immobilization. The reduced enthalpic contribution to the free energy of binding is not readily explainable in terms of the molecular structure, as the binding contacts are nearly entirely conserved, and only small differences in solvent accessible surfaces are observed relative to wild-type streptavidin.	1998 Apr	Chu V,Freitag S,Le Trong I,Stenkamp R E,Stayton P S	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 7(4) 848-59	Streptavidin	ESRYVLTGRYDSAPATDGSGTALGWTVAWKNNYRNAHSATTWSGQYVGGAEARINTQWLLTSGTTEANAWKSTLVGHDTFTKVKPSAASGGGSDPSKDSKAQVSAAEAGITGTWYNQLGSTFIVTAGADGALTGTYESA		P22629		core protein, aa.13-139	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
11009596	Biochemical and biophysical characterization of OmpG: A monomeric porin.	A recombinant form of the porin OmpG, OmpGm, lacking the signal sequence, has been expressed in Escherichia coli. After purification under denaturing conditions, the protein was refolded in the detergent Genapol X-080, where it gained a structure rich in beta sheet as evidenced by a CD spectrum similar to that of the native form. Electrophoretic analysis and limited proteolysis experiments suggested that refolded OmpGm exists in at least three forms. Nevertheless, the recombinant protein formed uniform channels in planar bilayers with a conductance of 0.81 nS (1 M NaCl, pH 7.5). Previous biochemical studies had suggested that OmpG is a monomeric porin, rather than the usual trimer. Bilayer recordings substantiated this proposal; voltage-induced closures occurred consistently in a single step, and channel block by Gd(3+) lacked the cooperativity seen with the trimeric porin OmpF. The availability of milligram amounts of a monomeric porin will be useful both for basic studies of porin function and for membrane protein engineering.	2000 Oct	Conlan S,Zhang Y,Cheley S,Bayley H	Biochemistry. 39(39) 11845-54	Outer membrane protein G	MEERNDWHFNIGAMYEIENVEGYGEDMDGLAEPSVYFNAANGPWRIALAYYQEGPVDYSAGKRGTWFDRPELEVHYQFLENDDFSFGLTGGFRNYGYHYVDEPGKDTANMQRWKIAPDWDVKLTDDLRFNGWLSMYKFANDLNTTGYADTRVETETGLQYTFNETVALRVNYYLERGFNMDDSRNNGEFSTQEIRAYLPLTLGNHSVTPYTRIGLDRWSNWDWQDDIEREGHDFNRVGLFYGYDFQNGLSVSLEYAFEWQDHDEGDSDKFHYAGVGVNYSF		P76045			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f

15642474	Expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant cyanovirin-N for vaginal anti-HIV microbicide development.	Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) is a prokaryotic protein under development as a topical anti-HIV microbicide, an urgent and necessary approach to prevent HIV transmission in at-risk populations worldwide. We have expressed recombinant CV-N as inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. A purification scheme has been developed that exploits the physicochemical properties of this protein, in particular its stability in a harsh inclusion body purification scheme. Under the conditions developed, this system yields 140 mg of highly purified CV-N per liter of high-density cell culture, which represents a 14-fold increase over the best recombinant CV-N yield reported to date. This purification scheme results in monomeric CV-N as analyzed by SDS-PAGE, isoelectric focusing, and reverse phase- and size exclusion-HPLC. This recombinantly expressed and refolded CV-N binds to gp120 with nanomolar affinity and retains its potent anti-HIV activities in cell-based assays. The expression and purification system described herein provides a better means for the mass production of CV-N for further microbicide development.	2005 Feb	Colleluori Diana M,Tien Deborah,Kang Feirong,Pagliei Tara,Kuss Ryan,McCormick Timothy,Watson Karen,McFadden Karyn,Chaiken Irwin,Buckheit Robert W,Romano Joseph W	Protein expression and purification. 39(2) 229-36	Cyanovirin-N	MLGKFSQTCYNSAIQGSVLTSTCERTNGGYNTSSIDLNSVIENVDGSLKWQPSNFIETCRNTQLAGSSELAAECKTRAQQFVSTKINLDDHIANIDGTLKYEHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P81180			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
10397837	Expression, reactivation, and purification of enzymes from Haloferax volcanii in Escherichia coli.	Enzymes from extreme halophiles have potential as catalysts in biotransformations. We have developed methods for the expression in Escherichia coli and purification of two enzymes from Haloferax volcanii: dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase and citrate synthase. Both enzymes were expressed in E. coli using the cytoplasmic expression vectors, pET3a and pET3d. Citrate synthase was soluble and inactive, whereas dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase was expressed as inclusion bodies. Citrate synthase was reactivated following overnight incubation in 2 M KCl, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase was refolded by solubilisation in 8 M urea followed by dilution into a buffer containing 2 M KCl, 10 microM FAD, 1 mM NAD, and 0.3 mM GSSG/3 mM GSH. Maximal activity was obtained after 3 days incubation at 4 degrees C. Purification of the two active enzymes was carried out using high-resolution methods. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase was purified using copper-based metal ion affinity chromatography in the presence of 2 M KCl. Citrate synthase was recovered using dye-affinity chromatography in the presence of salt. A high yield of active enzyme was obtained in both cases. Following purification, characterisation of both recombinant proteins showed that their kinetics and salt-dependence were comparable to those of the native enzymes. Expression of active protein was attempted both by growth of E. coli in the presence of salt and betaine, and also by using periplasmic expression vectors in combination with a high salt growth media. Neither strategy was successful.	1999 Jul	Connaris H,Chaudhuri J B,Danson M J,Hough D W	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 64(1) 38-45	Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase	MVVGDIATGTELLVIGAGPGGYVAAIRAAQNGIDTTLVEKDAYGGTCLNYGCIPSKALITGANLAHEAGNAEEMGIHADPVVDMSQLRDWKSGVVDQLTGGVEKLCKANGVNLVEGTARFKDENAVRIAHGGEGQGSETIEFEHCIIATGSRVIQIPGFDFGDEPVWSSRDALEADTVPERLVVVGGGYIGMELSTTFAKLGADVTVVEMLDDILPGYESDVARVVRKRAEELGIDMHLGEGATGWREEDDGIMVTTETEDGEENEYRADKVLVAVGRSPVTDTMDIENAGLEADDRGFLSVDDRRRTDVEHIYAVGDVVEDTPMLAHVASKEGIVAAEHVAGEPVAFDSQAVPAAVFTDPEIGTVGMTEADAEEAGFTPVVGQMPFRASGRALTTNHADGFVRVVADEESGFVLGAQIVGPEASELIAELAFAIEMGATLEDVASTIHTHPTLAEAVMEAAENALGQAIHTLNRIRLLTKPERKLSWLLPPLSNN		Q04829			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
1734961	Isolation and characterization of a stable activation intermediate of the lysosomal aspartyl protease cathepsin D.	Procathepsin D is the intracellular aspartyl protease precursor of cathepsin D, a major lysosomal enzyme. Procathepsin D is rapidly processed inside the cell, and, thus, examination of its proteolyic activation and structure has been difficult. To study this proenzyme, a nonglycosylated form of the human fibroblast procathepsin D was expressed in Escherichia coli, refold in vitro, and purified by affinity chromatography on pepstatinyl agarose. Sequence analysis of the refolded, autoactivated enzyme allowed determination of the autoproteolytic cleavage site. The sequence surrounding this cleavage site between residues LeuP26 and IleP27 (in the &quot;pro&quot; region) resembled the first cleavage site found during activation of other aspartyl proteases. Thus, the autoactivated procathepsin D is analogous to the pepsin activation intermediate, which has been termed pseudopepsin. The enzymatic activity, thermal and pH stability, and fluorescence spectra of pseudocathepsin D were compared to mature, predominantly two-chain, cathepsin D isolated from human placenta. The results indicated that pseudocathepsin D and mature enzyme have a similar Km toward a peptide substrate and cleave a protein substrate at identical sites. Temperature stability of the recombinant enzyme was similar to that of the tissue-derived enzyme. However, the recombinant enzyme had increased stability at low pH when compared to the glycosylated tissue-derived two-chain cathepsin D. Fluorescence spectra of the recombinant and tissue-derived enzymes were identical. Thus, the absence of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides and the presence of the remaining segment of propeptide did not significantly alter the structural and enzymatic properties of the enzyme.	1992 Feb	Conner G E,Richo G	Biochemistry. 31(4) 1142-7	ProCathepsin D	ALVRIPLHKFTSIRRTMSEVGGSVEDLIAKGPVSKYSQAVPAVTEGPIPEVLKNYMDAQYYGEIGIGTPPQCFTVVFDTGSSNLWVPSIHCKLLDIACWIHHKYNSDKSSTYVKNGTSFDIHYGSGSLSGYLSQDTVSVPCQSASSASALGGVKVERQVFGEATKQPGITFIAAKFDGILGMAYPRISVNNVLPVFDNLMQQKLVDQNIFSFYLSRDPDAQPGGELMLGGTDSKYYKGSLSYLNVTRKAYWQVHLDQVEVASGLTLCKEGCEAIVDTGTSLMVGPVDEVRELQKAIGAVPLIQGEYMIPCEKVSTLPAITLKLGGKGYKLSPEDYTLKVSQAGKTLCLSGFMGMDIPPPSGPLWILGDVFIGRYYTVFDRDNNRVGFAEAARL		P07339			8.7	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15802217	Overexpression of human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase in Escherichia coli: renaturation from guanidine-HCl and affinity for pyridoxal phosphate co-factor.	Alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase-1 (AGT) is a human liver peroxisomal enzyme whose deficiency results in, primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1), a fatal metabolic disease. AGT requires a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) co-factor in its active site. The AGT gene usually exists in one of two polymorphic forms, the major and minor alleles. We describe here an overexpression system for normal and mutant variants of human AGT in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. We have extracted functional AGT from inclusion bodies using guanidine-HCl. Denaturation and re-folding of the overexpressed AGT after guanidine-HCl treatment produces high yields of biologically active protein and provides a strategy for generating an apoenzyme to investigate PLP-binding. K(M)s for PLP were determined by reconstitution of the apoenzyme. Successful folding was independent of the presence of PLP. The K(M) for PLP for minor allele AGT was significantly higher than that for major allele AGT. This decreased affinity could be attributed to I340M, a polymorphism associated with the minor allele. G170R, located on the minor allele and the most common PH1 mutation, had no effect on the affinity for PLP. PH1 mutations, G41V and G41R, showed enhanced activity after re-folding. We suggest that the renaturation/re-folding and reconstitution strategies provide an approach for studying the maturation of AGT under optimal conditions and in isolation from cellular quality control and chaperoning processes. Furthermore, our data show that mutations with serious consequences in vivo may not be inherently catalytically inactive and may be rescuable.	2005 May	Coulter-Mackie Marion B,Lian Qun,Wong Steve G	Protein expression and purification. 41(1) 18-26	Alanine--glyoxylate aminotransferase	MHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSGMKETAAAKFERQHMDSPSLGTDDDDKAMASHKLLVTPPKALLKPLSIPNQLLLGPGPSNLPPRIMAAGGLQMIGSMSKDMYQIMDEIKEGIQYVFQTRNPLTLVISGSGHCALEAALVNVLEPGDSFLVGANGIWGQRAVDIGERIGARVHPMTKDPGGHYTLQEVEEGLAQHKPVLLFLTHGESSTGVLQPLDGFGELCHRYKCLLLVDSVASLGGTPLYMDRQGIDILYSGSQKALNAPPGTSLISFSDKAKKKMYSRKTKPFSFYLDIKWLANFWGCDDQPRMYHHTIPVISLYSLRESLALIAEQGLENSWRQHREAAAYLHGRLQALGLQLFVKDPALRLPTVTTVAVPAGYDWRDIVSYVIDHFDIEIMGGLGPSTGKVLRIGLLGCNATRENVDRVTEALRAALQHCPKKKL	A range of mutants also produced: P11L, I340M, G170R, G41R, G41V, G82E, K209R,N-terminal hexahistidine tag and Protein S peptide tag	P21549			7	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
1645734	Construction of deletion mutants of the Escherichia coli UvrA protein and their purification from inclusion bodies.	The functions of each of the three subunits of the damage-specific UvrABC endonuclease is currently being studied by systematically mutagenizing the corresponding genes to generate mutant proteins for characterization in vitro. In this communication, we describe the construction of C-terminal deletion mutants of the UvrA protein and a procedure to purify the mutant and wild-type UvrA proteins from inclusion bodies in cells overexpressing the recombinant proteins. The method yields highly purified proteins with between 10 and 500f the specific activity of wild-type UvrA purified by conventional techniques from the soluble fraction. The wild-type UvrA protein purified by this method had the properties of significant and selective loss of activity in assays of incision of damaged DNA, while still retaining high levels of the other unique molecular phenotypic properties associated with intact UvrA. Furthermore, the demonstration of the absolute requirement for zinc during refolding for recovery of activity is the first evidence that the zinc previously shown to be associated with the UvrA protein is in fact a necessary component for its function.	1991 Jun	Claassen L A,Ahn B,Koo H S,Grossman L	The Journal of biological chemistry. 266(17) 11380-7	UvrA Protein	MDKIEVRGARTHNLKNINLVIPRDKLIVVTGLSGSGKSSLAFDTLYAEGQRRYVESLSAYARQFLSLMEKPDVDHIEGLSPAISIEQKSTSHNPRSTVGTITEIHDYLRLLFARVGEPRCPDHDVPLAAQTVSQMVDNVLSQPEGKRLMLLAPIIKERKGEHTKTLENLASQGYIRARIDGEVCDLSDPPKLELQKKHTIEVVVDRFKVRDDLTQRLAESFETALELSGGTAVVADMDDPKAEELLFSANFACPICGYSMRELEPRLFSFNNPAGACPTCDGLGVQQYFDPDRVIQNPELSLAGGAIRGWDRRNFYYFQMLKSLADHYKFDVEAPWGSLSANVHKVVLYGSGKENIEFKYMNDRGDTSIRRHPFEGVLHNMERRYKETESSAVREELAKFISNRPCASCEGTRLRREARHVYVENTPLPAISDMSIGHAMEFFNNLKLAGQRAKIAEKILKEIGDRLKFLVNVGLNYLTLSRSAETLSGGEAQRIRLASQIGAGLVGVMYVLDEPSIGLHQRDNERLLGTLIHLRDLGNTVIVVEHDEDAIRAADHVIDIGPGAGVHGGEVVAEGPLEAIMAVPESLTGQYMSGKRKIEVPKKRVPANPEKVLKLTGARGNNLKDVTLTLPVGLFTCITGVSGSGKSTLINDTLFPIAQRQLNGATIAEPAPYRDIQGLEHFDKVIDIDQSPIGRTPRSNPATYTGVFTPVRELFAGVPESRARGYTPGRFSFNVRGGRCEACQGDGVIKVEMHFLPDIYVPCDQCKGKRYNRETLEIKYKGKTIHEVLDMTIEEAREFFDAVPALARKLQTLMDVGLTYIRLGQSATTLSGGEAQRVKLARELSKRGTGQTLYILDEPTTGLHFADIQQLLDVLHKLRDQGNTIVVIEHNLDVIKTADWIVDLGPEGGSGGGEILVSGTPETVAECEASHTARFLKPML		P0A698			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

8157636	Probing the retinol-binding site of bovine beta-lactoglobulin.	The retinol-binding site of beta-lactoglobulin has been located by selective modification of amino acid residues which reside in the two putative binding sites. Based upon two separate crystallographic analyses of bovine beta-lactoglobulin, different binding sites for retinol have been proposed: one proposal favors an interior cavity, the other a surface cleft. To discriminate between these two models, we have made four separate site-directed mutations introducing a W19A or a K70M in the interior pocket and a F136A or K141M in the surface pocket. The K70M beta-lactoglobulin exhibited a marked decrease in its binding of retinoic acid compared to the F136A, K141M, and wild-type proteins. Retinyldenepropylamine, a retinyl Schiff base analog of retinol, was synthesized and its absorption spectrum when bound to the wild-type, K70M, and K141M proteins was examined to probe its interaction with the respective lysine residues. The retinylidenepropylamine bound in the K70M beta-lactoglobulin exhibited a kinetic red shift as distinct from the blue shift observed when it is bound to either the K141M or wild-type beta-lactoglobulins. The blue shift indicates protonation of the Schiff base. The resulting tagged peptide was isolated after cyanogen bromide cleavage and found to be the Ala25-Met107 peptide, consistent with the Lys70 being the residue which interacts with the bound retinol. These results support the proposal that retinol binds to an evolutionarily conserved interior cavity rather than the surface pocket.	1994 Apr	Cho Y,Batt C A,Sawyer L	The Journal of biological chemistry. 269(15) 11102-7	Beta-lactoglobulin A	LIVTQTMKGLDIQKVAGTWYSLAMAASDISLLDAQSAPLRVYVEELKPTPEGDLEILLQKWENDECAQKKIIAEKTKIPAVFKIDALNENKVLVLDTDYKKYLLFCMENSAEPEQSLVCQCLVRTPEVDDEALEKFDKALKALPMHIRLSFNPTQLEEQCHI	mutants K70M, F136A and K141M also made	P02754			8	22	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	f
16233521	Protein refolding in nanostructured reversed micelles including a molecular chaperone.	Reversed micelles including the molecular chaperone GroEL were applied to the protein refolding of denatured RNase A. The molecular chaperone was successfully functionalized in the water pools of the reversed micelles sharing a structural size of 15-25 nm. The refolding yield of RNase A in the reversed-micelle/GroEL system was much greater than that of spontaneous renaturation. The refolding yield mediated by GroEL in the reversed micelles was strongly dependent on the presence of ATP or Mg2+, suggesting that the GroEL hosted in the reversed micelles was biologically active in the micelles. Under the optimum conditions, this novel refolding technique could completely renature the denatured RNase A in 1 h.	2003 	Sakono Masafumi,Ichinose Hirofumi,Goto Masahiro	Journal of bioscience and bioengineering. 96(3) 275-8	Ribonuclease A	KETAAAKFERQHMDSSTSAASSSNYCNQMMKSRNLTKDRCKPVNTFVHESLADVQAVCSQKNVACKNGQTNCYQSYSTMSITDCRETGSSKYPNCAYKTTQANKHIIVACEGNPYVPVHFDASV		P61823			8.5	30	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15830945	Controlled oxidative protein refolding using an ion-exchange column.	Column-based refolding of complex and highly disulfide-bonded proteins simplifies protein renaturation at both preparative and process scale by integrating and automating a number of operations commonly used in dilution refolding. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a model protein for refolding and oxido-shuffling on an ion-exchange column to give a refolding yield of 55% after 40 h incubation. Successful on-column refolding was conducted at protein concentrations of up to 10 mg/ml and refolded protein, purified from misfolded forms, was eluted directly from the column at a concentration of 3 mg/ml. This technique integrates the dithiothreitol removal, refolding, concentration and purification steps, achieving a high level of process simplification and automation, and a significant saving in reagent costs when scaled. Importantly, the current result suggests that it is possible to controllably refold disulfide-bonded proteins using common and inexpensive matrices, and that it is not always necessary to control protein-surface interactions using affinity tags and expensive chromatographic matrices. Moreover, it is possible to strictly control the oxidative refolding environment once denatured protein is bound to the ion-exchange column, thus allowing precisely controlled oxido-shuffling.	2005 Apr	Langenhof Marc,Leong Susanna S J,Pattenden Leonard K,Middelberg Anton P J	Journal of chromatography.

8003962	Real-time DNA binding measurements of the ETS1 recombinant oncoproteins reveal significant kinetic differences between the p42 and p51 isoforms.	The sequence-specific DNA binding of recombinant p42 and p51 ETS1 oncoprotein was examined quantitatively to determine whether the loss of the Exon VII phosphorylation domain in p42 ETS1 or the phosphorylation of expressed Exon VII in p51 ETS1 had an effect on DNA binding activity. The kinetics of sequence-specific DNA binding was measured using real-time changes in surface plasmon resonance with BIAcore (registered trademark, Pharmacia Biosensor) technology. The real-time binding of p42 and p51 ETS1 displayed significant differences in kinetic behavior. p51 ETS1 is characterized by a fast initial binding and conversion to a stable complex, whereas p42 ETS1 exhibits a slow initial binding and conversion to a stable complex. All of the p51 ETS1 DNA binding states are characterized by rapid turnover, whereas the p42 ETS1 DNA binding states are 4-20 times more stable. A model describing these kinetic steps is presented. Stoichiometric titrations of either p42 or p51 ETS1 with specific oligonucleotides show 1:1 complex formation. The DNA sequence specificity of the p42 and p51 ETS1 as determined by mutational analysis was similar.

8003962	Real-time DNA binding measurements of the ETS1 recombinant oncoproteins reveal significant kinetic differences between the p42 and p51 isoforms.	The sequence-specific DNA binding of recombinant p42 and p51 ETS1 oncoprotein was examined quantitatively to determine whether the loss of the Exon VII phosphorylation domain in p42 ETS1 or the phosphorylation of expressed Exon VII in p51 ETS1 had an effect on DNA binding activity. The kinetics of sequence-specific DNA binding was measured using real-time changes in surface plasmon resonance with BIAcore (registered trademark, Pharmacia Biosensor) technology. The real-time binding of p42 and p51 ETS1 displayed significant differences in kinetic behavior. p51 ETS1 is characterized by a fast initial binding and conversion to a stable complex, whereas p42 ETS1 exhibits a slow initial binding and conversion to a stable complex. All of the p51 ETS1 DNA binding states are characterized by rapid turnover, whereas the p42 ETS1 DNA binding states are 4-20 times more stable. A model describing these kinetic steps is presented. Stoichiometric titrations of either p42 or p51 ETS1 with specific oligonucleotides show 1:1 complex formation. The DNA sequence specificity of the p42 and p51 ETS1 as determined by mutational analysis was similar. The in vitro phosphorylation of p51 ETS1 by CAM kinase II obliterates its binding to specific DNA, suggesting that the regulation of p51 ETS1 sequence-specific DNA binding occurs through phosphorylation by a calcium-dependent second messenger.

16337629	Plasmodium falciparum: biochemical characterization of the cysteine protease falcipain-2&#39;.	The Plasmodium falciparum cysteine proteases falcipain-2 and falcipain-3 are hemoglobinases and potential antimalarial drug targets. The falcipain-2&#39; gene was identified recently and is nearly identical in sequence to falcipain-2. The product of this gene has not been studied previously. The mature protease domain of falcipain-2&#39; was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and refolded to active enzyme. Functional analysis revealed similar biochemical properties to those of falcipain-2, including pH optima (pH 5.5-7.0), reducing requirements, and substrate preference. Studies with cysteine protease inhibitors showed similar inhibition of falcipain-2 and falcipain-2&#39;, although specificities were not identical. Considering activity against the presumed biological substrate, both enzymes readily hydrolyzed hemoglobin. Our results confirm that falcipain-2&#39; is an active hemoglobinase and suggest that falcipain-2 and falcipain-2&#39; play similar roles in erythrocytic parasites but that, for promising cysteine protease inhibitors, it will be important to confirm activity against this additional target.	2006 Mar	Singh Naresh,Sijwali Puran S,Pandey Kailash C,Rosenthal Philip J	Experimental parasitology. 112(3) 187-92	Falcipain-2(prime)	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPSSRFADLTYHEFKSKYLTLRSSKPLKNSKYLLDQINYDAVIKKYKGNENFDHAAYDWRLHSGVTPVKDQKNCGSCWAFSSIGSVESQYAIRKNKLITLSEQELVDCSFKNYGCNGGLINNAFEDMIELGGICTDDDYPYVSDAPNLCNIDRCTEKYGIKNYLSVPDNKLKEALRFLGPISISIAVSDDFPFYKEGIFDGECGDELNHAVMLVGFGMKEIVNPLTKKGEKHYYYIIKNSWGQQWGERGFINIETDESGLMRKCGLGTDAFIPLIE	Mature protease domain, 271a.a. long,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q56CY9			9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
11035724	A protective glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein of Plasmodium yoelii trophozoites and merozoites contains two epidermal growth factor-like domains.	Using sera from mice immunized and protected against Plasmodium yoelii malaria, we identified a novel blood-stage antigen gene, pypag-2. The 2.1-kb pypag-2 cDNA contains a single open reading frame that encodes a 409-amino-acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 46.8 kDa. Unlike many characterized plasmodial antigens, blocks of tandemly repeated amino acids are lacking in the pypAg-2 protein sequence. Recombinant pypAg-2, comprising the full-length protein minus the predicted N-terminal signal and C-terminal anchor sequences, was produced and used to raise a high-titer polyclonal rabbit antiserum. This antiserum was used to identify and characterize the native protein through immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. Consistent with the presence of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, pypAg-2 fractionated with the detergent phase of Triton X-114-solubilized proteins and could be metabolically labeled with [(3)H]palmitic acid. By immunofluorescence, pypAg-2 expression was localized to both the trophozoite and merozoite membranes. Similar to Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein 1, pypAg-2 contains two C-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. Most importantly, immunization with recombinant pypAg-2 protected mice against lethal P. yoelii malaria. Thus, pypAg-2 is a target of protective immune responses and represents a novel addition to the family of merozoite surface proteins that contain one or more EGF-like domains.	2000 Nov	Burns J M,Belk C C,Dunn P D	Infection and immunity. 68(11) 6189-95	Merozoite surface protein 8	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMGNCNENGNGNINKANNNSIIRKERKRKSKSDFSKGEPENKEHEIINLYDDVQELLGPDEMNMLDKYSILGIDDCSNENENNKIISEYDLKAMKSVLLYKNRISRASINNLDDVKTVFKRCFNKDDPELSKSYEQIQNQVANEGTTIIDYLSNYISNIYIKINDEFVKNEEFQLSKYIPELEIINYVLYNGPKEIGNKIKNELIEINNLIISESLTSIYSSVVSGLNINCKIKDDLITILNLANGKYFKVNFSSQATMIIPEQYSHESEHMKKISEYFIEKNRVCKNENCPINSNCYVIDSVETCRCIPGFSKNEESENLECLINESTSCENNNGGCDVNANCILLEDKIMCECNNKFNGDGIYCS	Full sequence of mature protein except for C-terminal anchor sequence,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9GSA3			8.3	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16135515	Dissection of merozoite surface protein 3, a representative of a family of Plasmodium falciparum surface proteins, reveals an oligomeric and highly elongated molecule.	Vaccination with the merozoite surface protein 3 (MSP3) of Plasmodium falciparum protects against infection in primates and is under development as a vaccine against malaria in humans. MSP3 is secreted and associates with the parasite membrane but lacks a predicted transmembrane domain or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Its role in the invasion of red blood cells is unclear. To study MSP3, we produced recombinant full-length protein and found by size exclusion chromatography that the apparent size of MSP3 was much larger than predicted from its sequence. To investigate this, we used several biophysical techniques to characterize the full-length molecule and four smaller polypeptides. The MSP3 polypeptides contain a large amount of alpha-helix and random coil secondary structure as measured by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The full-length MSP3 forms highly elongated dimers and tetramers as revealed by chemical cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation. The dimer is formed through a leucine zipper-like domain located between residues 306 and 362 at the C terminus. Two dimers interact through their C termini to form a tetramer with an apparent association constant of 3 mum. Sedimentation velocity experiments determined that the MSP3 molecules are highly extended in solution (some with f/f(0) &gt; 2). These data, in light of the recent discoveries of three other Plasmodium proteins containing very similar C-terminal sequences, suggest that the members of this newly identified family may adopt highly extended and oligomeric novel structures capable of interacting with a red blood cell at relatively long distances.	2005 Nov	Burgess Brandt R,Schuck Peter,Garboczi David N	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(44) 37236-45	Merezoite surface protein 3	HHHHHHMNNVASKEIVKKYNLNLRNAILNNNSQIENEEKDIKYELNEQNDENVNTPIVGNSMEFGGFTADDEKDMEAYKKAKEASQDAEKAAEEAEKAAEQAEQASKDAEKLKESDESYTKAKEACTAASKVKKAFETASNAKKAAESALKTNETGERNSRNNFYTTKTKEYAGKVEKDYERAKNAYQKANQAVLKAKEASSYDYILGWEFGGGVPEHKKEENMLSHLAVSSKDKENISKENDDVLDEKEEEAEETEEEELEEKNEEETESEISEDEEEEEEEEEEKEEENDKKKEQEKEQSNENNDQKKDMEAQNLISKNQNNNEKNVKEAAESIMKTLAGLIKGNNQIDSTLKDLVEELSKYFKNH	Y223A mutation inserted to avoid protease cleavageForms both dimers and tetramers,N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q95PI5			7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f

10775410	Efficient production of recombinant brazzein, a small, heat-stable, sweet-tasting protein of plant origin.	Brazzein is a 54-amino-acid sweet-tasting protein first isolated from the fruit of Pentadiplandra brazzeana Baillon found in West Africa. Brazzein, as isolated from the fruit, is 500 times sweeter than sucrose on a weight basis (9500 times sweeter on a per-molecule basis). A minor component of brazzein from fruit, des-pGlu1-brazzein, has 53 amino acid residues and has twice the sweetness of the parent protein. We have designed a gene for des-pGlu1- brazzein that incorporates codons that are optimal for protein production in Escherichia coli. Production of brazzein from the chemically synthesized gene resulted in recombinant protein with sweetness similar to that of brazzein isolated from the original source. The best yields were achieved by producing brazzein as a fusion with staphylococcal nuclease with a designed cyanogen bromide cleavage site. Because of its intense sweetness and stability at high pH and temperature, brazzein is an ideal system for investigating the chemical and structural requirements involved in sweet-taste properties. This efficient protein production system for brazzein will facilitate such investigations.	2000 Apr	Assadi-Porter F M,Aceti D J,Cheng H,Markley J L	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 376(2) 252-8	Brazzein	ATSTKKLHKEPATLIKAIDGDTVKLAYKGQPATFRLLLVDTPETKHPKKGVEKYGPEASAFTKKAVENAKKIEVEFDKGQRTDKYGRGLAYIYADGKAVNEALVRQGLAKVAYVYKPNNTHEQHLRKSEAQAKKEKLNIWSEDNADSGHMDKCKKVYENYPVSKCQLANQCNYDCKLDKHARSGECFYDEKRNLQCICDYCEY	Fusion partner: staphylococcal nuclease UniProt: NUC_STAAU, mature protein with Met residues mutated to AlaBrazzein sequence lacks N-terminal Glu residue,N-terminal staphylococcal nuclease	P56552			3.9	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f
10545205	Biochemical characterization of the heteromeric Bacillus subtilis dihydroorotate dehydrogenase and its isolated subunits.	Bacillus subtilis dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHOD) consists of two subunits, PyrDI (M(r) = 33,094) and PyrDII (M(r) = 28,099). The two subunits were overexpressed jointly and individually and purified. PyrDI was an FMN-containing flavoprotein with an apparent native molecular mass of 85,000. Overexpressed PyrDII formed inclusion bodies and was purified by refolding and reconstitution. Refolded PyrDII bound 1 mol FAD and 1 mol [2Fe-2S] per mol PyrDII. Coexpression and purification of PyrDI and PyrDII yielded a native holoenzyme complex with an apparent native molecular mass of 114,000 that indicated a heterotetramer (PyrDI(2)PyrDII(2)). The holoenzyme possessed dihydroorotate:NAD(+) oxidoreductase activity and could also reduce menadione and artificial dyes. Purified PyrDI also possessed DHOD activity but could not reduce NAD(+). Compared to PyrDI, the holoenzyme had a more than 20-fold smaller K(m) value for dihydroorotate, an approximately 50-fold smaller K(i) value for orotate, and approximately 500-fold greater catalytic efficiency. Dihydroorotate:NAD(+) oxidoreductase activity could be recovered by mixing the purified subunits. Recovered activity showed a clear dependence on FAD reconstitution of PyrDII but not on reconstitution with FeS clusters. PyrDII had a strong preference for FAD over FMN and bound it with an estimated K(d) value of 4.9 +/- 0.8 nM. pyrDII mutants containing alanine substitutions of the cysteine ligands to the [2Fe-2S] cluster failed to complement the pyr bradytrophy of a DeltapyrDII strain, indicating a requirement for the FeS cluster in PyrDII for normal function in vivo.	1999 Nov	Kahler A E,Nielsen F S,Switzer R L	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 371(2) 191-201	Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase	MKKAYLTVCSNQQIADRVFQMVLKGELVQGFTTPGQFLHLKVSEAVTPLLRRPISIADVNFEKNEVTIIYRVDGEGTRLLSLKQQGELVDVLGPLGNGFPVNEVQPGKTALLVGGGVGVPPLQELSKRLIEKGVNVIHVLGFQSAKDVFYEEECRQYGDTYVATADGSYGETGFVTDVIKRKKLEFDILLSCGPTPMLKALKQEYAHKEVYLSMEERMGCGIGACFACVCHTNESETSYVKVCLDGPVFKAQEVAL					8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9172774	Refolding, purification, and characterization of human erythropoietin binding protein produced in Escherichia coli.	The extracellular domain of the human erythropoietin receptor (EPO binding protein (EBP)) has been expressed and overproduced in Escherichia coli. Regardless of the presence ofpelB or ompT signal sequences the recombinant protein produced in this fashion appears, as with many other recombinant eukaryotic proteins produced in E. coli as an insoluble product in laboratory scale fermentations. The induction product of the pelB protein expression system appears as two protein forms with slightly different molecular weights. Based on N-terminal sequence analysis of recovered protein, these forms represent two variants, one with the signal sequence properly processed to yield the expected &quot;native&quot; amino terminus and another which retains the signal sequence. Both forms appear as insoluble fermentation products. Control of oxygen levels and pH during high density fermentation allows the production of only the protein variant with the native amino terminus. Methods reported here permit the efficient recovery of purified EBP which quantitatively binds EPO in solution as determined by high performance size exclusion chromatography. A long-lived refolding intermediate was observed which penultimately collapses into an active conformation. The active purified protein competes with membrane associated EPO receptor for binding [125I]EPO and neutralizes EPO-dependent stimulation in a cell based proliferation assay. Further, the radioligand equilibrium binding constant for this interaction has been determined by immobilizing EBP on agarose gel via a free cysteine. The production of EBP by these methods should facilitate the structural determination of the protein by NMR or crystallography and may serve as a guide for the refolding of other hematopoietic receptors.	1996 Feb	Johnson D L,Middleton S A,McMahon F,Barbone F P,Kroon D,Tsao E,Lee W H,Mulcahy L S,Jolliffe L K	Protein expression and purification. 7(1) 104-13	Erythropoietin Receptor	PPPNLPDPKFESKAALLAARGPEELLCFTERLEDLVCFWEEAASAGVGPGNYSFSYQLEDEPWKLCRLHQAPTARGAVRFWCSLPTADTSSFVPLELRVTAASGAPRYHRVIHINEVVLLDAPVGLVARLADESGHVVLRWLPPPETPMTSHIRYEVDVSAGNGAGSVQRVEILEGRTECVLSNLRGRTRYTFAVRARMAEPSFGGFWSAWSEPVSLLTPSDLDPSGC		P19235			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
15477092	Purification, folding, and characterization of Rec12 (Spo11) meiotic recombinase of fission yeast.	Meiotic recombination is initiated by controlled dsDNA breaks (DSBs). Rec12 (Spo11) protein of fission yeast is essential for the formation of meiotic DSBs in vivo, for meiotic recombination, and for segregation of chromosomes during meiosis I. Rec12 is orthologous to Top6A topoisomerase of Archaea and is likely the catalytic subunit of a meiotic recombinase that introduces recombinogenic DSBs. However, despite intensive effort, it has not been possible to produce Rec12 protein in a soluble form required to permit biochemical analyses of function. To obtain purified Rec12 protein for in vitro studies, a rec12(+) cDNA was generated, cloned into vector pET15b(+), and expressed in Escherichia coli. Rec12 protein was produced at moderate levels and it partitioned into insoluble fractions of whole-cell extracts. The protein was enriched based upon its differential solubility in two different denaturants and was further purified by column chromatography. A combinatorial, fractional, factorial approach was used to identify conditions under which Rec12 protein could be refolded. Four parameters were most important and, following optimization, soluble Rec12 protein was obtained. Gel filtration demonstrated that refolded Rec12 protein exists as a monomer in solution, suggesting that additional proteins may be required to assemble biologically-active Rec12 dimers, as inferred previously from genetic data [Cell Chromosome 1 (2002) 1]. The production of refolded Rec12 in a soluble form will allow for characterization in vitro of this key meiotic recombination enzyme.	2004 Nov	Wu Heng,Gao Jun,Sharif Wallace D,Davidson Mari K,Wahls Wayne P	Protein expression and purification. 38(1) 136-44	Rec12 meiotic recombinase	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMMNSNDKKKVVRSWIEQFVHDFVEQLSKPTKDSVNVALKRRKHNSWNGSLDSKANERQKVKVFSFPRNETTIAQLFRVLDCVHEAVISDTVITKRDIYYRDVDLFKRQTVVDELLGDISNTIGCSRSDLNVEASAKGLVFGSIHIALENGTVITATKPLLISHHRISSITSTAKWVLVIEKEAVFQTLTEEALADTIIVTAKGFPDLMTRKFLVKLAKALPDAKFFGIFDWDPHGLCIYSCFKYGSNAYSHEPHSQLRNLQLLGPLYEDIFNKNQEFSLKLNKRDIKMITTLLQFEGFQKEPVVREQLQRMLFIQKKAEIQAILEFPSWIKGKLADADKSGKHSVR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P40384			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f

The cDNA encoding the A chain of beta-bungarotoxin (beta-Bgt) was constructed from the cellular RNA isolated from the venom glands of Bungarus multicinctus (Taiwan banded krait). The deduced amino acid sequence encoding the A chain revealed that the determined one was different from the known A chains (A1, A2, A3 and A4). Nevertheless, the amino acid sequence and cDNA sequence of the new A chain (A5) was highly homologous with those of other A chains. The A5 chain was subcloned into the expression vector pT7-7 and transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli strain. The expressed protein was isolated from the inclusion bodies of E. coli, and the refolded A chain was purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purified recombinant A chain exhibited an about 16d0c850hospholipase activity of beta-Bgt. These results strongly suggest that the A chain is an active subunit responsible for the phospholipase activity of beta-Bgt.	1996 Apr	Chang L S,Wu P F,Chang C C	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 221(2) 328-32	Beta-bungarotoxin A5 chain	MNLYQFKEMIRYTIPCEKTWGEYADYGCYCGAGGSGRPIDALDRCCYVHDNCYGDAEKKHKCNPKTQSYSYKLTKRTIICYGAAGTCGRIVCDCDRTTALCFGNSEYIEGHKNIDTARFCQ		P59018			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
14965763	Production of recombinant CART peptides in Escherichia coli with agonist and antagonist effects on food intake in rats.	CART (Cocaine- and Amphetamine-Regulated Transcript) peptides modulate food intake and psychostimulant drug actions. Several CART peptides that contain multiple disulfide bonds were produced by overexpression in Escherichia coli bacteria as fusion products with a C-terminal histidine tag. Since these peptides were found denatured in inclusion bodies, in vitro refolding was used to reconstitute their biological activity. These CART peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit food intake in rats. Of recombinant rat CART peptides 1-102 long, 1-102 short, and 55-102, only CART peptide 55-102 dose-dependently inhibited neuropeptide Y stimulated food intake in rats. This effect was dependent on refolding of the peptide since the unfolded version was unable to inhibit food intake.

14965763	Production of recombinant CART peptides in Escherichia coli with agonist and antagonist effects on food intake in rats.	CART (Cocaine- and Amphetamine-Regulated Transcript) peptides modulate food intake and psychostimulant drug actions. Several CART peptides that contain multiple disulfide bonds were produced by overexpression in Escherichia coli bacteria as fusion products with a C-terminal histidine tag. Since these peptides were found denatured in inclusion bodies, in vitro refolding was used to reconstitute their biological activity. These CART peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit food intake in rats. Of recombinant rat CART peptides 1-102 long, 1-102 short, and 55-102, only CART peptide 55-102 dose-dependently inhibited neuropeptide Y stimulated food intake in rats. This effect was dependent on refolding of the peptide since the unfolded version was unable to inhibit food intake.

16125410	Expression and purification of human antimicrobial peptide, dermcidin, in Escherichia coli.	Human dermcidin, an anionic antimicrobial peptide expressed in the pons of the brain and the sweat glands, displays antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms such as Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Here, we describe the recombinant production of a 48 amino acid dermcidin variant with C-terminal homoserine lactone (DCD-1Hsl). Dermcidin coding sequence was cloned downstream of a 125 amino acid ketosteroid isomerase gene and upstream of a His6Tag sequence in pET-31b(+) vector and transformed into Escherichia coli. The fusion protein was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies, purified on His Bind Resin, and cleaved by CNBr to release recombinant DCD-1Hsl. Purification of rDCD-1Hsl was achieved by solid-phase extraction that yielded milligram amounts of peptide with more than 95d0c850urity. Recombinant peptide showed antimicrobial activities against E. coli ML-35p, Salmonella typhimurium 5156, Listeria monocytogenes 264, S. aureus 29/58 (clinical isolate), and C. albicans K2 (clinical strain). The application of this expression/purification approach represents a fast and efficient method to prepare milligram quantities of dermcidin in its biologically active form.	2006 Feb	Cipáková Ingrid,Gasperík Juraj,Hostinová Eva	Protein expression and purification. 45(2) 269-74	Dermcidin	HTPEHITAVVQRFVAALNAGDLDGIVALFADDATVEDPVGSEPRSGTAAIREFYANSLKLPLAVELTQEVRAVANEAAFAFTVSFEYQGRKTVVAPIDHFRFNGAGKVVSIRALFGEKNIHACQMSSLLEKGLDGAKKAVGGLGKLGKDAVEDLESVGKGAVHDVKDVLDSVMLLEHHHHHH	Full length mature sequence with fusion tagsMonomeric and undefined multimeric forms (30-40%) present,N-terminal KSI sequence, C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P81605			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7893937	Characterization of polyketide ketoreductase gene (MPKR) from midecamycin-producing strain (Streptomyces mycarofaciens 1748).	This paper presents the results about the expression of the polyketide ketoreductase gene from midecamycin-producing strain (S. mycarofaciens 1748), gene localization and nucleotide sequences analysis. A BamHI-BamHI 4.0 kg fragment isolated from a genomic library of midecamycin-producing strains containing the actIII homologous DNA was inserted into E. coli-Streptomyces shuttle vector pWHM3. A recombinant plasmid pCB4 was obtained and introduced into a 2-hydroxyaklavinone producer S. galilaeus ATCC 31671 that was a polyketide ketoreductase gene deficient mutant. The transformant produced aklavinone according to TLC and HPLC analyses. The BamHI-BamHI 4.0-kb fragment was inserted into pWHM3 in the reverted orientation with pCB4 and a recombinant plasmid pCBR4 was obtained. Introduction pCBR4 into S. galilaeus ATCC 31671 also resulted in the production of aklavinone. Thus we demonstrated that this gene encoded a polyketide ketoreductase which results in deoxygenation of 2-hydroxyaklavinone in C-2 position and that this gene has its own promoter. Restriction map analysis of pCB4 indicated that there were no sites for EcoRI and HindIII, but there were sites for BssHII, SalI, SphI and XhoI on the cloned gene fragment. The polyketide ketoreductase gene was located on a BssHII-BamHI 1.3-kb fragment from Southern hybridization result, using actIII gene as a probe, and that was confirmed by gene expression in S. galilaeus ATCC 31671. The nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the BssHII-BamHI 1.3-kb fragment contained an open reading frame (ORF). The protein coding region was assumed to start with an ATG start codon, end at an TAG stop codon. There was a 5nt (GGAGG) SD sequence at the upstream of start codon. A presumptive promoter consisted of 7 nt AACCGGA at the -10 region and 5 nt TTCGA at the -35 region. The deduced amino acid sequences of MPKR gene consisted of 261 aa residues. Its amino acid were compared with actIII gene coding protein sequences. The similarity was 77.4% and the identity was 66.7%.	1994 	Xia H,Wang Y,Sun J	Chinese journal of biotechnology. 10(3) 169-78	Single chain Fv MabA34, specific for human apolipoprotein A-I	DVLMTQTPLSLPVSLGDQASISCRSSQSIVHTNGNTYLEWYLQKPGQSPKLLIYKVSNRFSGVPDRFSGSGSGTDFTLKISRVEAEDLGVYYCFQGSHVPRTFGGGTKLEIKRADAAPTVSIFPPSSEQLTSGGASVVCFLNNFYPKDINVKWKIDGSERQNGVLNSWTDQDSKDSTYSMSSTLTLTKDEYERHNSYTCEATHKTSTSPIVKSFNRNECGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSEVQLVESGAELMKPGASVKISCKATDYRFSSYWIEWVKQRPGHGLEWIGDILPGSGNTNYNERFKGKATFTADTSSNTAYMQLSSLTSEDSAVYYCAIPDYWGQGTTLTVSSAKTTPPSVYPLAPGSAAQTNSMVTLGCLVKGYFPEPVTVTWNSGSLSSGVHTFPAVLQSDLYTLSSSVTVPSSPRPSETVTCNVAHPASSTKVDKKIVPRDC	Variable regions light and heavy chains linked,  connected by (Gly4Ser)3 linker				8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15975577	A role for complexes of survival of motor neurons (SMN) protein with gemins and profilin in neurite-like cytoplasmic extensions of cultured nerve cells.	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by reduced levels of SMN (survival of motor neurons protein) and consequent loss of motor neurons. SMN is involved in snRNP transport and nuclear RNA splicing, but axonal transport of SMN has also been shown to occur in motor neurons. SMN also binds to the small actin-binding protein, profilin. We now show that SMN and profilin II co-localise in the cytoplasm of differentiating rat PC12 cells and in neurite-like extensions, especially at their growth cones. Many components of known SMN complexes were also found in these extensions, including gemin2 (SIP-1), gemin6, gemin7 and unrip (unr-interacting protein). Coilin p80 and Sm core protein immunoreactivity, however, were seen only in the nucleus. SMN is known to associate with beta-actin mRNA and specific hnRNPs in axons and in neurite extensions of cultured nerve cells, and SMN also stimulates neurite outgrowth in cultures. Our results are therefore consistent with SMN complexes, rather than SMN alone, being involved in the transport of actin mRNPs along the axon as in the transport of snRNPs into the nucleus by similar SMN complexes. Antisense knockdown of profilin I and II isoforms inhibited neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells and caused accumulation of SMN and its associated proteins in cytoplasmic aggregates. BIAcore studies demonstrated a high affinity interaction of SMN with profilin IIa, the isoform present in developing neurons. Pathogenic missense mutations in SMN, or deletion of exons 5 and 7, prevented this interaction. The interaction is functional in that SMN can modulate actin polymerisation in vitro by reducing the inhibitory effect of profilin IIa. This suggests that reduced SMN in SMA might cause axonal pathfinding defects by disturbing the normal regulation of microfilament growth by profilins.	2005 Sep	Sharma Aarti,Lambrechts Anja,Hao Le Thi,Le Thanh T,Sewry Caroline A,Ampe Christophe,Burghes Arthur H M,Morris Glenn E	Experimental cell research. 309(1) 185-97	Profilin I	MAGWNAYIDNLMADGTCQDAAIVGYKDSPSVWAAVPGKTFVNITPAEVGVLVGKDRSSFYVNGLTLGGQKCSVIRDSLLQDGEFSMDLRTKSTGGAPTFNVTVTKTDKTLVLLMGKEGVHGGLINKKCYEMASHLRRSQY		P07737			8.1	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

16143544	Cloning, expression, and purification of C-terminal quarter of the heavy chain of botulinum neurotoxin type A.	Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are highly potent toxins that inhibit neurotransmitter release from peripheral cholinergic synapses. BoNTs consist of a toxifying light chain (LC; 50 kDa) and a binding-translocating heavy chain (HC; 100 kDa) linked through a disulfide bond. The complete sequence of BoNT/A consists of 1296 amino acid residues. The beta-trefoil domain for BoNT/A to which gangliosides bind starts at Ser 1092 and this fragment represents the C-half of the C-terminus of the heavy chain (C-quarter HC or HCQ). The recombinant HCQ DNA was successfully cloned into an expression vector (pET15b), which was used to transform Escherichia coli strain BL21-Star (DE3) for expression. Expression of HCQ was obtained by an extended post-induction time of 15 h at 30 degrees C. The recombinant histidine tagged HCQ protein was isolated and purified by nickel affinity gel column chromatography and its molecular weight was verified by gel electrophoresis. The HCQ was positively identified by antibodies raised against BoNT/A employing immunological dot-blot and Western blot assays. HCQ was shown to bind with synaptotagmin (a known BoNT/A receptor) and gangliosides, indicating that the expressed and purified HCQ protein retains a functionally active conformation.	2006 Feb	Sharma Sapna,Zhou Yu,Singh Bal Ram	Protein expression and purification. 45(2) 288-95	Botulinum neurotoxin type A	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMMSNSGILKDFWGDYLQYDKPYYMLNLYDPNKYVDVNNVGIRGYMYLKGPRGSVMTTNIYLNSSLYRGTKFIIKKYASGNKDNIVRNNDRVYINVVVKNKEYRLATNASQAGVEKILSALEIPDVGNLSQVVVMKSKNDQGITNKCKMNLQDNNGNDIGFIGFHQFNNIAKLVASNWYNRQIERSSRTLGCSWEFIPVDDGWGERPLDPAANKARKEAELAAATAEQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q7B8V4			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

As a new member of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (Apo2L/TRAIL) was produced mainly as inclusion bodies by recombinant Escherichia coli with a temperature-inducible expression system. High concentrations of both biomass (65 g dry cells l(-1)) and inactive TRAIL (4.8 g l(-1)) were obtained by applying a high-cell-density cultivation procedure. After the inclusion bodies were washed and solubilized. TRAIL refolded when at 1 mg ml(-1) by a simple pulse dilution method with a 35% yield. Renatured TRAIL was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by one-step immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified TRAIL showed strong cytotoxicity activity against human pancreatic 1990 tumor cells, with ED50 about 1.6 microg ml(-1).	2003 Dec	Shen Ya-Ling,Xia Xiao-Xia,Zhang Yue,Liu Jian-Wen,Wei Dong-Zhi,Yang Sheng-Li	Biotechnology letters. 25(24) 2097-101	TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand	MAMMEVQGGPSLGQTCVLIVIFTVLLQSLCVAVTYVYFTNELKQMQDKYSKSGIACFLKEDDSYWDPNDEESMNSPCWQVKWQLRQLVRKMILRTSEETISTVQEKQQNISPLVRERGPQRVAAHITGTRGRSNTLSSPNSKNEKALGRKINSWESSRSGHSFLSNLHLRNGELVIHEKGFYYIYSQTYFRFQEEIKENTKNDKQMVQYIYKYTSYPDPILLMKSARNSCWSKDAEYGLYSIYQGGIFELKENDRIFVSVTNEHLIDMDHEASFFGAFLVG	No fusion tag stated, but a Ni-NTA purification step performed	P50591			7.4	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15908099	An adenylyl cyclase pseudogene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has a functional ortholog in Mycobacterium avium.	A number of genes similar to mammalian Class III nucleotide cyclases are found in mycobacteria, and biochemical characterization of some of these proteins has indicated that they code for adenylyl cyclases, with properties similar to the mammalian enzymes. Our earlier bioinformatic analysis had predicted that the Rv1120c gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a pseudogene, while analysis of the genome of Mycobacterium avium indicated the presence of a functional ortholog. We therefore cloned and expressed Rv1120c and its ortholog from M. avium, Ma1120, in Escherichia coli, and find that while the protein from M. tuberculosis is misfolded and found in inclusion bodies, Ma1120 is expressed to high levels as a functional adenylyl cyclase. Sequence analysis of Ma1120 indicates interesting variations in critical amino acids that are known to be important for catalytic activity. Ma1120 is maximally active in the presence of MnATP as substrate ((app)Km approximately 400 microM), and is inhibited by P-site inhibitors (IC50 of 2&#39;,5&#39;-dideoxy-3&#39;-adenosine triphosphate approximately 730 nM) and tyrphostins (IC50 approximately 36 microM) in a manner similar to the mammalian enzymes. This therefore represents the first Class III cyclase biochemically characterized from M. avium, and the absence of a functional ortholog in M. tuberculosis suggests a unique role for this enzyme in M. avium.	2005 Jun	Shenoy A R,Srinivas A,Mahalingam M,Visweswariah S S	Biochimie. 87(6) 557-63	RV1120c (hypothetical protein)	SGGREAVKTVWQTANLVRKEGFGAAVRSSIEDPADWAEVERPDLARVTPDGRVVILFSDIEESTALDERIGDRTWVKLIGAHDKLVHELVRRWSGHMVTSQGDGFMIAFARAEQAVRCGIDIQDALRNSAKRKRNQGIRVRIGTTWGARCGTVTICSAATSQ	unclear as to whether there are flanking sequences from the vector	O06572			8.2	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

Glucocorticoid induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR) is a new member of the tumor necrosis factor-nerve growth factor receptor superfamily of which the function has not been well studied. The extracellular domain of GITR was produced in Escherichia coli and purified as a single band of predicted M(r) of 18.0 kDa. GITR and GITR ligand were expressed constitutively on the surface of Raw 264.7 macrophage cell line and murine peritoneal macrophages. An extracellular domain of GITR can activate murine macrophages to express inducible nitric oxide synthase and to generate nitric oxide in a dose- and time-dependent manner.	2002 Mar	Shin Hyun Hee,Lee Moo Hyung,Kim Suk Gi,Lee Yun Hwa,Kwon Byoung S,Choi Hye Seon	FEBS letters. 514(2-3) 275-80	Glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMQPSVVEEPGCGPGKVQNGSGNNTRCCSLYAPGKEDCPKERCICVTPEYHCGDPQCKICKHYPCQPGQRVESQGDIVFGFRCVACAMGTFSAGRDGHCRLWTNCSQFGFLTMFPGNKTHNAVCIPEPLPTEQYGRAPPPPPPLRSGC	N-terminal hexahistidine tag				8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9325268	Human low density lipoprotein receptor fragment. Successful refolding of a functionally active ligand-binding domain produced in Escherichia coli.	The low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor plays a key role in cholesterol homeostasis, mediating cellular uptake of lipoprotein particles by high affinity binding to its ligands, apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 and apoE. The ligand-binding domain of the LDL receptor contains 7 cysteine-rich repeats of approximately 40 amino acids; each repeat contains 6 cysteines, which form 3 intra-repeat disulfide bonds. As a first step toward determining the structure of the LDL receptor, both free and bound to its ligands, we produced in Escherichia coli a soluble fragment containing the ligand-binding domain (residues 1-292) as a thrombin-cleavable, heat-stable thioredoxin fusion. Modest amounts (5 mg/liter) of partially purified but inactive fragment were obtained after cell lysis, heat treatment, thrombin cleavage, and gel filtration under denaturing conditions. We were able to refold the receptor fragment to an active conformation with approximately 10 0.000000e+00fficiency. The active fragment was isolated and purified with an LDL affinity column. The refolded receptor fragment was homogeneous, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate or non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. The purified fragment did not react with fluorescein-5-maleimide, indicating that all 42 cysteines were disulfide linked. In addition, the refolded fragment exhibited properties identical to those of the intact native receptor: Ca2+-dependent binding and isoform-dependent apoE binding (apoE2 binding &lt;50f apoE3). Furthermore, antibodies to the fragment recognized native receptors and inhibited the binding of 125I-LDL to fibroblast LDL receptors. We conclude that we have produced a properly folded and fully active receptor fragment that can be used for further structural studies.	1997 Oct	Simmons T,Newhouse Y M,Arnold K S,Innerarity T L,Weisgraber K H	The Journal of biological chemistry. 272(41) 25531-6	Low density lipoprotein receptor	GSAVGDRCERNEFQCQDGKCISYKWVCDGSAECQDGSDESQETCLSVTCKSGDFSCGGRVNRCIPQFWRCDGQVDCDNGSDEQGCPPKTCSQDEFRCHDGKCISRQFVCDSDRDCLDGSDEASCPVLTCGPASFQCNSSTCIPQLWACDNDPDCEDGSDEWPQRCRGLYVFQGDSSPCSAFEFHCLSGECIHSSWRCDGGPDCKDKSDEENCAVATCRPDEFQCSDGNCIHGSRQCDREYDCKDMSDEVGCVNVTLCEGPNKFKCHSGECITLDKVCNMARDCRDWSDEPIKEC	N-terminal thioredoxin + hexahistidine tag	P01130			9	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12962478	Human recombinant resistin protein displays a tendency to aggregate by forming intermolecular disulfide linkages.	Resistin, a small cysteine rich protein secreted by adipocytes, has been proposed to be a link between obesity and type II diabetes by modulating the insulin signaling pathway and thus inducing insulin resistance. Resistin protein, with 11 cysteine residues, was not significantly homologous at the amino acid level to any other known cysteine rich proteins. Resistin cDNA derived from human subcutaneous adipose tissue was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal six-His-tag fusion protein. The overexpressed recombinant resistin was purified to homogeneity from inclusion bodies, after solubilization in 8 M urea, using a metal affinity column. While MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein generated a single peak corresponding to the estimated size of 11.3 kDa, the protein exhibited a concentration-dependent oligomerization which is evident from size exclusion chromatography. The oligomeric structure was SDS-insensitive but beta-mercaptoethanol-sensitive, pointing to the importance of disulfide linkages in resistin oligomerization. Estimation of free cysteine residues using the NBD-Cl assay revealed a concentration- and time-dependent increase in the extent of formation of disulfide linkages. The presence of intermolecular disulfide bond(s), crucial in maintaining the global conformation of resistin, was further evident from fluorescence emission spectra. Circular dichroism spectra revealed that recombinant resistin has a tendency to reversibly convert from alpha-helical to beta-sheet structure as a direct function of protein concentration. Our novel observations on the biophysical and biochemical features of human resistin, particularly those shared with prion proteins, may have a bearing on its likely physiological function.	2003 Sep	Aruna Battu,Ghosh Sudip,Singh Anil K,Mande Shekhar C,Srinivas V,Chauhan Radha,Ehtesham Nasreen Z	Biochemistry. 42(36) 10554-9	Resistin	MRGSHHHHHHLCSMEEAINERIQEVAGSLIFRAISSIGLECQSVTSRGDLATCPRGFAVTGCTCGSACGSWDVRAETTCHCQCAGMDWTGARCCRVQP	Protein forms oligomers/aggregates, one potential/probable inter-chain disulfide bond formed between molecules,N-terminal hexahistidine tag				8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f
14697240	Dimerization of human recombinant resistin involves covalent and noncovalent interactions.	Resistin, an adipocyte secreted cysteine rich hormone has been implicated as molecular link between obesity and type 2 diabetes in a murine model. Although, at the protein level mouse and human resistin show remarkable similarities with respect to conserved cysteine residues, the physiological role of human resistin is not yet clear. In the present study we describe the purification and refolding of human recombinant resistin using two different refolding processes. Gel filtration analysis of protein refolded by both the methods revealed that human recombinant resistin, like mouse resistin, has a tendency to form dimers. Interestingly, dimerization of resistin appears to be mediated by both covalent (disulfide bond mediated) and non-covalent interactions as seen on reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Circular dichroism spectral analysis revealed that human resistin peptide backbone is a mixture of alpha-helical and beta-sheet conformation with significant amounts of unordered structure, similar to the mouse resistin. It is likely that the first cysteine (Cyst22) of human resistin, which is equivalent to mouse Cyst26, may be involved in stabilizing the dimers through covalent interaction.	2004 Jan	Raghu Pullakhandam,Ghosh Sudip,Soundarya Kanukolanu,Haseeb Abdul,Aruna Battu,Ehtesham Nasreen Z	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 313(3) 642-6	Resistin	MRGSHHHHHHLCSMEEAINERIQEVAGSLIFRAISSIGLECQSVTSRGDLATCPRGFAVTGCTCGSACGSWDVRAETTCHCQCAGMDWTGARCCRVQP	One inter-chain disulfide bond formed between molecules,N-terminal hexahistidine tag				8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
12814870	Production and characterization of bioactive recombinant resistin in Escherichia coli.	Type 2 diabetes, characterized by peripheral target tissue resistance to insulin, is epidemic in industrialized countries and is strongly associated with obesity. The protein hormone, resistin, secreted specifically by the adipose tissues, is found to antagonize insulin action upon glucose uptake and may serve as an important role between human obesity and insulin resistance. Here, we report the production of bioactive recombinant resistin in Escherichia coli. cDNA of resistin was obtained by RT-PCR from mRNA of mouse differentiated NIH/3T3-L1 cells. The cDNA of mature resistin was inserted in the pQE-31 vector and the recombinant plasmid was transferred into E. coli JM109. After IPTG induction, the rec. resistin found in the inclusion body was dissolved in 6 M guanidine-HCl in the presence of 10 mM beta-mercaptoethanol. The His-tag containing protein was purified by Ni-NTA column to 950mogeneity. After a quasi-static-like refolding process, the secondary structure of the rec. resistin was elucidated by circular dichroism which indicated that the protein was composed of 34.3% alpha-helix, 8.90eta-sheet, 23.40eta-turn, and 31.20nordered structure. No disulfide-linked homodimers were formed in SDS-PAGE analysis under non-reducing conditions. The rec. resistin showed a dose-dependent antagonizing action against insulin in [3H]-2-deoxy-glucose transport in a broad range from 1 ng ml(-1) to 10 microg ml(-1) of resistin. A suppression of 850f transport was achieved at the dosage of 10 microg ml(-1). This result may indicate that the rec. resistin does not need to form homodimers to establish its bioactivity. The rec. resistin will be useful for exploring the biological functions of this newly discovered hormone.	2003 Jun	Juan Chi-Chang,Kan Lou-Sing,Huang Cheng-Chih,Chen Shih-Shih,Ho Low-Tone,Au Lo-Chun	Journal of biotechnology. 103(2) 113-7	Resistin	MRGSHHHHHHTDPSSMPLCPIDEAIDKKIKQDFNSLFPNAIKNIGLNCWTVSSRGKLASCPEGTAVLSCSCGSACGSWDIREEKVCHCQCARIDWTAARCCKLQVAS	One inter-chain disulfide bond formed between molecules,N-terminal hexahistidine tag				8.8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
14697240	Dimerization of human recombinant resistin involves covalent and noncovalent interactions.	Resistin, an adipocyte secreted cysteine rich hormone has been implicated as molecular link between obesity and type 2 diabetes in a murine model. Although, at the protein level mouse and human resistin show remarkable similarities with respect to conserved cysteine residues, the physiological role of human resistin is not yet clear. In the present study we describe the purification and refolding of human recombinant resistin using two different refolding processes. Gel filtration analysis of protein refolded by both the methods revealed that human recombinant resistin, like mouse resistin, has a tendency to form dimers. Interestingly, dimerization of resistin appears to be mediated by both covalent (disulfide bond mediated) and non-covalent interactions as seen on reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Circular dichroism spectral analysis revealed that human resistin peptide backbone is a mixture of alpha-helical and beta-sheet conformation with significant amounts of unordered structure, similar to the mouse resistin. It is likely that the first cysteine (Cyst22) of human resistin, which is equivalent to mouse Cyst26, may be involved in stabilizing the dimers through covalent interaction.	2004 Jan	Raghu Pullakhandam,Ghosh Sudip,Soundarya Kanukolanu,Haseeb Abdul,Aruna Battu,Ehtesham Nasreen Z	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 313(3) 642-6	Resistin	MRGSHHHHHHLCSMEEAINERIQEVAGSLIFRAISSIGLECQSVTSRGDLATCPRGFAVTGCTCGSACGSWDVRAETTCHCQCAGMDWTGARCCRVQP	One inter-chain disulfide bond formed between molecules,N-terminal hexahistidine tag				8.8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
15596356	Expression, refolding, and purification of recombinant human granzyme B.	Granzyme B (GrB) is a member of a family of serine proteases involved in cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated killing of potentially harmful cells, where GrB induces apoptosis by cleavage of a limited number of substrates. To investigate the suitability of GrB as an enzyme for specific fusion protein cleavage, two derivatives of human GrB, one dependent on blood coagulation factor Xa (FXa) cleavage for activation and one engineered to be self-activating, were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Both derivatives contain a hexa-histidine affinity tag fused to the C-terminus and expressed as inclusion bodies. These were isolated and solubilized in guanidiniumHCl, immobilized on a Ni2+-NTA agarose column, and refolded by application of a cyclic refolding protocol. The refolded pro-rGrB-H6 could be converted to a fully active form by cleavage with FXa or, for pro(IEPD)-rGrB-H6, by autocatalytic processing during the final purification step. A self-activating derivative in which the unpaired cysteine of human GrB was substituted with phenylalanine was also prepared. Both rGrB-H6 and the C228F mutant were found to be highly specific and efficient processing enzymes for the cleavage of fusion proteins, as demonstrated by cleavage of fusion proteins containing the IEPD recognition sequence of GrB.	2005 Jan	Lorentsen Rikke H,Fynbo Charlotte H,Thøgersen Hans C,Etzerodt Michael,Holtet Thor L	Protein expression and purification. 39(1) 18-26	Granzyme B	MGSIEPDIIGGHEAKPHSRPYMAYLMIWDQKSLKRCGGFLIQDDFVLTAAHCWGSSINVTLGAHNIKEQEPTQQFIPVKRPIPHPAYNPKNFSNDIMLLQLERKAKRTRAVQPLRLPSNKAQVKPGQTCSVAGWGQTAPLGKHSHTLQEVKMTVQEDRKCESDLRHYYDSTIELCVGDPEIKKTSFKGDSGGPLVCNKVAQGIVSYGRNNGMPPRACTKVSSFVHWIKKTMKRYLNSHHHHHH	C-terminal hexahis + pro seq	P10144			8	10	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Human pancreatic ribonuclease, the homolog of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease, has a significant therapeutic potential. Its study has been hindered by the difficulty of obtaining the enzyme in a pure and homogeneous form, either from human source or using heterologous expression. Engineering of different variants of human pancreatic ribonuclease has allowed us to study and overcome some problems encountered during its heterologous production in an Escherichia coli system and its purification from inclusion bodies.

11162408	High-yield expression, purification, and characterization of the recombinant diisopropylfluorophosphatase from Loligo vulgaris.	Organophosphate degrading enzymes are of great interest in light of their ability to detoxify chemical warfare agents. The diisopropylfluorophosphatase (DFPase) from Loligo vulgaris is characterized by its high stability and broad substrate specifity. Here we report the production of large amounts of active, recombinant DFPase using an Escherichia coli expression system. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity using a combination of immobilized metal affinity and ion exchange chromatography. CD-spectroscopy indicates a well folded protein with a high amount of beta-sheet structure. Limited proteolysis was used to gain a deeper insight into the structural organization of the protein. DFPase possesses an internal protease-sensitive region located between amino acids 146 and 149. The two proteolytic fragments remain as a tight complex retaining a DFPase activity comparable to the intact enzyme. Overexpression clones for each fragment were constructed with the expression resulting in the formation of inclusion bodies. Upon isolation and refolding active protein is only formed when both fragments are present. Thus, the two proteolytic fragments are probably part of a stable single-domain protein with multiple contacts between them and only one protease accessible surface loop.	2001 Feb	Hartleib J,Rüterjans H	Protein expression and purification. 21(1) 210-9	Diisopropylfluorophosphatase	VAPADYTRSMQEKFGSIYCFTTDGQMIQVDTAFQFPNGIAVRHMNDGRPYQLIVAETPTKKLWSYDIKGPAKIENKKVWGHIPGTHEGGADGMDFDEDNNLLVANWGSSHIEVFGPDGGQPKMRIRCPFEKPSNLHFKPQTKTIFVTEHENNAVWKFEWQRNGKKQYCETLKFGIF		Q7SIG4			6.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
11272849	Direct expression of the extracellular portion of human FcepsilonRIalpha chain as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.	The extracellular portion of the alpha chain of the human high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRIalpha) was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. In immunoblot analysis, two bands were reactive to human IgE and mouse anti-human FcepsilonRIalpha monoclonal antibodies. N-terminal sequencing showed that the two bands were equivalent to the soluble FcepsilonRIalpha with a methionine residue at the N-terminus (Met-1-172) and 23-172, in which the N-terminal 22 residues of the soluble FcepsilonRIalpha have been removed, possibly by degradation in E. coli cells. IgE-binding to CHO cells expressing FcepsilonRI was inhibited by the addition of the recombinant products prepared by the refolding procedure from inclusion bodies. The system for the expression of soluble human FcepsilonRIalpha in E. coli presented in this study and its further improvement would be useful for the production of the protein as a potent therapeutic and for analysis of the IgE-FcepsilonRIalpha interaction.	2001 Jan	Takai T,Okumura K,Ra C	Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry. 65(1) 79-85	High affinity immunoglobulin epsilon alpha chain	VTLTCNGNNFFEVSSTKWFHNGSLSEETNSSLNIVNAKFEDSGEYKCQHQQVNESEPVYLEVFSDWLLLQASAEVVMEGQPLFLRCHGWRNWDVYKVIYYKDGEALKYWYENHNISITNATVEDSGTYYCTGKVWQLDYESEPLNITVIKA		P12319		Truncated extracellular domain aa.23-172	8.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12460770	Engineering S-protein fragments of bovine ribonuclease A for targeted drug delivery.	High affinity interaction between S-protein and S-peptide fragments of bovine pancreatic RNase A has been recently used for construction of molecular vehicles for targeted drug delivery. The vehicle is assembled as a complex of drug carrier conjugated S-protein with S-peptide-tagged targeting protein. To avoid random chemical crosslinking of drug carriers to S-protein, we constructed a mutant 16-124aa fragment of RNase A in which 122ala is replaced with a cysteine residue. The mutant and the corresponding wild type fragments expressed in Escherichia coli are refolded into functional conformations only in the presence of S-peptide. After the removal of S-peptide, both fragments retain the ability to bind S-peptide and S-peptide-tagged proteins. The 122cys residue in the mutant fragment is available for site-specific conjugation.	2002 Dec	Backer Marina V,Gaynutdinov Timur I,Aloise Renee,Przekop Kristen,Backer Joseph M	Protein expression and purification. 26(3) 455-61	Ribonuclease A	STSAASSSNYCNQMMKSRNLTKDRCKPVNTFVHESLADVQAVCSQKNVACKNGQTNCYQSYSTMSITDCRETGSSKYPNCAYKTTQANKHIIVACEGNPYVPVHFDCSV		P61823		Subtilisin digestion-based fragment aa.16-124	8.6	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12737851	Humanized docking system for assembly of targeting drug delivery complexes.	Targeted drug delivery requires &#39;loading&#39; drugs onto targeting proteins. Traditional technologies for loading drugs rely on chemical conjugation of drugs or drug carriers to targeting proteins. An alternative approach might rely on assembly of targeting complexes using a docking system that includes two components: a &#39;docking&#39; tag fused to a targeting protein, and a &#39;payload&#39; module containing an adapter protein for non-covalent binding to the docking tag. We describe here a fully humanized adapter/docking tag system based on non-covalent interaction between two fragments of human pancreatic RNase I. A 15 amino acid long N-terminal fragment of RNase I designed to serve as a docking tag, was fused to the N-terminus of human vascular endothelial growth factor that served as a targeting protein. An 18-125 and an 18-127 amino acid long fragments of RNase I were engineered, expressed and refolded into active conformations to serve as adapter proteins. Interactions between the targeting and adapter proteins were characterized using enzymatic analysis and surface plasmon resonance. Targeting DNA delivery complexes were assembled, characterized by dynamic light scattering, and found to be very effective in receptor-mediated DNA delivery.	2003 May	Backer Marina V,Gaynutdinov Timur I,Gorshkova Inna I,Crouch Robert J,Hu Tao,Aloise Renee,Arab Mohamed,Przekop Kristen,Backer Joseph M	Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society. 89(3) 499-511	Ribonuclease A	MSAASSSTYCNQMMRRRNMTQGRCKPVNTFVHEPLVDVQNVCFQEKVTCKNGQGNCYKSNSSMHITDCRLTNGSRYPNCAYRTSPKERHIIVACEGSPYVPVHFDASVE	P19A and S20A mutations to increase protein yield	P07998		HuS, aa.18-125	8.6	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8692965	Direct binding of a soluble natural killer cell inhibitory receptor to a soluble human leukocyte antigen-Cw4 class I major histocompatibility complex molecule.	Natural killer (NK) cells expressing specific p58 NK receptors are inhibited from lysing target cells that express human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C class I major histocompatibility complex molecules. To investigate the interaction between p58 NK receptors and HLA-Cw4, the extracellular domain of the p58 NK receptor specific for HLA-Cw4 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and refolded from purified inclusion bodies. The refolded NK receptor is a monomer in solution. It interacts specifically with HLA-Cw4, blocking the binding of a p58-Ig fusion protein to HLA-Cw4-expressing cells, but does not block the binding of a p58-Ig fusion protein specific for HLA-Cw3 to HLA-Cw3-expressing cells. The bacterially expressed extracellular domain of HLA-Cw4 heavy chain and beta2-microglobulin were refolded in the presence of a HLA-Cw4-specific peptide. Direct binding between the soluble p58 NK receptor and the soluble HLA-Cw4-peptide complex was observed by native gel electrophoresis. Titration binding assays show that soluble monomeric receptor forms a 1:1 complex with HLA-Cw4, independent of the presence of Zn2+. The formation of complexes between soluble, recombinant molecules indicates that HLA-Cw4 is sufficient for specific ligation by the NK receptor and that neither glycoprotein requires carbohydrate for the interaction.	1996 Jul	Fan Q R,Garboczi D N,Winter C C,Wagtmann N,Long E O,Wiley D C	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 93(14) 7178-83	p58 natural killer cell inhibitory receptor	HEGVHRKPSLLAHPGPLVKSEETVILQCWSDVMFEHFLLHREGMFNDTLRLIGEHHDGVSKANFSISRMTQDLAGTYRCYGSVTHSPYQVSAPSDPLDIVIIGLYEKPSLSAQPGPTVLAGENVTLSCSSRSSYDMYHLSREGEAHERRLPAGPKVNGTFQADFPLGPATHGGTYRCFGSFHDSPYEWSKSSDPLLVSVTGNPSNSWPSPTEPSSKTGNPRHLH	Two extracellular domain constructs expressed and refolded:2) sol-cl42H: a.a.1-224Number of amino acids: 224Molecular weight: 24608.4Theoretical pI: 6.26	P43626			8.3	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
2263618	Stability and activity of human immunodeficiency virus protease: comparison of the natural dimer with a homologous, single-chain tethered dimer.	A single-chain tethered dimer of human immunodeficiency virus protease (HIV-PR) was produced by expression of a synthetic gene in Escherichia coli. The tethered dimer, which consists of two 99-amino acid HIV-PR subunits linked together by a pentapeptide, was isolated from inclusion bodies and refolded as an active protease with enzymatic properties very similar to those of the natural dimer at pH 5.5. In addition to demonstrating that the tethered dimer is active, we have shown that the tethered dimer is more stable than the natural HIV-PR dimer at pH 7.0. This is attributed to dissociation of the natural HIV-PR dimer, for which a surprisingly high dissociation constant, 5 X 10(-8) M was measured. Furthermore, the tethered dimer offers an opportunity to produce asymmetric dimer mutants and thereby determine the effect of changes in one of the two subunits on protease activity. In one such mutant, a single active-site aspartic residue was changed to a glycine residue. This protein was inactive, consistent with a requirement for an aspartic residue from each subunit to constitute an active site of HIV-PR.	1990 Dec	Cheng Y S,Yin F H,Foundling S,Blomstrom D,Kettner C A	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 87(24) 9660-4	HIV protease	VTLWQRPLVTIKIGGQLKEALLGTGADDTVLEEMSLPGRWKPKMIGGIGGFIKVRQYDQILIEICGHKAIGTVLVGPTPVNIIGRNLLTQIGCTLNFPIGGSSGVTLWQRPLVTIKIGGQLKEALLDTGADDTVLEEMSLPGRWKPKMIGGIGGFIKVRQYDQILIEICGHKAIGTVLVGPTPVNIIGRNLLTQIGCTLNFPI	leader sequence auto-cleaved prior to unfolding and refolding	P03366			5.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Both p55-hGRF and p39-hGRF form dimers. We established a procedure to prepare and purify the complex with Ras.

9003368	Adenosylcobalamin-dependent glutamate mutase: properties of a fusion protein in which the cobalamin-binding subunit is linked to the catalytic subunit.	Adenosylcobalamin-dependent glutamate mutase (EC 5.4.99.1) from Clostridium tetanomorphum comprises two protein components, MutE and MutS. The formation of the holoenzyme is a kinetically complex process that involves the co-operative association of MutS, MutE and adenosylcobalamin. The MutS portion of the cobalamin-binding site is conserved within a group of adenosylcobalamin-dependent enzymes that catalyse similar isomerizations. However, in contrast with glutamate mutase, in these other enzymes the cobalamin-binding region represented by MutS is present as a C-terminal domain. We have investigated the effect on the structural and kinetic properties of glutamate mutase of linking MutS to the C-terminus of MutE. Kinetic analysis of this protein, MutES, showed, unexpectedly, that enzyme activity was still co-operatively dependent on protein concentration. The Km for L-glutamate was unchanged from the wild type, whereas Vmax was decreased to approx. one-thirtieth and the Km for coenzyme increased approx. 10-fold. Investigation of the quaternary structure of MutES by equilibrium ultra-centrifugation indicated that the protein existed in equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms. Thus linking MutE and MutS together seems to substantially weaken the contacts that are responsible for the dimerization of MutE. The two domains of the MutES monomer seem unable to communicate, so that active enzyme is formed by the intermolecular association of two MutES subunits in a co-operative manner.	1996 Dec	Holloway D E,Harding S E,Marsh E N	The Biochemical journal. 320 ( Pt 3) 825-30	Glutamate mutase	MELKNKKWTDEEFFKQREEVLKQWPTGKEVDLQEAVDYLKKVPTEKNFADKLVRAKEAGITLAQPRAGVALLDEHINLLRYLQDEGGADLLPSTIDAYTRQNRYEECEIGIKESEKAGRSLLNGFPGVNHGVKGCRKVLESVNLPLQARHGTPDSRLLAEIIHAGGWTSNEGGGISYNIPYAKSVPIDKCLKDWQYCDRLVGFYEEQGVHINREPFGPLTGTLVPPSMSNAVGITEALLAAEQGVKNITVGYGECGNMLQDIAALRCLEEQTNEYLKAYGYNDVFVTTVFHQWMGGFPQDESKAFGVIVTATTIASLAGATKVIVKTPHEAIGIPTKEANASGIKATKMALNMLEGQRMPMSKELETEMAIIKAETKCILDKMFELGKGDLAVGTVKAFETGVMDIPFGPSKYNAGKMMPVRDNLGCVRYLEFGNVPFTEELKNYNRERLAERAKFEGREVSFQMVIDDIFAVGKGRLIGRPEKIVLGVIGSDCHAVGNKILDHSFTNAGFNVVNIGVLSSQEDFINAAIETKADLICVSSLYGQGEIDCKGLREKCDEAGLKGIKLFVGGNIVVGKQNWPDVEQRFKAMGFDRVYPPGTSPETTIADMKEVLGVE	Fusion of E and S subunits.UniProt of S subunit: MAMA_CLOTT	Q05509			7.6	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

10809722	Biochemical characterization of the catalytic domain of human matrix metalloproteinase 19. Evidence for a role as a potent basement membrane degrading enzyme.	We have recently cloned MMP-19, a novel matrix metalloproteinase, which, due to unique structural features, was proposed to represent the first member of a new MMP subfamily (Pendás, A. M., Knäuper, V. , Puente, X. S., Llano, E., Mattei, M. G., Apte, S., Murphy, G., and López-Otin, C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 4281-4286). A recombinant COOH-terminal deletion mutant of MMP-19 (proDelta(260-508)MMP-19), comprising the propeptide and the catalytic domain, was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified. Interestingly, we found that proDelta(260-508)MMP-19 has the tendency to autoactivate, whereby the Lys(97)-Tyr(98) peptide bond is hydrolyzed, resulting in free catalytic domain. Mutation of two residues (Glu(88) --&gt; Pro and Pro(90) --&gt; Val) within the propeptide latency motif did not prevent autoactivation but the autolysis rate was somewhat reduced. Analysis of the substrate specificity revealed that the catalytic domain of MMP-19 was able to hydrolyze the general MMP substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH(2) and, with higher efficiency, the stromelysin substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH(2). Kinetic analysis of the interactions of the catalytic domain of MMP-19 with the natural MMP inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), showed strong inhibition using TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4, while TIMP-1 was less efficient. We also demonstrated that synthetic hydroxamic acid-based compounds efficiently inhibited the enzyme. The catalytic domain of MMP-19 was able to hydrolyze the basement membrane components type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen, as well as the large tenascin-C isoform, fibronectin, and type I gelatin in vitro, suggesting that MMP-19 is a potent proteinase capable of hydrolyzing a broad range of extracellular matrix components.

10809722	Biochemical characterization of the catalytic domain of human matrix metalloproteinase 19. Evidence for a role as a potent basement membrane degrading enzyme.	We have recently cloned MMP-19, a novel matrix metalloproteinase, which, due to unique structural features, was proposed to represent the first member of a new MMP subfamily (Pendás, A. M., Knäuper, V. , Puente, X. S., Llano, E., Mattei, M. G., Apte, S., Murphy, G., and López-Otin, C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 4281-4286). A recombinant COOH-terminal deletion mutant of MMP-19 (proDelta(260-508)MMP-19), comprising the propeptide and the catalytic domain, was expressed in Escherichia coli, refolded, and purified. Interestingly, we found that proDelta(260-508)MMP-19 has the tendency to autoactivate, whereby the Lys(97)-Tyr(98) peptide bond is hydrolyzed, resulting in free catalytic domain. Mutation of two residues (Glu(88) --&gt; Pro and Pro(90) --&gt; Val) within the propeptide latency motif did not prevent autoactivation but the autolysis rate was somewhat reduced. Analysis of the substrate specificity revealed that the catalytic domain of MMP-19 was able to hydrolyze the general MMP substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH(2) and, with higher efficiency, the stromelysin substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Ala-Nva-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH(2). Kinetic analysis of the interactions of the catalytic domain of MMP-19 with the natural MMP inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), showed strong inhibition using TIMP-2, TIMP-3, and TIMP-4, while TIMP-1 was less efficient. We also demonstrated that synthetic hydroxamic acid-based compounds efficiently inhibited the enzyme. The catalytic domain of MMP-19 was able to hydrolyze the basement membrane components type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen, as well as the large tenascin-C isoform, fibronectin, and type I gelatin in vitro, suggesting that MMP-19 is a potent proteinase capable of hydrolyzing a broad range of extracellular matrix components. Neither the catalytic domain nor the full-length MMP-19 was able to degrade triple-helical collagen.

11342552	Interaction of human pancreatic ribonuclease with human ribonuclease inhibitor. Generation of inhibitor-resistant cytotoxic variants.	Mammalian ribonucleases interact very strongly with the intracellular ribonuclease inhibitor (RI). Eukaryotic cells exposed to mammalian ribonucleases are protected from their cytotoxic action by the intracellular inhibition of ribonucleases by RI. Human pancreatic ribonuclease (HPR) is structurally and functionally very similar to bovine RNase A and interacts with human RI with a high affinity. In the current study, we have investigated the involvement of Lys-7, Gln-11, Asn-71, Asn-88, Gly-89, Ser-90, and Glu-111 in HPR in its interaction with human ribonuclease inhibitor. These contact residues were mutated either individually or in combination to generate mutants K7A, Q11A, N71A, E111A, N88R, G89R, S90R, K7A/E111A, Q11A/E111A, N71A/E111A, K7A/N71A/E111A, Q11A/N71A/E111A, and K7A/Q11A/N71A/E111A. Out of these, eight mutants, K7A, Q11A, N71A, S90R, E111A, Q11A/E111A, N71A/E111A, and K7A/N71A/E111A, showed an ability to evade RI more than the wild type HPR, with the triple mutant K7A/N71A/E111A having the maximum RI resistance. As a result, these variants exhibited higher cytotoxic activity than wild type HPR. The mutation of Gly-89 in HPR produced no change in the sensitivity of HPR for RI, whereas it has been reported that mutating the equivalent residue Gly-88 in RNase A yielded a variant with increased RI resistance and cytotoxicity. Hence, despite its considerable homology with RNase A, HPR shows differences in its interaction with RI. We demonstrate that interaction between human pancreatic ribonuclease and RI can be disrupted by mutating residues that are involved in HPR-RI binding. The inhibitor-resistant cytotoxic HPR mutants should be useful in developing therapeutic molecules.	2001 Jul	Gaur D,Swaminathan S,Batra J K	The Journal of biological chemistry. 276(27) 24978-84	Ribonuclease A	KESRAKKFQRQHMDSDSSPSSSSTYCNQMMRRRNMTQGRCKPVNTFVHEPLVDVQNVCFQEKVTCKNGQGNCYKSNSSMHITDCRLTNGSRYPNCAYRTSPKERHIIVACEGSPYVPVHFDASVEDST	A variety of mutants also constructed	P07998			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
9430670	Independent folding and ligand specificity of the C2 calcium-dependent lipid binding domain of cytosolic phospholipase A2.	The Ca(2+)-dependent lipid binding domain of the 85-kDa cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) is a homolog of C2 domains present in protein kinase C, synaptotagmin, and numerous other proteins involved in signal transduction. NH2-terminal fragments of cPLA2 spanning the C2 domain were expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, extracted with solvent to remove phospholipids, and refolded to yield a domain capable of binding phospholipid vesicles in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Unlike other C2 domains characterized to date, the cPLA2 C2 domain bound preferentially to vesicles comprised of phosphatidylcholine in response to physiological concentrations of Ca2+. Binding of the cPLA2 C2 domain to vesicles in the presence of excess Ca2+ chelator was induced by high concentrations of salts that promote hydrophobic interactions. Despite the selective hydrolysis of arachidonyl-containing phospholipid vesicles by cPLA2, the cPLA2 C2 domain did not discriminate among phospholipid vesicles containing saturated or unsaturated sn-2 fatty acyl chains. Moreover, the cPLA2 C2 domain bound to phospholipid vesicles containing sn-1 and -2 ether linkages and sphingomyelin at Ca2+ concentrations that caused binding to vesicles containing ester linkages, demonstrating that the carbonyl oxygens of the sn-1 and -2 ester linkage are not critical for binding. These results suggest that the cPLA2 C2 domain interacts primarily with the headgroup of the phospholipid. The cPLA2 C2 domain displayed selectivity among group IIA cations, preferring Ca2+ approximately 50-fold over Sr2+ and nearly 10,000-fold over Ba2+ for vesicle binding. No binding to vesicles was observed in the presence of greater than 10 mM Mg2+. Such strong selectivity for Ca2+ over Mg2+ reinforces the view that C2 domains link second messenger Ca2+ to signal transduction events at the membrane.	1998 Jan	Nalefski E A,McDonagh T,Somers W,Seehra J,Falke J J,Clark J D	The Journal of biological chemistry. 273(3) 1365-72	Cytosolic phospholipase A2	MSFIDPYQHIIVEHQYSHKFTVVVLRATKVTKGAFGDMLDTPDPYVELFISTTPDSRKRTRHFNNDINPVWNETFEFILDPNQENVLEITLMDANYVMDETLGTATFTVSSMKVGEKKEVPFIFNQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P47712		Truncated C2 domain aa.1-126	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

11035957	Development of a recombinant bacterial expression system for the active form of a human transforming growth factor beta type II receptor ligand binding domain.	Expression systems have been designed to test the suitability of expressing the high cysteine containing extracellular domain (residues 1-136) of human transforming growth factor beta type II receptor (TbetaRII). Receptor expressed using a baculovirus system was functional following both enzymatic deglycosylation and elimination of the N-terminal 22 amino acids by protease degradation. Bacterial expression of a TbetaRII lacking the 26 N-terminal amino acids retained the ability to bind its ligand, TGF-beta1. Receptor expressed in bacteria was sensitive to proteolytic degradation at residue Lys98 but a K98T mutation eliminated degradation and did not disrupt binding. Although several different forms of TbetaRII were expressed, only a fusion with glutathione S-transferase gave soluble TbetaRII, which was purified at a yield of 0.1 mg/10 L of bacterial growth. N-Terminal truncations of TbetaRII (residues 22-136 or 27-136) could be refolded from inclusion bodies and purified to an active form with an efficiency of 10%.	2000 Oct	Boesen C C,Motyka S A,Patamawenu A,Sun P D	Protein expression and purification. 20(1) 98-104	TGF-beta receptor type II	AKFPQLCKFCDVRFSTCDNQKSCMSNCSITSICEKPQEVCVAVWRKNDENITLETVCHDPKLPYHDFILEDAASPKCIMKEKKKPGETFFMCSCSSDECNDNIIFSEEYNTSNP		P37173		aa.22-136	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

12491527	Bioimmobilization of keratinase using Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli systems.	Immobilized keratinase can improve stability while retaining its proteolytic and keratinolytic properties. Conventional purification followed by chemical immobilization is a laborious and costly process. A new genetic construct was developed to produce the keratinase-streptavidin fusion protein. Consequently, the purification and immobilization of the fusion protein onto a biotinylated matrix can be accomplished in a single step. The method was tested in both the Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli systems. In B. subtilis, the fusion protein was produced extracellularly and readily immobilized from the medium. In E. coli, the fusion protein was produced intracellularly in inclusion bodies; additional separation and renaturation processes were required prior to immobilization from the cell extract. The overall efficiencies were approximately the same, 24-28%, using both systems.	2003 Feb	Wang Jeng-Jie,Swaisgood Harold E,Shih Jason C H	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 81(4) 421-9	Keratinase	QPAKNVEKDYIVGFKSGVKTASVKKDIIKESGGKVDKQFRIINAAKAKLDKEALKEVKNDPDVAYVEEDHVAHALAQTVPYGIPLIKADKVQAQGFKGANVKVAVLDTGIQASHPDLNVVGGASFVAGEAYNTDGNGHGTHVAGTVAALDNTTGVLGVAPSVSLYAVKVLNSSGSGSYSGIVSGIEWATTNGMDVINMSLGGASGSTAMKQAVDNAYARGVVVVAAAGNSGSSGNTNTIGYPAKYDSVIAVGAVDSNSNRASFSSVGAELEVMAPGAGVYSTYPTNTYATLNGTSMVSPHVAGAAALILSKHPNLSASQVRNRLSSTATYLGSSFYYGKGLINVEAAAQ	approximated sequence only.A range of other constructs with or without the Pre and Pro regions of keratinase also produced	Q53521			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
8745410	Reconstitution of active octameric mitochondrial creatine kinase from two genetically engineered fragments.	Creatine kinase (CK) has been postulated to consist of two flexibly hinged domains. A previously demonstrated protease-sensitive site in M-CK (Morris &amp; Jackson, 1991) has directed our attempts to dissect mitochondrial CK (Mi-CK) into two protein fragments encompassing amino acids [1-167] and [168-380]. When expressed separately in Escherichia coli, the two fragments yielded large amounts of insoluble inclusion bodies, from which the respective polypeptides could be purified by a simple two-step procedure. In contrast, co-expression of the two fragments yielded a soluble, active, and correctly oligomerizing enzyme. This discontinuous CK showed nearly full specific activity and was virtually indistinguishable from native Mi-CK by far- and near-UV CD. However, the positive cooperativity of substrate binding was abolished, suggesting a role of the covalent domain linkage in the crosstalk between the substrate binding sites for ATP and creatine. The isolated C-terminal fragment refolded into a native-like conformation in vitro, whereas the N-terminal fragment was largely unfolded. Prefolded [168-380] interacted in vitro with [1-167] to form an active enzyme. Kinetic analysis indicated that the fragments associate rapidly and with high affinity (1/K1 = 17 microM) and then isomerize slowly to an active enzyme (k2 = 0.12 min-1; k-2 = 0.03 min-1). Our data suggest that the C-terminal fragment of Mi-CK represents an autonomous folding unit, and that the folding of the C-terminal part might precede the conformational stabilization of the N-terminal moiety in vivo.	1996 Feb	Gross M,Wyss M,Furter-Graves E M,Wallimann T,Furter R	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 5(2) 320-30	Creatine kinase	EFKGRYYPLKAMTEQEQQQLIDDHFLFDKPVSPLLLASGMARDWPDARGIWHNDNKTFLVWVNEEDHLRVISMEKGGNMKEVFRRFCVGLKKIEEIFKKAGHPFMWTEHLGYILTCPSNLGTGLRGGVHVKLPKLSQHPKFEEILHRLRLQKRGTGGVDTAAVGAVFDISNADRLGFSEVEQVQMVVDGVKLMVEMEKKLEQNQPIDDMIPAQK	Mitochondrial creatine kinase	P00565		Fragment aa.168-380	7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

16083870	Production of biologically active recombinant human soluble CD23 and its effect on PBMCs isolated from hyper-IgE blood.	A recombinant form of human soluble CD23 (sCD23), the low affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRII), was produced by PCR cloning the lectin-binding domain sequence into a bacterial expression vector. After renaturation and purification, the sCD23 bound IgE and divalent metal ions, indicating its activity. The recombinant human sCD23 exhibited similar proinflammatory properties as the native protein. Although interleukin-1beta, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappaB appeared not to be enhanced significantly in unstimulated RPMI 8866 B-lymphoblastoid and U937 promonocytic cell lines with 24 h incubation of recombinant sCD23, they were produced in both healthy and hyper-IgE-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells, especially tumour necrosis factor-alpha. This study concludes that while recombinant and chimeric sCD23 may be useful in blocking IgE binding to immune cells and decreasing IgE synthesis by B-lymphocytes, the production of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly tumour necrosis factor-alpha will enhance immune responses in cases of asthma, allergy, and hyper-IgE syndrome.	2005 Apr	Daniels Brodie B,Askew Sandra L,van de Venter Maryna,Oosthuizen Vaughan	Cellular immunology. 234(2) 146-53	Low affinity IgE Fc Receptor	MEEGQYSEIEELPRRRCCRRGTQIVLLGLVTAALWAGLLTLLLLWHWDTTQSLKQLEERAARNVSQVSKNLESHHGDQMAQKSQSTQISQELEELRAEQQRLKSQDLELSWNLNGLQADLSSFKSQELNERNEASDLLERLREEVTKLRMELQVSSGFVCNTCPEKWINFQRKCYYFGKGTKQWVHARYACDDMEGQLVSIHSPEEQDFLTKHASHTGSWIGLRNLDLKGEFIWVDGSHVDYSNWAPGEPTSRSQGEDCVMMRGSGRWNDAFCDRKLGAWVCDRLATCTPPASEGSAESMGPDSRPDPDGRLPTPSAPLHS	NMR solution of 16 kDa fragment of lectin homology domain.

Aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase( 2&#39;&#39;)-Ia (ANT( 2&#39;&#39;) confers resistance to pathogenic bacteria against several aminoglycoside antibiotics including gentamicin, kanamycin, and tobramycin. The gene for this aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme has been cloned from a clinical isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This gene was inserted into an overexpression vector, the vector was then transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and the protein has been isolated in the form of inclusion bodies. Optimal refolding conditions have been determined to be direct dilution of solubilized inclusion bodies into 0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.2M KCl, 0.4M l-arginine, and 5mM reduced glutathione at 4 degrees C. The refolded enzyme is monomeric in solution and has similar kinetic properties and substrate selectivity to the enzyme isolated in soluble form.	2004 Jun	Wright Edward,Serpersu Engin H	Protein expression and purification. 35(2) 373-80	Aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase(2&quot;)-Ia	MPRASKQQARYAVGRCLMLWSSNDVTQQGSRPKTKLGRMDTTQVTLIHKILAAADERNLPLWIGGGWAIDARLGRVTRKHDDIDLTFPGERRGELEAIVEMLGGRVMEELDYGFLAEIGDELLDCEPAWWADEAYEIAEAPQGSCPEAAEGVIAGRPVRCNSWEAIIWDYFYYADEVPPVDWPTKHIESYRLACTSLGAEKVEVLRAAFRSRYAA		Q6X3H6			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
16275767	Circadian rhythm of a TCA cycle enzyme is apparently regulated at the translational level in the dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum.	Previously, the authors have reported that intracellular amounts of several metabolic-related enzymes from the photosynthetic dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum(formerly Gonyaulax polyedra) showed a daily rhythm under a 12:12 h LD cycle. This led the authors to hypothesize that a circadian clock controls metabolism, including the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In this study, the authors investigated daily changes in the levels of mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity of several metabolic enzymes during 12:12 h LD, 8:16 h LD, and constant light conditions. The NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADPICDH) in the TCA cycle exhibited circadian changes of protein abundance and enzyme activity under all conditions, whereas its mRNA level remained constant throughout the cycle. These results indicate that the rhythm of NADPICDH is regulated by a circadian control of protein synthesis or modification rather than by message levels and suggest that the TCA cycle may be controlled by the circadian clock system.	2005 Dec	Akimoto Hidetoshi,Kinumi Tomoya,Ohmiya Yoshihiro	Journal of biological rhythms. 20(6) 479-89	Succinate dehydrogenase	mwrcvsrgfrapasktsslfdgvsgsrfsrffstgstdtrssytivdhtydavvvgaggaglraaiglsehgfntacitklfptrshtvaaqgginaalgnmseddwrwhmydtvkgsdwlgdqdaiqymcreapkavielenyglpfsrteegkiyqrafggqsldfgkggqayrcacaadrtghallhtlygqamkhntqffveyfaldllmasdgscqgvialnmedgtlhrfrssqtilatggygrayfsatsahtctgdgnamvaraglplqdlefvqfhptgiygagclitegsrgeggilrnsegerfmeryaptakdlasrdvvsrsmtmeiregrgvgphkylhlnhlppevlkerlpgisetaaifagvdvtkepipvlptvhynmggiptnyhgevvtikgddpdavipglmaageaacasvhganrlganslldivvfgracanrvaeiskpgekqkplekdagektiawldrlrnsngslptstirlnmqrimqnnaavfrtqetleegcqlidkawesfgdvqvkdrsmiwnsdlietlelenllinasitmhsaearkesrgaharedftkredgewmkhtlgywedekvrldyrpvhmdtlddeidtfppkarvy	N-terminal hexahistidine tag				8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

Previously, the authors have reported that intracellular amounts of several metabolic-related enzymes from the photosynthetic dinoflagellate Lingulodinium polyedrum(formerly Gonyaulax polyedra) showed a daily rhythm under a 12:12 h LD cycle.

17459723	Over-expression and refolding of MAP kinase phosphatase 3.	MAP kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3, also known as DUSP6 and PYST1) is involved in extracellular signal receptor kinase (ERK) regulation and functions as a specific phosphatase to the activated (phosphorylated) forms of ERK1 and ERK2. MKP3 displays allosteric activation, which aids in tightly regulating its function to ERK substrates, but not other related MAPKs. Due to MKP3&#39;s specificity for the ERK signaling pathway, the development of specific activators or inhibitors to the enzyme have been suggested in order to expressly influence the ERK1 and ERK2 pathways. To produce the high yields of MKP3 protein necessary for physico-chemical characterization of MKP3 and for high throughput screening of its small-molecule activators and inhibitors, we have cloned, purified and, and identified refolding conditions suitable for producing full-length, human MKP3 from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of a 96-well plate format refolding assay in which the ERK-induced activity of MKP3 is simulated by 33 0MSO. The assay allowed for rapid detection of MKP3&#39;s function following a refolding screen in the absence of ERK and thus provides quick and inexpensive testing of MKP3 activity. Following screening, the refolded product was confirmed to be correctly folded by steady-state kinetic analysis and by the CD spectroscopy-determined secondary structure content. CD data were consistent with 36% helix and 14heet, which compared to an expected 32.9% helix and 12.4heet. These data indicated that MKP3 was properly folded, making it a suitable protein for use in functional studies.	2007 Aug	Mark John K,Smith Sophie,Hefford Mary Alice	Protein expression and purification. 54(2) 253-60	MAP kinase phosphatase 3	MIDTLRPVPFASEMAISKTVAWLNEQLELGNERLLLMDCRPQELYESSHIESAINVAIPGIMLRRLQKGNLPVRALFTRGEDRDRFTRRCGTDTVVLYDESSSDWNENTGGESVLGLLLKKLKDEGCRAFYLEGGFSKFQAEFSLHCETNLDGSCSSSSPPLPVLGLGGLRISSDSSSDIESDLDRDPNSATDSDGSPLSNSQPSFPVEILPFLYLGCAKDSTNLDVLEEFGIKYILNVTPNLPNLFENAGEFKYKQIPISDHWSQNLSQFFPEAISFIDEARGKNCGVLVHCLAGISRSVTVTVAYLMQKLNLSMNDAYDIVKMKKSNISPNFNFMGQLLDFERTLGLSSPCDNRVPAQQLYFTTPSNQNVYQVDSLQST	N-terminal hexahistidine tag + thrombin cleavage site	Q16828			7.6	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
17169572	Production of recombinant human alpha1-microglobulin and mutant forms involved in chromophore formation.	Alpha(1)-Microglobulin, a 26 kDa lipocalin present in plasma and tissues, carries a set of unknown chromophores, bound to C34, K92, K118 and K130, which cause its charge and size heterogeneity. In man, the protein is found in two forms, full length and lacking the C-terminal tetrapeptide LIPR (t-alpha(1)-microglobulin), both which are heme-binding and the latter with heme-degrading properties. We report cloning and overexpression of full length alpha(1)-microglobulin (wt protein), t-alpha(1)-microglobulin (wtdeltaLIPR) and the mutants C34S, K(92,118,130)T and C34S/K(92,118,130)T, the latter subsequently abbreviated as K(3)T and C34S/K(3)T, in Escherichia coli. After purification and refolding from inclusion bodies, all proteins were correctly folded as determined by far-UV circular dichroism and radioimmunoassay. As revealed by gel filtration, recombinant alpha(1)-microglobulins had lower tendencies to form dimers than human plasma or urine analogues. All alpha(1)-microglobulin forms displayed higher amounts of the chromophore than bovine serum albumin but significantly lower than the human urine or plasma counterparts. Differences in the absorbance and fluorescence profiles are consistent with a model where the chromophore is formed by a series of reactions with heme or other chromophore precursors and where C34 is essential for binding of the ligand, K92, K118 and K130 are involved in transformation into the chromophore and LIPR inhibits the latter reaction.	2007 May	Kwasek Anna,Osmark Peter,Allhorn Maria,Lindqvist Annika,Akerström Bo,Wasylewski Zygmunt	Protein expression and purification. 53(1) 145-52	Alpha-1-microglobulin	GPVPTPPDNIQVQENFNISRIYGKWYNLAIGSTCPWLKKIMDRMTVSTLVLGEGATEAEISMTSTRWRKGVCEETSGAYEKTDTDGKFLYHKSKWNITMESYVVHTNYDEYAIFLTKKFSRHHGPTITAKLYGRAPQLRETLLQDFRVVAQGVGIPEDSIFTMADRGECVPGEQEPEPILIPRV	alpha-1-Microglobulin (a1m), also called protein HC (heterogeneous in charge), is a 26 kDa plasma and tissue protein belonging to the superfamily of lipocalins [1], a group of proteins sharing a characteristic eight-stranded beta-barrel fold with a hydrophobic pocket acting as a ligand-binding site.

16740384	Folding aggregated proteins into functionally active forms.	The successful expression and purification of proteins in an active form is essential for structural and biochemical studies. With rapid advances in genome sequencing and high-throughput structural biology, an increasing number of proteins are being identified as potential drug targets but are difficult to obtain in a form suitable for structural or biochemical studies. Although prokaryotic recombinant expression systems are often used, proteins obtained in this way are typically found to be insoluble. Several experimental approaches have therefore been developed to refold these aggregated proteins into a biologically active form, often suitable for structural studies. The major refolding strategies adopt one of two approaches - chromatographic methods or refolding in free solution - and both routes have been successfully used to refold a range of proteins. Future advances are likely to involve the development of automated approaches for protein refolding and purification.	2006 Aug	Swietnicki Wieslaw	Current opinion in biotechnology. 17(4) 367-72	C-phycoerythrin class I alpha chain	MKSVVTTVVTAADAAGRFPSQNDLEAVQGNIQRAAARLEAAEKLAAGLDNVTREAGDACFNKYAYLKQPGEAGDSQVKIDKCYRDLGHYLRLINYCLIVGGTGPLDEWGIAGAREVYRTLGLPTNAYIEALTYTRDRACAPRDMSAQALNEFKSYLDYAINALS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag + thrombin cleavage site	Q7U4Q1			7.2	23	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
17703946	Purification and refolding optimization of recombinant bovine enterokinase light chain overexpressed in Escherichia coli.	The nucleotide sequence encoding bovine enterokinase light chain (EK) from Chinese northern yellow bovine was isolated. Two single-nucleotide mutations, namely, C245G and A528T were identified. The gene encoding the Pro82Arg/Glu176Asp variant of known bovine EK was fused with glutathione S-transferase and overexpressed mainly as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), upon induction with IPTG and glucose. Effective fusion protein purification, refolding, auto-catalytic cleavage and mature EK recovery were described. The specific activity of the purified EK was determined as 110+/- 10 U/mg, which was comparable to a specific activity of &gt; or =20 U/mg of the E. coli expressed EK sample provided by Sigma (Cat. No. E4906). This procedure produced approximately 53 mg of EK per 500 mL of cell culture, which was much higher than previous reports, thus providing a basis for large-scale production of EK and for further applications in biotechnology.	2007 Nov	Tan Haidong,Wang Jinxia,Zhao Zongbao Kent	Protein expression and purification. 56(1) 40-7	Enterokinase light chain	IVGGSDSREGAWPWVVALYFDDQQVCGASLVSRDWLVSAAHCVYGRNMEPSKWKAVLGLHMASNLTSPQIETRLIDQIVINRHYNKRRKNNDIAMMHLEMKVNYTDYIQPICLPEENQVFPPGRICSIAGWGALIYQGSTADVLQEADVPLLSNEKCQQQMPEYNITENMVCAGYDAGGVDSCQGDSGGPLMCQENNRWLLAGVTSFGYQCALPNRPGVYARVPRFTEWIQSFLH	N-terminal GST	Q6B4R4			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16081647	Characterization and enzymatic degradation of Sup35NM, a yeast prion-like protein.	Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are believed to be caused by an unconventional infectious agent, the prion protein. The pathogenic and infectious form of prion protein, PrPSc, is able to aggregate and form amyloid fibrils, very stable and resistant to most disinfecting processes and common proteases. Under specific conditions, PrPSc in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) brain tissue was found degradable by a bacterial keratinase and some other proteases. Since this disease-causing prion is infectious and dangerous to work with, a model or surrogate protein that is safe is needed for the in vitro degradation study. Here a nonpathogenic yeast prion-like protein, Sup35NM, cloned and overexpressed in E. coli, was purified and characterized for this purpose. Aggregation and deaggregation of Sup35NM were examined by electron microscopy, gel electrophoresis, Congo red binding, fluorescence, and Western blotting. The degradation of Sup35NM aggregates by keratinase and proteinase K under various conditions was studied and compared. These results will be of value in understanding the mechanism and optimization of the degradation process.	2005 Sep	Chen Ching-Ying,Rojanatavorn Kawan,Clark A Clay,Shih Jason C H	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 14(9) 2228-35	prion-like yeast protein	unknown					8		f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

16305800	Crystal structure of human BACE2 in complex with a hydroxyethylamine transition-state inhibitor.	BACE2 is a membrane-bound aspartic protease of the A1 family with a high level of sequence homology to BACE1. While BACE1 is involved in the generation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer&#39;s disease by cleaving Abeta-peptides from the amyloid precursor protein, the physiological function of BACE2 is not well understood. BACE2 appears to be associated with the early onset of dementia in patients with Down&#39;s syndrome, and it has been shown to be highly expressed in breast cancers. Further, it may participate in the function of normal and abnormal processes of human muscle biology. Similar to other aspartic proteases, BACE2 is expressed as an inactive zymogen requiring the cleavage of its pro-sequence during the maturation process. We have produced mature BACE2 by expression of pro-BACE2 in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, followed by refolding and autocatalytic activation at pH 3.4. Using a C and N-terminally truncated BACE2 variant, we were able to crystallize and determine the crystal structure of mature BACE2 in complex with a hydroxyethylamine transition-state mimetic inhibitor at 3.1 angstroms resolution. The structure of BACE2 follows the general fold of A1 aspartic proteases. However, similar to BACE1, its C-terminal domain is significantly larger than that of the other family members. Furthermore, the structure of BACE2 reveals differences in the S3, S2, S1&#39; and S2&#39; active site substrate pockets as compared to BACE1, and allows, therefore, for a deeper understanding of the structural features that may facilitate the design of selective BACE1 or BACE2 inhibitors.	2006 Jan	Ostermann Nils,Eder Jörg,Eidhoff Ulf,Zink Florence,Hassiepen Ulrich,Worpenberg Susanne,Maibaum Jürgen,Simic Oliver,Hommel Ulrich,Gerhartz Bernd	Journal of molecular biology. 355(2) 249-61	Beta amyloid cleaving enzyme 2	MGALARALLLPLLAQWLLRAAPELAPAPFTLPLRVAAATNRVVAPTPGPGTPAERHADGLALALEPALASPAGAANFLAMVDNLQGDSGRGYYLEMLIGTPPQKLQILVDTGSSNFAVAGTPHSYIDTYFDTERSSTYRSKGFDVTVKYTQGSWTGFVGEDLVTIPKGFNTSFLVNIATIFESENFFLPGIKWNGILGLAYATLAKPSSSLETFFDSLVTQANIPNVFSMQMCGAGLPVAGSGTNGGSLVLGGIEPSLYKGDIWYTPIKEEWYYQIEILKLEIGGQSLNLDCREYNADKAIVDSGTTLLRLPQKVFDAVVEAVARASLIPEFSDGFWTGSQLACWTNSETPWSYFPKISIYLRDENSSRSFRITILPQLYIQPMMGAGLNYECYRFGISPSTNALVIGATVMEGFYVIFDRAQKRVGFAASPCAEIAGAAVSEISGPFSTEDVASNCVPAQSLSEPILWIVSYALMSVCGAILLVLIVLLLLPFRCQRRPRDPEVVNDESSLVRHRWK	Like all A1 aspartic proteases, BACE2 is synthesized as a zymogen. The precursor forms are catalytically inactive towards their natural substrates, due to their N-terminal pro-sequence folding across the active site. Activation of aspartic proteases requires the removal of the pro-sequence either in an autocatalytic manner or by the assistance of an activation protease. The activation pathway is characterized by structural changes in a stepwise fashion and has been mapped, in part, by determining the crystal structures of various activation intermediates. Further to the function of regulating the activity of a protease, pro-sequences are known to impact on protease folding, particularly by lowering the free energy of the transition state. The important role of the pro-sequence for folding of aspartic proteases is reflected by the fact that recombinant expression of renin and cathepsin D in mammalian cells decreases significantly in the absence of their pro-sequences. Moreover, all members of this protein family require their pro-sequence for proper folding, with the exception of BACE1, which, although less efficient, does fold in the absence of its pro-sequence.,N-terminal T7 tag	Q9Y5Z0			10.4	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

15236960	Studies of the RNA degradosome-organizing domain of the Escherichia coli ribonuclease RNase E.	The hydrolytic endoribonuclease RNase E, which is widely distributed in bacteria and plants, plays key roles in mRNA degradation and RNA processing in Escherichia coli. The enzymatic activity of RNase E is contained within the conserved amino-terminal half of the 118 kDa protein, and the carboxy-terminal half organizes the RNA degradosome, a multi-enzyme complex that degrades mRNA co-operatively and processes ribosomal and other RNA. The study described herein demonstrates that the carboxy-terminal domain of RNase E has little structure under native conditions and is unlikely to be extensively folded within the degradosome. However, three isolated segments of 10-40 residues, and a larger fourth segment of 80 residues, are predicted to be regions of increased structural propensity. The larger of these segments appears to be a protein-RNA interaction site while the other segments possibly correspond to sites of self-recognition and interaction with the other degradosome proteins. The carboxy-terminal domain of RNase E may thus act as a flexible tether of the degradosome components. The implications of these and other observations for the organization of the RNA degradosome are discussed.	2004 Jul	Callaghan Anastasia J,Aurikko Jukka P,Ilag Leopold L,Günter Grossmann J,Chandran Vidya,Kühnel Karin,Poljak Leonora,Carpousis Agamennon J,Robinson Carol V,Symmons Martyn F,Luisi Ben F	Journal of molecular biology. 340(5) 965-79	RNase E C-terminal Domain	LSYMLPKLHEEAMALPSEEEFAERKRPEQPALATFAMPDVPPAPTPAEPAAPVVAPAPKAAPATPAAPAQPGLLSRFFGALKALFSGGEETKPTEQPAPKAEAKPERQQDRRKPRQNNRRDRNERRDTRSERTEGSDNREENRRNRRQAQQQTAETRESRQQAEVTEKARTADEQQAPRRERSRRRNDDKRQAQQEAKALNVEEQSVQETEQEERVRPVQPRRKQRQLNQKVRYEQSVAEEAVVAPVVEETVAAEPIVQEAPAPRTELVKVPLPVVAQTAPEQQEENNADNRDNGGMPRRSRRSPRHLRVSGQRRRRYRDERYPTQSPMPLTVACASPELASGKVWIRYPIVRPQDVQVEEQREQEEVHVQPMVTEVPVAAAIEPVVSAPVVEEVAGVVEAPVQVAEPQPEVVETTHPEVIAAAVTEQPQVITESDVAVAQEVAEQAEPVVEPQEETADIEEVVETAEVVVAEPEVVAQPAAPVVAEVAAEVETVAAVEPEVTVEHNHATAPMTRAPAPEYVPEAPRHSDWQRPTFAFEGKGAAGGHTATHHASAAPARPQPVE	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P21513		C-terminal Domain	7.7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
12007799	NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase from the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii: cloning, sequence determination and overexpression in Escherichia coli.	A gene encoding NADP-dependent Ds-threo-isocitrate dehydrogenase was isolated from Haloferax volcanii genomic DNA by using a combination of polymerase chain reaction and screening of a lambda EMBL3 library. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1260 bp encoding a protein of 419 amino acids with 45837 Da molecular mass. This sequence is highly similar to previously sequenced isocitrate dehydrogenases. In the alignment of the amino acid sequences with those from several archaeal and mesophilic NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, the residues involved in dinucleotide binding and isocitrate binding are well conserved. We have developed methods for the expression in Escherichia coli and purification of the enzyme from H. volcanii. This expression was carried out in E. coli as inclusion bodies using the cytoplasmic expression vector pET3a. The enzyme was refolded by solubilisation in 8 M urea followed by dilution into a buffer containing EDTA, MgCl(2) and 3 M NaCl.

Protein HC was first overexpressed as a C-LytA/HC fusion protein containing the C-terminal moiety of the pneumococcal lytic amidase (LytA). Recombinant C-LytA/HC was found to be an insoluble aggregate that was solubilized with 6 M guanidinium chloride and renatured by the addition of thiol reagents in the presence of L-arginine. Recombinant protein HC (rHC) was released from C-LytA/HC by trypsin digestion and purified by size-exclusion chromatography. rHC protein possesses an N-terminal amino-acid sequence identical to that of human protein HC, and a slightly lower molecular mass as determined by SDS-PAGE. Both C-LytA/HC and rHC reacted with polyclonal antibodies raised against native protein HC. A photodiode array detection system on-line with a HPLC system has allowed the identification of a chromophore associated to rHC protein displaying significant absorption in the visible region of the spectrum in resemblance to that found in the natural form of human protein HC.	1995 May	Calero M,Méndez E,García E	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1249(1) 91-9	Human Complex-forming glycoprotein HC	GPVPTPPDNIQVQENFNISRIYGKWYNLAIGSTCPWLKKIMDRMTVSTLVLGEGATEAEISMTSTRWRKGVCEETSGAYEKTDTDGKFLYHKSKWNITMESYVVHTNYDEYAIFLTKKFSRHHGPTITAKLYGRAPQLRETLLQDFRVVAQGVGIPEDSIFTMADRGECVPGEQEPEPILIPRV	C-LytA	P02760			8	10	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16316618	A novel protein refolding method using a zeolite.	We have succeeded in developing a simple and effective protein refolding method using the inorganic catalyst, beta-zeolite. The method involves the adsorption of proteins solubilized with 6M guanidine hydrochloride from inclusion body (IB) preparations onto the zeolite. The denaturant is then removed, and the proteins in the IBs are released from the zeolite with polyoxyethylene detergent and salt. All of the IBs tested (11 different species) were successfully refolded under these conditions. The refolded proteins are biochemically active, and NMR analysis of one of the proteins (replication protein A 8) supports the conclusion that correct refolding does occur. Based on these results, we discuss the refolding mechanism.	2006 Jan	Chiku Hiroyuki,Kawai Akiko,Ishibashi Toyotaka,Takehara Masahide,Yanai Takuro,Mizukami Fujio,Sakaguchi Kengo	Analytical biochemistry. 348(2) 307-14	Replication Protein A 70	MVGQLSEGAIAAIMQKGDTNIKPILQVINIRPITTGNSPPRYRLLMSDGLNTLSSFMLATQLNPLVEEEQLSSNCVCQIHRFIVNTLKDGRRVVILMELEVLKSAEAVGVKIGNPVPYNEGLGQPQVAPPAPAASPAASSRPQPQNGSSGMGSTVSKAYGASKTFGKAAGPSLSHTSGGTQSKVVPIASLTPYQSKWTICARVTNKSQIRTWSNSRGEGKLFSLELVDESGEIRATAFNEQVDKFFPLIEVNKVYYFSKGTLKIANKQFTAVKNDYEMTFNNETSVMPCEDDHHLPTVQFDFTGIDDLENKSKDSLVDIIGICKSYEDATKITVRSNNREVAKRNIYLMDTSGKVVTATLWGEDADKFDGSRQPVLAIKGARVSDFGGRSLSVLSSSTIIANPDIPEAYKLRGWFDAEGQALDGVSISDLKSGGVGGSNTNWKTLYEVKSENLGQGDKPDYFSSVATVVYLRKENCMYQACPTQDCNKKVIDQQNGLYRCEKCDTEFPNFKYRMILSVNIADFQENQWVTCFQESAEAILGQNAAYLGELKDKNEQAFEEVFQNANFRSFIFRVRVKVETYNDESRIKATVMDVKPVDYREYGRRLVMSIRRSALM		P27694			7.5	4	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12890551	Recombinant goldfish growth hormones (gfGH-I and -II) expressed in Escherichia coli have similar biological activities.	Complementary DNA regions coding for two different mature goldfish growth hormones (gfGH-I and gfGH-II) with four and five cysteine residues were cloned into the bacterial expression vector, pRSETA. The recombinant gfGH-I (five cysteines) and -II (four cysteines) were produced in Escherichia coli as the fusion proteins carrying N-terminal 6XHis tag, which facilitates purification by using metal chelating affinity chromatography under denaturing condition with urea. The recombinant hormones were further refolded by gradually removing the urea. Native gfGH was also purified from goldfish pituitary glands and served as a positive control in the present study. The native and recombinant hormones were tested in goldfish hepatic radioreceptor assay and in vitro Spi 2.1 promoter activation assay.

17317218	Expression in Escherichia coli and in vitro refolding of the plant transcription factor Arabidopsis thaliana RGL3.	Recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana (At) RGL-3, using two vectors pMAL-c2 and pET 21, was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli under a range of temperature conditions. Only low levels (8-120f total protein) of soluble protein were produced. The &quot;soluble&quot; fraction was shown by native PAGE to exist as soluble aggregates of RGL-3. A method was developed, consisting of induction of expression at various temperatures that yielded high levels of refoldable inclusion bodies using the pET vector. (At) RGL-3, as inclusion bodies, was solubilized in 8M urea and refolding was initiated by 20-fold direct dilution of denaturant. Under optimal conditions, 870f the denatured protein of inclusion bodies was successfully re-natured. Refolding was monitored by &quot;native&quot; PAGE. Refolded RGL-3 was shown to be present as monomers and dimers. Attempts to further purify His-tagged RGL-3 using Ni/NTA chromatography resulted in the formation of higher polymers.	2007 Jun	Al-Samarrai Taha H,Kirk Christopher A,Jones William T,Harvey Dawn,Sun Xiaolin	Protein expression and purification. 53(2) 289-92	DELLA protein RGL3	MKRSHQETSVEEEAPSMVEKLENGCGGGGDDNMDEFLAVLGYKVRSSDMADVAQKLEQLEMVLSNDIASSSNAFNDTVHYNPSDLSGWAQSMLSDLNYYPDLDPNRICDLRPITDDDECCSSNSNSNKRIRLGPWCDSVTSESTRSVVLIEETGVRLVQALVACAEAVQLENLSLADALVKRVGLLAASQAGAMGKVATYFAEALARRIYRIHPSAAAIDPSFEEILQMNFYDSCPYLKFAHFTANQAILEAVTTSRVVHVIDLGLNQGMQWPALMQALALRPGGPPSFRLTGVGNPSNREGIQELGWKLAQLAQAIGVEFKFNGLTTERLSDLEPDMFETRTESETLVVNSVFELHPVLSQPGSIEKLLATVKAVKPGLVTVVEQEANHNGDVFLDRFNEALHYYSSLFDSLEDGVVIPSQDRVMSEVYLGRQILNLVATEGSDRIERHETLAQWRKRMGSAGFDPVNLGSDAFKQASLLLALSGGGDGYRVEENDGSLMLAWQTKPLIAASAWKLAAELRR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9LF53			8.4	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
17931885	Cloning, E. coli expression, refolding, and ATP-binding properties of a WD40-deleted Apaf-1 isoform.	The apoptotic protease activating factor (Apaf-1) is central to the regulatory mechanism by which procaspase-9 is activated in the cytochrome c-mediated pathway of apoptosis. For a detailed biochemical and structural investigation of Apaf-1 function, we have cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies the WD40-deleted protein (DeltaWD40 Apaf-1) from HepG2 cell. The construct contains an N-terminal His6 tag derived from the cloning vector so that the mass of the protein and the tag together is 51,594 Da, as determined by TOF/TOF mass spectrometric analysis. An optimized refolding protocol has allowed protein recovery in highly pure form. Basic fluorescence and CD probes indicate that the refolded protein retains secondary and tertiary structures, and unfolds in the presence of higher concentration of denaturant. The equilibrium ATP binding property of the protein has been measured by changes in fluorescence emission due to the fluorescent ATP analog, mant-ATP (2&#39;(3&#39;)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) adenosine 5&#39;-triphosphate). The results demonstrate a tight Apaf-1-ATP interaction, the binding affinity being 380 nM.	2007 Dec	Nageswara Rao P,Yadaiah Madasu,Roy Karnati R,Potu Harish,Bhuyan Abani K	Protein expression and purification. 56(2) 220-8	apoptotic protease activating factor	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDRWIMDAKARNCLLQHREALEKDIKTSYIMDHMISDGFLTISEEEKPTQQQRAAMLIKMILKKDNDSYVSFYNALLHEGYKDLAALLHDGIPVVSSSSGKDSVSGITSYVRTVLCEGGVPQRPVVFVTRKKLVNAIQQKLSKLKGEPGWVTIHGMAGCGKSVLAAEAVRDHSLLEGCFPGGVHWVSVGKQDKSGLLMKLQNLCTRLDQDESFSQRLPLNIEEAKDRLRILMLRKHPRSLLILDDVWDSWVLKAFDSQCQILLTTRDKSVTDSVMGPKYVVPVESSLGKEKGLEILSLFVNMKKADLPEQAHSIIKECKGSPLVVSLIGALLRDFPNRWEYYLKQLQNKQFKRIRKSSSYDYEALDEAMSISVEMLREDIKDYYTDLSILQKDVKVPTKVLCILWDMETEEVEDILQEFV	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O14727			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9341189	Cloning and expression of a gene encoding a protein obtained from earthworm secretion that is a chemoattractant for garter snakes.	The protein ES20, derived from earthworm shock secretion, is a vomeronasally mediated chemoattractant for garter snakes (Jiang, X. C., Inouchi, J., Wang, D., and Halpern, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 8736-8744). Based on its 15-residue N-terminal amino acid sequence, degenerative oligodeoxynucleotide probes were synthesized and used to screen a cDNA library that was constructed in sense orientation using a Uni-ZAPTM XR vector and XL1-Blue MRF&#39; host. A gene was cloned from a polymerase chain reaction as well as from the cDNA library. A combination of the forward degenerative primer and T7 primer was used to obtain gene-specific DNA fragments, from which probes were synthesized and successfully used in screening the cDNA library. The ES20 gene is about 700 base pairs long and encodes 208 amino residues. The ES20 gene was excised from a recombinant plasmid pSK-ES20, ligated to pQE30 expression vector, and transformed into Escherichia coli strain JM109. The selected recombinant plasmids were transformed into expression host cell, E. coli M15[pREP4]. Three transformants were selected, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside for fusion gene expression and an expressed 20-kDa fusion protein purified under denaturing conditions. This protein was refolded and gave a positive reaction against ES20-specific polyclonal antibodies. The fusion protein that had not been denatured remained as an aggregate and was an active chemoattractant for garter snakes.	1997 Oct	Liu W,Wang D,Chen P,Halpern M	The Journal of biological chemistry. 272(43) 27378-81	chemoattractive glycoprotein ES20	mrgsmktylllvflvgahalvcppgftylpagescykvifeshdwhsatercrqesrglaaistpeesiavkefidteiskdsagaavchptgqsgirfwtsglqtkdtctktsfllkitntfevpfdftnwadgeptlprktekfsalivgssertpsgttmtatsscvhsanisndtlkrisvlphlyvgfcdeiwlylnfclisiqili	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O44335			7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16293104	One-step on-column purification and refolding of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody against tumour necrosis factor alpha.	Single-chain variable fragment (scFv) is a low-molecular-mass recombinant antibody and is usually expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Highly efficient purification and refolding methods are required to provide enough active proteins for therapeutic or diagnostic use. In the present study, an anti-TNFalpha (tumour necrosis factor alpha) scFv (TNF-scFv) was constructed and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) star as inclusion bodies, and a convenient procedure of one-step on-column purification and refolding was provided for it. Briefly, denatured TNF-scFv was firstly captured by immobilized metal (Ni) affinity chromatography, and then non-denaturing detergent (Triton X-100)-containing and beta-cyclodextrin-containing solutions were loaded in turn on to the column to perform &#39;artificial chaperone-assisted refolding&#39; after removing impurities. More than 770f denatured TNF-scFv protein was refolded successfully with a purity of more than 95%. Activity assays showed that refolded TNF-scFv could bind to rhTNFalpha (recombinant human TNFalpha) specifically with high affinity. It could inhibit rhTNFalpha from binding to TNF receptors and neutralize the cytolytic activity of rhTNFalpha against L929 cells effectively. A conclusion was obtained that this refolding method is time-saving and suitable for industrial production. It may also be applicable to other scFvs or other recombinant proteins.	2006 Mar	Liu Mengyuan,Wang Xiangbin,Yin Changcheng,Zhang Zhong,Lin Qing,Zhen Yongsu,Huang Hualiang	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 43(Pt 3) 137-45	tumour necrosis factor alpha single-chain variable fragment	QIQLVQSGPELKKPGETVKISCKASGYTFTHYGMNWVKQAPGKGLKWMGWINTYTGEPTYADDFKEHFAFSLETSASTVFLQINNLKNEDTATYFCARERGDAMDYWGQGTSVTVSSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSSIVMTQTPKFLLVSAGDRVTITCTASQSVSNDVVWYQQKPGQSPKMLMYSAFNRYTGVPDRFTGRGYGTDFTFTISSVQAEDLAVYFCQQDYNSPRTFGGGTKLEIKQIPELENNEKAPKVVILKKETAYILSVQAEEQQKLISEEDLLRKRREQLKHKLEQLRNSCAhhhhhh	C-terminal myc tag	A2KBC4			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

Protein refolding is a key step for the production of recombinant proteins, especially at large scales, and usually their yields are very low. Application of liquid chromatography to protein refolding is an exciting step forward for this field. In this work, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) expressed in Escherichia coli was renatured with simultaneous purification by ion exchange chromatography (IEC) with a Q Sepharose FF column. Several chromatographic parameters affecting the refolding yield of the denatured/reduced rhG-CSF, such as the urea concentration, pH value, concentration and ratio of reduced/oxidized glutathione in the mobile phase, as well as the flow rate of the mobile phase, were investigated in detail and indicated that the urea concentration and the pH value were of great importance. At the optimal conditions, the renatured and purified rhG-CSF was found to have a specific bioactivity of 3.0 x 10(8) IU/mg, a purity of 96%, and a mass recovery of 49%.

17718500	Calixarene-assisted protein refolding via liquid-liquid extraction.	In this paper we report on protein refolding by means of a liquid-liquid transfer technique using a calixarene. We have found that a calix[6]areneacetic acid derivative forms a supramolecular complex with urea-denatured cytochrome c at the oil-water interface, which enables quantitative transfer of the protein from an 8 M urea aqueous solution into an organic phase through a proton-exchange mechanism. Denatured cytochrome c is completely separated from the denaturant and is isolated from other denatured cytochrome c molecules to suppress the generation of aggregates due to protein-protein interactions. The recovery of cytochrome c from the organic phase is successfully achieved under acidic conditions using an appropriate amount of 1-butanol. UV-vis, CD, and fluorescence spectroscopic characterizations demonstrate that cytochrome c transferred into a denaturant-free aqueous solution regains its native structure. The reduction kinetics of refolded cytochrome c using ascorbic acid indicates that the protein provides approximately 720f native activity as an electron-transfer protein.	2007 Oct	Shimojo Kojiro,Oshima Tatsuya,Naganawa Hirochika,Goto Masahiro	Biomacromolecules. 8(10) 3061-6	cytochrome c	GDVEKGKKIFVQKCAQCHTVEKGGKHKTGPNLHGLFGRKTGQAPGFTYTDANKNKGITWKEETLMEYLENPKKYIPGTKMIFAGIKKKTEREDLIAYLKKATNE		P00004			7	30	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16302975	Secondary structure assignment of mouse SOCS3 by NMR defines the domain boundaries and identifies an unstructured insertion in the SH2 domain.	SOCS3 is a negative regulator of cytokine signalling that inhibits Janus kinase-signal transduction and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) mediated signal tranduction by binding to phosphorylated tyrosine residues on intracellular subunits of various cytokine receptors, as well as possibly the JAK proteins. SOCS3 consists of a short N-terminal sequence followed by a kinase inhibitory region, an extended SH2 domain and a C-terminal suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) box. SOCS3 and the related protein, cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein, are unique among the SOCS family of proteins in containing a region of mostly low complexity sequence, between the SH2 domain and the C-terminal SOCS box. Using NMR, we assigned and determined the secondary structure of a murine SOCS3 construct. The SH2 domain, unusually, consists of 140 residues, including an unstructured insertion of 35 residues. This insertion fits the criteria for a PEST sequence and is not required for phosphotyrosine binding, as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry. Instead, we propose that the PEST sequence has a functional role unrelated to phosphotyrosine binding, possibly mediating efficient proteolytic degradation of the protein. The latter half of the kinase inhibitory region and the entire extended SH2 subdomain form a single alpha-helix. The mapping of the true SH2 domain, and the location of its C terminus more than 50 residues further downstream than predicted by sequence homology, explains a number of previously unexpected results that have shown the importance of residues close to the SOCS box for phosphotyrosine binding.	2005 Dec	Babon Jeffrey J,Yao Shenggen,DeSouza David P,Harrison Christopher F,Fabri Louis J,Liepinsh Edvards,Scrofani Sergio D,Baca Manuel,Norton Raymond S	The FEBS journal. 272(23) 6120-30	Suppressors of cytokine signalling	MASYHHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGAHDGSlktfsskseyqlvvnavrklqesgfywsavtggeanlllsaepagtflirdssdqrhfftlsvktqsgtknlriqceggsfslqsdprstqpvprfdcvlklvhhymppptpsfslpptepssevpeqppaqalpgstpkrayyiysggekiplvlsrplssn	N terminal hexa His tag + TEV cleavage sequence	P14753		Construct lacks the first 22 residues of SOCS3 and is truncated before the SOCS box motif	6.3	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15571718	Identification of residues important for DNA binding in the full-length human Rad52 protein.	Human Rad52 (HsRad52) is a DNA-binding protein (418 residues) that promotes the catalysis of DNA double strand break repair by the Rad51 recombinase. HsRad52 self-associates to form ring-shaped oligomers as well as higher order complexes of these rings. Analysis of the structural and functional organization of protein domains suggests that many of the determinants of DNA binding lie within the N-terminal 85 residues. Crystal structures of two truncation mutants, HsRad52(1-212) and HsRad52(1-209) support the idea that this region makes up an important part of the DNA binding domain. Here, we report the results of saturating alanine scanning mutagenesis of the N-terminal domain of full-length HsRad52 in which we identify residues that are likely involved in direct contact with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Our results largely agree with the position of side-chains seen in the crystal structures but also suggest that certain DNA binding and cross-subunit interactions differ between the 11 subunit ring in the crystal structures of the truncation mutant proteins versus the seven subunit ring formed by full-length HsRad52.	2005 Jan	Lloyd Janice A,McGrew Dharia A,Knight Kendall L	Journal of molecular biology. 345(2) 239-49	Rad52	MSGTEEAILGGRDSHPAAGGGSVLCFGQCQYTAEEYQAIQKALRQRLGPEYISSRMAGGGQKVCYIEGHRVINLANEMFGYNGWAHSITQQNVDFVDLNNGKFYVGVCAFVRVQLKDGSYHEDVGYGVSEGLKSKALSLEKARKEAVTDGLKRALRSFGNALGNCILDKDYLRSLNKLPRQLPEVDLTKAKRQDLEPSVEEARYNSCRPNM		Q8NG50			7.9	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The extracellular domain of human and rat MOG (ED-MOG) induces experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) when injected into susceptible animals. EAE is a T cell-mediated disease of the central nervous system commonly used as an animal model for human multiple sclerosis. Here, we describe a straightforward procedure for the purification and refolding of mouse and human ED-MOG overexpressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Following solubilization and purification using Ni-NTA resin chromatography under denaturing conditions, a column-based refolding proceeded in renaturation buffer supplemented with a glutathione redox buffer system. Using this approach up to 33 mg of highly pure soluble proteins was obtained per liter of expression culture. The ability of purified proteins to induce EAE was evaluated in three strains of mice. We believe that the strategy described here would facilitate researchers to carry out encephalitogenic as well as structure-function studies of this autoantigen. Additionally, we show for the first time that mouse ED-MOG induces severe disease in mice.	2004 Apr	Liñares David,Echevarria Iñigo,Mañá Paula	Protein expression and purification. 34(2) 249-56	Extracellular domain of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein	MACLWSFSWPSCFLSLLLLLLLQLSCSYAGQFRYIGPGYPIRALVGDEAELPCRISPGKNATGMEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGKDQDAEQAPEYRGRTELLKETISEGKVTLRIGNVRFSDEGGYTCFFRDHSYQEEAAMELKVEDPFYWVNPGVLTLIALVPTILLQVSVGLVFLFLGHRLRGKLRAEVENLHRTFDPHFLRVPCWKITLFVIVPVLGPLVALIICYNWLHRRLAGQFLEELRNPF	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q61885			8	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

16139510	Cloning, purification, and refolding of human paraoxonase-3 expressed in Escherichia coli and its characterization.	Human paraoxonase (hPON3) is a high density lipoprotein-related glycoprotein with multi-enzymatic properties and antioxidant activity which is proposed to participate in the prevention of low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation. In this study, hPON3 gene was amplified from Human Fetal Liver Marathon-Ready cDNA and expressed in Escherichia coli. A majority of the expressed protein existed as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized with Triton X-100 and refolded in vitro. The refolded rhPON3 was purified by DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and its purity was up to 90%. The Km and Vmax values of refolded rhPON3, in respect to phenylacetate hydrolysis were 7.47 +/- 2.14 mM and 66 +/- 17 U/min/mg (n = 3). The Km and Vmax values of refolded rhPON3, in respect to dihydrocoumarin hydrolysis were 0.83 +/- 0.21 mM and 621 +/- 66 U/min/mg (n = 3). The refolded rhPON3 exhibited similar antioxidant activity to that of rhPON3 purified from the soluble fraction of cell lysate and could effectively protect LDL from Cu2+ induced oxidation.	2006 Mar	Lu Haiqin,Zhu Jie,Zang Yuhui,Ze Yuguan,Qin Junchuan	Protein expression and purification. 46(1) 92-9	Human paraoxonase	MGKLVALVLLGVGLSLVGEMFLAFRERVNASREVEPVEPENCHLIEELESGSEDIDILPSGLAFISSGLKPGMPNFAPDEPGKIFLMDLNEQNPRAQALEISGGFDKELFNPHGISIFIDKDNTVYLYVVNHPHMKSTVEIFKFEEQQRSLVYLKTIKHELLKSVNDIVVLGPEQFYATRDHYFTNSLLSFFEMILDLRWTYVLFYSPREVKVVAKGFCSANGITVSADQKYVYVADVAAKNIHIMEKHDNWDLTQLKVIQLGTLVDNLTVDPATGDILAGCHPNPMKLNYNPEDPPGSEVLRIQNVLSEKPRVSTVYANNGSVLQGTSVASVYHGKILIGTVFHKTLYCE	Cloned from Human Liver Marathon-Ready cDNA	P27169			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
17513126	Expression and purification of bioactive high-purity mouse monokine induced by IFN-gamma in Escherichia coli.	MIG (monokine induced by IFN-gamma) is a CXC-chemokine (CXCL9). It plays important roles in regulation of immune activities, and knowledge of the protein in areas of allograft transplants, autoimmune diseases, and cancer therapy is evolving quickly. The non-tagged recombinant murine MIG (rMuMIG) is therefore required to facilitate the functional studies of this important chemokine. Here we present the use of a bacteria expression system to produce non-tagged rMuMIG. The coding sequence for MIG was cloned into the pET28a (+) vector that was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Expression of rMuMIG was induced by IPTG. Bacteria inclusion bodies containing the protein were isolated and washed to remove contaminated bacteria proteins, and resolved in Urea buffer. Renaturation of the denatured protein was carried out in the defined protein refolding buffer, and the refolded protein was purified using S-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography. The final preparation of the rMuMIG was more than 99d0c850ure as measured by capillary electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE analysis. The biological activity of rMuMIG was demonstrated in a murine spleen cell chemotaxis assay with ED50 30 ng/ml. Further experiments showed that rMuMIG could inhibit proliferation of mouse bone marrow cells in vivo.	2007 Sep	Lu Huili,Yu Mei,Sun Ye,Mao Wenwei,Wang Qun,Wu Mingyuan,Han Wei	Protein expression and purification. 55(1) 132-8	Gamma-interferon-induced monokine	TLVIRNARCSCISTSRGTIHYKSLKDLKQFAPSPNCNKTEIIATLKNGDQTCLDPDSANVKKLMKEWEKKINQKKKQKRGKKHQKNMKNRKPKTPQSRRRSRKTT		P18340			6	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
17448483	Effect of sample loop dimension on lysozyme refolding in size-exclusion chromatography.	The formation of misfolded protein aggregates, in particular inclusion bodies, has been widely considered as the major hindrance of good yield in refolding processes. To enhance the performance of protein refolding, extensive efforts were directed toward seeking out methods or means to reduce the aggregate production during the refolding process. Since simultaneous refolding and separation can be feasibly achieved within the packing matrices, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been regarded as an efficient buffer exchange method to enhance protein refolding performance As of now, the effect of the process or operating parameters has yet to be thoroughly investigated. The present work is aimed at understanding how aggregate formation, as well as renaturation yield, varied with the diameter or length of sample loop in size-exclusion chromatography refolding process. Our results showed that not much difference was found in the patterns of aggregate formation for the contraction and the control cases. However, the formation of an additional peak was observed in the expansion cases. In addition, the amount of aggregates was not dependent on the sample loop diameter or length, but instead, influenced by injection volume and protein concentration. It was further concluded that a sample with large volume and low concentration was preferable for refolding process. We believe that the outcome from this work may shed light on the development of a more effective strategy for refolding processes.	2007 Aug	Wang Steven S-S,Chang Che-Kuei,Liu Hwai-Shen	Journal of chromatography.

17024471	Bacterial expression of a Trichosanthes kirilowii defensin (TDEF1) and its antifungal activity on Fusarium oxysporum.	The gene encoding Trichosanthes kirilowii defensin (TDEF1) was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The newly discovered TDEF1 cDNA contains 231 bp (Genbank accession number DQ526373) and encodes a 76-amino acid protein, which consists of a 29-amino acid signal peptide and a 47-amino acid mature peptide. The partial cDNA, corresponding to the mature peptide coding region of TDEF1, was inserted into bacterial expression vector pET32a(+). Subsequent expression showed that TDEF1 was produced as a 26-kDa fusion protein in the form of inclusion body in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). After protein refolding and purification, the fusion TDEF1 displayed an inhibitive activity against the fungal pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum, with EC(50) of 247 microg/ml by means of fungal growth inhibition method.	2007 Feb	Da-Hui Li,Gui-Liang Jian,Ying-Tao Zhang,Tie-Min Ai	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 74(1) 146-51	Trichosanthes kirilowii defensin	RTCQRASQTWKGVCFRNEKCRNNCLREKARTGNCKYVFRACICYFPC	It is known there  are 2-6 disulfide bridges to stabilize the structure.,N-terminal thioredoxin + hexahistidine tag	Q19JA1			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17071104	On-column refolding of recombinant chemokines for NMR studies and biological assays.	We have applied an efficient solid-phase protein refolding method to the milligram scale production of natively folded recombinant chemokine proteins. Chemokines are intensely studied proteins because of their roles in immune system regulation, response to inflammation, fetal development, and numerous disease states including, but not limited to, HIV-1/AIDS, cancer metastasis, Crohn&#39;s disease, asthma and arthritis. Many investigators use recombinant chemokines for research purposes, however these proteins partition almost exclusively to the inclusion body fraction when produced in Escherichia coli. A major hurdle is to correctly refold the chemokine and oxidize the two highly conserved disulfide bonds found in nearly all chemokines. Conventional methods for oxidation and refolding by dialysis or extreme dilution are effective but slow and yield large volumes of dilute chemokine. Here we use an on-column approach for rapid refolding and oxidation of four chemokines, CXCL12/SDF-1alpha (stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha), CCL5/RANTES, XCL1/lymphotactin, and CX3CL1/fractalkine. NMR spectra of SDF-1alpha, RANTES, lymphotactin, and fractalkine indicate these chemokines adopt native structures. On-column refolded SDF-1alpha is fully active in an intracellular calcium flux assay. Our success with multiple SDF-1alpha mutants and members of all four chemokine subfamilies suggests that on-column refolding is a robust method for preparative-scale production of recombinant chemokine proteins.	2007 Mar	Veldkamp Christopher T,Peterson Francis C,Hayes Paulette L,Mattmiller Jessie E,Haugner John C,de la Cruz Norberto,Volkman Brian F	Protein expression and purification. 52(1) 202-9	Stromal cell-derived factor-1a	VSLSYRCPCRFFESHVARANVKHLKILNTPNCALQIVARLKNNNRQVCIDPKLKWIQEYLEKALN	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P48061			6.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

17402759	Protein refolding assisted by periodic mesoporous organosilicas.	Herein we report a new strategy for protein refolding by taking advantage of the unique surface and pore characteristics of ethylene-bridged periodic mesoporous organosilica (PMO), which can effectively entrap unfolded proteins and assist refolding by controlled release into the refolding buffer. Hen egg white lysozyme was used as a model protein to demonstrate the new method of protein refolding. Through loading of denatured proteins inside uniform mesoporous channels tailored to accommodate individual protein, protein aggregation was minimized, and the folding rate was increased. Poly(ethyleneglycol) (PEG)-triggered continuous release of entrapped denatured lysozyme allowed high-yield refolding with high cumulative protein concentrations. The new method enhances the oxidative refolding of lysozyme (e.g., over 80% refolding yield at about 0.6 mg/mL).	2007 May	Wang Xiqing,Lu Diannan,Austin Rebecca,Agarwal Arun,Mueller Leonard J,Liu Zheng,Wu Jianzhong,Feng Pingyun	Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids. 23(10) 5735-9	Hen egg- white lysozyme	MKSAVLFLLGIIFLEQCGVRGTLVIRNARCSCISTSRGTIHYKSLKDLKQFAPSPNCNKTEIIATLKNGDQTCLDPDSANVKKLMKEWEKKINQKKKQKRGKKHQKNMKNRKPKTPQSRRRSRKTT		P00698			8.5	25	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9931005	Solution structure and dynamics of the CX3C chemokine domain of fractalkine and its interaction with an N-terminal fragment of CX3CR1.	Fractalkine, a novel CX3C chemokine, is unusual because of both its membrane-associated structure and its direct role in cell adhesion. We have solved the solution structure of the chemokine domain of fractalkine (residues 1-76) by heteronuclear NMR methods. The 20 lowest energy structures in the ensemble have an average backbone rmsd of 0.43 A, excluding the termini. In contrast to many other chemokines which form homodimers, fractalkine&#39;s chemokine module is monomeric. Comparison of the structure to CC and CXC chemokines reveals interesting differences which are likely to be relevant to receptor binding. These include a bulge formed by the CX3C motif, the relative orientation of the N-terminus and 30&#39;s loop (residues 30-38), and the conformation of the N-loop (residues 9-19). 15N backbone relaxation experiments indicate that these same regions of the protein are dynamic. We also titrated 15N-labeled protein with a peptide from the N-terminus of the receptor CX3CR1 and confirmed that this region of the receptor contacts the fractalkine chemokine domain. Interestingly, the binding site maps roughly to the regions of greatest flexibility and structural variability. Together, these data provide a first glimpse of how fractalkine interacts with its receptor and should help guide mutagenesis studies to further elucidate the molecular details of binding and signaling through CX3CR1.	1999 Feb	Mizoue L S,Bazan J F,Johnson E C,Handel T M	Biochemistry. 38(5) 1402-14	CX3C chemokine fractalkine	QHHGVTKCNITCSKMTSKIPVALLIHYQQNQASCGKRAIILETRQHRLFCADPKEQWVKDAMQHLDRQAAALTRNG		P78423			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14707146	Identification and characterization of a glycosaminoglycan recognition element of the C chemokine lymphotactin.	Chemokine-mediated recruitment of leukocytes in vivo depends on interactions with cell surface glycosaminoglycans. Lymphotactin, the unique member of the &quot;C&quot; chemokine subclass, is a highly basic protein that binds heparin, a glycosaminoglycan, with high affinity (approximately 10 nm). We detected lymphotactin-heparin binding by NMR and mapped this interaction to a narrow surface that wraps around the protein. Substitutions in and around this binding site and surface plasmon resonance analysis of heparin binding affinity identified two arginine residues of lymphotactin as critical for glycosaminoglycan binding. Both arginine mutant proteins and the combined double mutant had dramatically diminished in vivo activity in a leukocyte recruitment assay, suggesting that the lymphotactin-glycosaminoglycan interactions detected in vitro are important for the function of this chemokine. Our results demonstrate that like other chemokines, lymphotactin utilizes highly specific glycosaminoglycan-binding sites that represent potential targets for drug development.	2004 Mar	Peterson Francis C,Elgin E Sonay,Nelson Timothy J,Zhang Fuming,Hoeger Theresa J,Linhardt Robert J,Volkman Brian F	The Journal of biological chemistry. 279(13) 12598-604	CC Chemokine Lymphotactin	MESSGNPESTTFFYYDLQSQPCENQAWVFATLATTVLYCLVFLLSLVGNSLVLWVLVKYESLESLTNIFILNLCLSDLVFACLLPVWISPYHWGWVLGDFLCKLLNMIFSISLYSSIFFLTIMTIHRYLSVVSPLSTLRVPTLRCRVLVTMAVWVASILSSILDTIFHKVLSSGCDYSELTWYLTSVYQHNLFFLLSLGIILFCYVEILRTLFRSRSKRRHRTVKLIFAIVVAYFLSWGPYNFTLFLQTLFRTQIIRSCEAKQQLEYALLICRNLAFSHCCFNPVLYVFVGVKFRTHLKHVLRQFWFCRLQAPSPASIPHSPGAFAYEGASFY	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P46094			8	22	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17980423	Alkaline phosphatase refolding assisted by sequential use of oppositely charged detergents: a new artificial chaperone system.	A novel artificial chaperone system, based on combination of oppositely charged detergents, was elaborated to refold soluble alkaline phosphatase. Upon dilution of urea-denatured alkaline phosphatase to a nondenaturing urea concentration in the presence of the capturing agent, complexes of the detergent and non-native protein molecules are formed and thereby the formation of protein aggregates is prevented. The so-called captured protein is unable to refold from the detergent-protein complex states unless a stripping agent is used to gradually remove the detergent molecules. In that respect, we used detergents with variable charges and tail lengths to initiate and complete the refolding process. The results obtained from various analyses (fluorescence, UV, circular dichroism, surface tension, turbidity measurements and activity assays) indicated that the extent of refolding assistance was different due to detergents structure and also the length of hydrophobic portion of each detergent. These observed differences were attributed to the strong electrostatic interactions among the capturing and stripping detergents used in this investigation. Collectively it is expected that protein refolding process can be achieved easier, cheaper and more efficient, using the new technique reported here.	2008 Mar	Yazdanparast Razieh,Khodagholi Fariba,Souri Effat	International journal of biological macromolecules. 42(2) 195-202	Alkaline phosphatase	LVPVEEEDPAFWNRQAAQALDVAKKLQPIQTAAKNVILFLGDGMGVPTVTATRILKGQMNGKLGPETPLAMDQFPYVALSKTYNVDRQVPDSAGTATAYLCGVKGNYRTIGVSAAARYNQCKTTRGNEVTSVMNRAKKAGKSVGVVTTTRVQHASPAGAYAHTVNRNWYSDADLPADAQMNGCQDIAAQLVNNMDIDVILGGGRKYMFPVGTPDPEYPDDASVNGVRKRKQNLVQAWQAKHQGAQYVWNRTALLQAADDSSVTHLMGLFEPADMKYNVQQDHTKDPTLQEMTEVALRVVSRNPRGFYLFVEGGRIDHGHHDDKAYMALTEAGMFDNAIAKANELTSELDTLILVTADHSHVFSFGGYTLRGTSIFGLAPSKALDSKSYTSILYGNGPGYALGGGSRPDVNDSTSEDPSYQQQAAVPQASETHGGEDVAVFARGPQAHLVHGVEEETFVAHIMAFAGCVEPYTDCNLPAPTTATSIPD		P19111			7	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17115449	A simplified bioprocess for human alpha-fetoprotein production from inclusion bodies.	A simple and effective Escherichia coli (E. coli) bioprocess is demonstrated for the preparation of recombinant human alpha-fetoprotein (rhAFP), a pharmaceutically promising protein that has important immunomodulatory functions. The new rhAFP process employs only unit operations that are easy to scale and validate, and reduces the complexity embedded in existing inclusion body processing methods. A key requirement in the establishment of this process was the attainment of high purity rhAFP prior to protein refolding because (i) rhAFP binds easily to hydrophobic contaminants once refolded, and (ii) rhAFP aggregates during renaturation, in a contaminant- dependent way. In this work, direct protein extraction from cell suspension was coupled with a DNA precipitation-centrifugation step prior to purification using two simple chromatographic steps. Refolding was conducted using a single-step, redox-optimized dilution refolding protocol, with refolding success determined by reversed phase HPLC analysis, ELISA, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Quantitation of DNA and protein contaminant loads after each unit operation showed that contaminant levels were reduced to levels comparable to traditional flowsheets. Protein microchemical modification due to carbamylation in this urea-based process was identified and minimized, yielding a final refolded and purified product that was significantly purified from carbamylated variants. Importantly, this work conclusively demonstrates, for the first time, that a chemical extraction process can substitute the more complex traditional inclusion body processing flowsheet, without compromising product purity and yield. This highly intensified and simplified process is expected to be of general utility for the preparation of other therapeutic candidates expressed as inclusion bodies.	2007 May	Leong Susanna S J,Middelberg Anton P J	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 97(1) 99-117	Alpha-fetoprotein	RTLHRNEYGIASILDSYQCTAEISLADLATIFFAQFVQEATYKEVSKMVKDALTAIEKPTGDEQSSGCLENQLPAFLEELCHEKEILEKYGHSDCCSQSEEGRHNCFLAHKKPTPASIPLFQVPEPVTSCEAYEEDRETFMNKFIYEIARRHPFLYAPTILLWAARYDKIIPSCCKAENAVECFQTKAATVTKELRESSLLNQHACAVMKNFGTRTFQAITVTKLSQKFTKVNFTEIQKLVLDVAHVHEHCCRGDVLDCLQDGEKIMSYICSQQDTLSNKITECCKLTTLERGQCIIHAENDEKPEGLSPNLNRFLGDRDFNQFSSGEKNIFLASFVHEYSRRHPQLAVSVILRVAKGYQELLEKCFQTENPLECQDKGEEELQKYIQESQALAKRSCGLFQKLGEYYLQNAFLVAYTKKAPQLTSSELMAITRKMAATAATCCQLSEDKLLACGEGAADIIIGHLCIRHEMTPVNPGVGQCCTSSYANRRPCFSSLVVDETYVPPAFSDDKFIFHKDLCQAQGVALQTMKQEFLINLVKQKPQITEEQLEAVIADFSGLLEKCCQGQEQEVCFAEEGQKLISKTRAALGV		P02771			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
8961939	Artificial chaperone-assisted refolding of denatured-reduced lysozyme: modulation of the competition between renaturation and aggregation.	Conditions that promote renaturation of an unfolded protein also promote protein aggregation, in many cases, because these competing intramolecular and intermolecular processes are driven by similar networks of noncovalent interactions. The GroEL/GroES system and related biological chaperones facilitate the renaturation of substrate proteins by minimizing the aggregation pathway. We have devised a two-step method in which small molecules, &quot;artificial chaperones,&quot; facilitate protein refolding from a chemically denatured state. In the first step, the protein is captured by a detergent as guanidinium chloride is diluted to a non-denaturing concentration; formation of a protein-detergent complex prevents both protein aggregation and proper refolding. In the second step, a cyclodextrin strips detergent from the protein, allowing the protein to refold. Here we describe the first application of this method to a protein that must form disulfides in the native state. Lysozyme (hen egg white) can be refolded from the Gdm-denatured, DTT-reduced state in good yields at final protein concentrations as high as 1 mg/mL with the artificial chaperone method. Several mechanistic aspects of artificial chaperone-assisted refolding have been probed, and a detailed mechanism for the kinetically controlled stripping step is proposed.	1996 Dec	Rozema D,Gellman S H	Biochemistry. 35(49) 15760-71	Hen egg- white lysozyme	KVFGRCELAAAMKRHGLDNYRGYSLGNWVCAAKFESNFNTQATNRNTDGSTDYGILQINSRWWCNDGRTPGSRNLCNIPCSALLSSDITASVNCAKKIVSDGNGMNAWVAWRNRCKGTDVQAWIRGCRL		P00698			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17304557	Factors affecting protein refolding yields in a fed-batch and batch-refolding system.	The refolding of recombinant protein from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli can present a process bottleneck. Yields at industrially relevant concentrations are restricted by aggregation of protein upon dilution of the denatured form. This article studies the effect of five factors upon the dilution refolding of protein in a twin impeller fed-batch system using refold buffer containing only the oxidized form of the redox reagent. Such a buffer is easier to prepare and more stable than a buffer containing both reduced and oxidized forms. The five factors chosen were: bulk impeller Reynolds number, mini-impeller Reynolds number, injection rate of denatured protein, redox ratio, and guanidine hydrochloride (GdHCl) concentration. A 2(5) factorial experiment was conducted at an industrially relevant protein concentration using lysozyme as the test system. The study identified that in the system used, the guanidine hydrochloride concentration, redox ratio, and injection rate were the most important factors in determining refolding yields. Two interactions were found to be important: redox ratio/guanidine hydrochloride concentration and guanidine hydrochloride concentration/injection rate. Conditions were also found at which high refolding yields could be achieved even with rapid injection and poor mixing efficiency. Therefore, a comparative assessment was carried out with minimal mixing in a simple batch-refolding mode of operation, which revealed different behavior to that of fed-batch. A graphical (windows of operation) analysis of the batch data suggested that optimal yields and productivity are obtained at high guanidine hydrochloride concentrations (1.2 M) and redox ratios of unity or greater.	2007 Aug	Mannall Gareth J,Titchener-Hooker Nigel J,Dalby Paul A	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 97(6) 1523-34	Hen egg- white lysozyme	MKSAVLFLLGIIFLEQCGVRGTLVIRNARCSCISTSRGTIHYKSLKDLKQFAPSPNCNKTEIIATLKNGDQTCLDPDSANVKKLMKEWEKKINQKKKQKRGKKHQKNMKNRKPKTPQSRRRSRKTT		P00698			7	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9852049	Artificial chaperone-assisted refolding of citrate synthase.	The power of genetic engineering methods, along with increasing genomic information, makes heterologous expression of proteins an extremely important biochemical tool. Unfortunately, proteins obtained in this way often are not in their native form, and folding becomes a crucial step in protein production. We have recently developed a strategy that promotes the folding of chemically denatured proteins via the sequential addition of low molecular weight &quot;artificial chaperones.&quot; Here we describe in detail the application of this method to porcine heart citrate synthase. Refolding yields of as high as 65% have been achieved. Mechanistic studies indicate that there are significant differences between artificial chaperone-assisted refolding of citrate synthase and artificial chaperone-assisted refolding of two other proteins that have been examined, carbonic anhydrase B (Rozema, D., and Gellman, S. H. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 3478-3487) and lysozyme (Rozema, D., and Gellman, S. H. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 15760-15771). The differences among these three test proteins reveal the range of procedural variation that must be considered in the application of the artificial chaperone method to new proteins.	1998 Dec	Daugherty D L,Rozema D,Hanson P E,Gellman S H	The Journal of biological chemistry. 273(51) 33961-71	Citrate synthase	ASSTNLKDILADLIPKEQARIKTFRQQHGNTVVGQITVDMMYGGMRGMKGLVYETSVLDPDEGIRFRGYSIPECQKMLPKAKGGEEPLPEGLFWLLVTGQIPTEEQVSWLSKEWAKRAALPSHVVTMLDNFPTNLHPMSQLSAAITALNSESNFARAYAEGIHRTKYWELIYEDCMDLIAKLPCVAAKIYRNLYREGSSIGAIDSKLDWSHNFTNMLGYTDAQFTELMRLYLTIHSDHEGGNVSAHTSHLVGSALSDPYLSFAAAMNGLAGPLHGLANQEVLVWLTQLQKEVGKDVSDEKLRDYIWNTLNSGRVVPGYGHAVLRKTDPRYTCQREFALKHLPHDPMFKLVAQLYKIVPNVLLEQGKAKNPWPNVDAHSGVLLQYYGMTEMNYYTVLFGVSRALGVLAQLIWSRALGFPLERPKSMSTDGLIKLVDSK		P00889			7.6	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18588240	Protein refolding in reversed micelles.	A novel process has been developed which uses reversed micelles to isolate denatured protein molecules from each other and allows them to refold individually. These reversed micelles are aqueous phase droplets stabilized by the surfactant AOT and suspended in isooctane. By adjusting conditions such that only one protein molecule is present per reversed micelle, it was possible to achieve independent folding without encountering the problem of aggregation due to interactions with neighboring molecules. The feasibility of this process was demonstrated using bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A as a model system. It was shown that denatured and reduced ribonuclease can be transferred from a buffered solution containing guanidine hydrochloride into reversed micelles to a greater extent than native enzyme under the same conditions. The denaturant concentration can then be significantly reduced in the reversed micellar phase, while retaining most of the protein, by means of extractive contacting stages with a denaturant-free aqueous solution. Denatured and reduced ribonuclease will subsequently recover full activity inside reversed micelles within 24 h upon addition of a mixture of reduced and oxidized glutathione to reoxidize disulfide bonds. Extraction of this refolded enzyme from reversed micelles back into aqueous solution can be accomplished by contacting the reversed micelle phase with a high ionic strength (1.0M KCl) aqueous solution containing ethyl acetate.	1990 Apr	Hagen A J,Hatton T A,Wang D I	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 35(10) 955-65	Ribonuclease A	MVPPTVEASLESPYTKSYFSPVPSALLEQNDSPIIMGIDEAGRGPVLGPMVYAVAYSTQKYQDETIIPNYEFDDSKKLTDPIRRMLFSKIYQDNEELTQIGYATTCITPLDISRGMSKFPPTRNYNLNEQAHDVTMALIDGVIKQNVKLSHVYVDTVGPPASYQKKLEQRFPGVKFTVAKKADSLYCMVSVASVVAKVTRDILVESLKRDPDEILGSGYPSDPKTVAWLKRNQTSLMGWPANMVRFSWQTCQTLLDDASKNSIPIKWEEQYMDSRKNAAQKTKQLQLQMVAKPVRRKRLRTLDNWYR		P53942			8.7	25	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16875728	Control of aggregation in protein refolding: cooperative effects of artificial chaperone and cold temperature.	Refolding of GuHCl-denatured recombinant-human growth hormone (r-hGH) was investigated in both dilution additive and artificial chaperone assisted modes. In both techniques, it was found that CTAB is a better additive (in dilution mode) or a capturing agent (in artificial chaperone method). Neither of the two techniques was capable of complete inhibition of aggregates formed during refolding process. In dilution, using CTAB or alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) as two different additives, the aggregation was inhibited by almost 55%. However, the extent of inhibition raised to almost 82 0n artificial chaperone assisted mode using CTAB as the capturing and alpha-CD as the stripping agents. Maximum inhibition of aggregation (up to 97%) was obtained when the entire process of refolding was done at 4 degrees C. However, under this temperature program, the far-UV CD and intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the refolded samples were not superimposable on their respective native spectra. The spectra superimposibilities were obtained when the refolding process was achieved under a well worked out temperature program: incubation of the sample for 3 min at 4 degrees C after initiation of the stripping step followed by overnight incubation at 22 degrees C. Based on these data, it is expected that higher activity recovery yields of recombinant proteins, particularly at relatively higher protein concentrations, could be achieved by getting a better molecular understanding of major factors responsive for aggregation and refolding pathways.	2007 Jan	Yazdanparast Razieh,Esmaeili Mohammad Ali,Khodagholi Fariba	International journal of biological macromolecules. 40(2) 126-33	Growth Hormone	FPTIPLSRLFDNAMLRAHRLHQLAFDTYQEFEEAYIPKEQKYSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNREETQQKSNLELLRISLLLIQSWLEPVQFLRSVFANSLVYGASDSNVYDLLKDLEEGIQTLMGRLEDGSPRTGQIFKQTYSKFDTNSHNDDALLKNYGLLYCFRKDMDKVETFLRIVQCRSVEGSCGF		P01241			7	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
11866875	Expression and purification of catalytic domain of human macrophage elastase for high throughput inhibitor screening.	AIM:To obtain a catalytically active human macrophage elastase catalytic domain (hMECD) and to establish an efficient high-throughput method for screening macrophage elastase inhibitors.METHODS:Catalytic domain of human macrophage elastase was expressed in E coli and characterized to establish a high-throughput screening assay using a colorimetric method. A set of 8560 pure compounds and mixtures were screened.RESULTS:We have constructed an efficient E coli system for this human protein expression, and the recombinant hMECD protein was purified to homogeneity using anion-exchange chromatography after in vitro refolding from inclusion bodies. The yield of active hMECD protein was 23 mg from one liter of E coli culture after purification. Calcium and zinc ions were required both in refolding and enzymatic activity, but high concentration of zinc inhibited the refolding and activity. The hMECD cleaved several synthetic substrates including a chromogenic thiopeptolide and fluorogenic peptides with optimal activity around pH 8.0. Screening of 8560 compounds and mixtures led to identify 27 pure compounds and 14 natural products with inhibitory activity higher than 80 % at 20 mg/L.CONCLUSION:An efficient expression and purification method for hMECD protein has been established, and the assay is effective, reliable, and fast in identifying the recombinant protein inhibitors.	2002 Feb	Cheng Dong-Hang,Shen Qiang,Qian Jing,Qian Zhen,Ye Qi-Zhuang	Acta pharmacologica Sinica. 23(2) 143-51	Human macrophage elastase catalytic  domain	GPVWRKHYITYRINNYTPDMNREDVDYAIRKAFQVWSNVTPLKFSKINTGMADILVVFARGAHGDFHAFDGKGGILAHAFGPGSGIGGDAHFDEDEFWTTHSGGTNLFLTAVHEIGHSLGLGHSSDPKAVMFPTYKYVDINTFRLSADDIRGIQSLYGDPKENQRLPNPDNSEPALCDPNLSFDAVTTVGNKIFFFKDRFFWLKVSERPKTSVNLISSLWPTLPSGIEAAYEIEARNQVFLFKDDKYWLISNLRPEPNYPKSIHSFGFPNFVKKIDAAVFNPRFYRTYFFVDNQYWRYDERRQMMDPGYPKLITKNFQGIGPKIDAVFYSKNKYYYFFQGSNQFEYDFLLQRITKTLKSNSWFGC		P39900		catalytic domain	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
17959407	Purification and detailed study of two clinically different human glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants, G6PD(Plymouth) and G6PD(Mahidol): Evidence for defective protein folding as the basis of disease.	In an attempt to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency caused by two mutations, G6PD(Plymouth) (G163D) and G6PD(Mahidol) (G163S), the two variants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in G6PD-deficient E. coli DF 213 cells. A first indication of impaired folding came from problems in expressing these clinical mutants, which were only overcome by lowering the growth temperature or co-expressing with molecular chaperones (GroEL and GroES). Both strategies significantly increased soluble expression of recombinant G6PD(Plymouth) and G6PD(Mahidol), judged by both G6PD activity in extracts and the amount of immunoreactive protein. Using a modified 3-step protocol, the two mutant enzymes were successfully purified for the first time. Steady-state kinetic parameters (K(m) for NADP(+), K(m) for G6P and k(cat)) of the two mutants are very similar to the wild-type values, indicating that the catalytic efficiency of the two mutants remains unchanged. The two mutants are, however, markedly less stable than wild-type G6PD in both thermostability and urea-induced inactivation tests. In a typical experiment at 37 degrees C and pH 7.2 after 24h G6PD WT, G6PD(Mahidol) and G6PD(Plymouth) retained 58.3%, 27.0% and 3.9%, respectively, of their corresponding initial activity. The stability of all three enzymes is enhanced by addition of NADP(+). According to unfolding and refolding experiments, the two mutants are impaired in their folding properties. Thus structural instability appears to be the molecular basis of the clinical phenotype in G6PD(Plymouth) and G6PD(Mahidol) and in particular of the differing clinical severity of the two mutations. The 3-D structure solved for G6PD(Canton) allows an interpretation of these effects in terms of steric hindrance.	2008 Jan	Huang Yuxiang,Choi Mei Yee,Au Shannon Wing Ngor,Au Deborah Man Yee,Lam Veronica Min Sien,Engel Paul C	Molecular genetics and metabolism. 93(1) 44-53	Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase	AEQVALSRTQVCGILREELFQGDAFHQSDTHIFIIMGASGDLAKKKIYPTIWWLFRDGLLPENTFIVGYARSRLTVADIRKQSEPFFKATPEEKLKLEDFFARNSYVAGQYDDAASYQRLNSHMNALHLGSQANRLFYLALPPTVYEAVTKNIHESCMSQIGWNRIIVEKPFGRDLQSSDRLSNHISSLFREDQIYRIDHYLGKEMVQNLMVLRFANRIFGPIWNRDNIACVILTFKEPFGTEGRGGYFDEFGIIRDVMQNHLLQMLCLVAMEKPASTNSDDVRDEKVKVLKCISEVQANNVVLGQYVGNPDGEGEATKGYLDDPTVPRGSTTATFAAVVLYVENERWDGVPFILRCGKALNERKAEVRLQFHDVAGDIFHQQCKRNELVIRVQPNEAVYTKMMTKKPGMFFNPEESELDLTYGNRYKNVKLPDAYERLILDVFCGSQMHFVRSDELREAWRIFTPLLHQIELEKPKPIPYIYGSRGPTEADELMKRVGFQYEGTYKWVNPHKL		P11413			7.4	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15698956	Taiwan cobra chymotrypsin inhibitor: cloning, functional expression and gene organization.	A cDNA encoding chymotrypsin inhibitor was constructed from the cellular RNA isolated from the venom glands of Naja atra (Taiwan cobra). The resultant amino acid sequence showed that the mature protein is comprised of 57 amino acid residues with six cysteine residues. Cloned protein was expressed and isolated from the inclusion bodies of E. coli and refolded into a functional protein in vitro. Deleting the first three residues at its N-terminus caused a moderate increase in the inhibitory constant (K(i)) against chymotrypsin. The genomic DNA encoding the chymotrypsin inhibitor was amplified by PCR. The gene shares virtually an identical structural organization with the beta-bungarotoxin B1 chain (a snake Kunitz/BPTI neurotoxic homolog) gene. Moreover, the overall sequence identity of the N. atra chymotrypsin inhibitor and beta-bungarotoxin B1 chain genes was up to 83%. These findings strongly suggest that snake Kunitz/BPTI protease inhibitors and neurotoxic homologs may have originated from a common ancestor.	2005 Mar	Cheng Yun-Ching,Yan Fang-Jiun,Chang Long-Sen	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1747(2) 213-20	Chymotrypsin inhibitor	RPRFCELAPSAGSCFAFVPSYYYNQYSNTCHSFTYSGCGGNANRFRTIDECNRTCVG		Q5ZPJ7			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8080282	Expression and partial characterization of Dolichos biflorus seed lectin in Escherichia coli.	The seed lectin from the legume, Dolichos biflorus, was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET expression vector. Replacement of the 22-amino acid signal sequence of this lectin with a methionine increased the level of lectin expression greater than 100-fold. Approximately 200f the expressed seed lectin was soluble; the remainder was solubilized in 8 M urea and renatured by rapid dilution. No difference in physicochemical properties or activity was detected between the soluble and renatured forms. NH2-terminal amino acid analysis and immunoblots, using antibodies that recognize the COOH-terminus of only the nontruncated subunit of the native heteroligomer, established that the expressed lectin has a primary structure equivalent to subunit I of the native seed lectin. The expressed seed lectin is active as evidenced by its ability to bind to blood group A + H substance-Sepharose and to be specifically eluted from this column with N-acetylgalactosamine. However, a comparison of the activity of the expressed lectin with the native seed lectin using a sensitive ELISA showed that the expressed lectin has a slightly lower affinity for blood group A + H substance than the native seed lectin. The expressed lectin also had a lower M(r) than the seed lectin as determined by molecular exclusion chromatography.	1994 Sep	Chao Q,Casalongue C,Quinn J M,Etzler M E	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 313(2) 346-50	Lectin	ANIQSFSFKNFNSPSFILQGDATVSSGKLQLTKVKENGIPTPSSLGRAFYSSPIQIYDKSTGAVASWATSFTVKISAPSKASFADGIAFALVPVGSEPRRNGGYLGVFDSDVYNNSAQTVAVEFDTFSNSGWDPSMKHIGIDVNSIKSIATVSWDLANGENAEILITYNAATSLLVASLVHPSRRTSYILSERVDITNELPEYVSVGFSATTGLSEGYIETHDVLSWSFASKLPDDSTAEPLDLASYLVRNVL		P05045			7.3	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15733576	Cloning and expression of a novel cDNA encoding a mannose-binding lectin from Dendrobium officinale.	Using RNA extracted from Dendrobium officinale young leaves and primers designed according to the conservative regions of orchidaceae lectins, the full-length cDNA of Dendrobium officinale agglutinin2 (DOA2) was cloned by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full-length cDNA of doa2 was 777 bp and contained a 513 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a lectin precursor of 170 amino acids. Through comparative analysis of doa2 gene and its deduced amino acid sequence with those of other orchidaceae species and Amaryllidaceae species, it was found that DOA2 had many common characters of mannose-binding lectin superfamily including three mannose-binding sites. Semi-Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that doa2 mRNA expression was detected in all tested tissues including root, stem and leaf, however, the expression was higher in stem, and lower in leaf. As the doa2 mRNA was detected in all the tested plant tissues, the doa2 was considered to be a constitutively expressed gene. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli and purified. Anti-fungal assay showed that DOA2 has anti-fungal activity towards Gibberella zeae. To our knowledge, this is the first report on cDNA cloning of mannose binding lectin from Dendrobium officinale.	2005 Mar	Chen Zhonghai,Sun Xiaofen,Tang Kexuan	Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology. 45(4) 535-40	Mannose-binding lectin	DNHLLPGDRLNPGNFLKQDRYMLIMQEDCNLVLYNLNKPEWATKTANRGSRCFVTLQSDGNFVIYDDHEERNEAIWASNTDGQNGNYVIILQKDGNLVLYSKPIFATGTNRFGSTAVVVAKRNRKAHFGVEQNIIEVTTNL		Q3L635			5.4	28	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15479236	Cloning, expression and interaction of human T-cell receptors with the bacterial superantigen SSA.	Superantigens (SAgs) are a class of disease-causing and immunostimulatory proteins of bacterial or viral origin that activate a large number of T-cells through interaction with the Vbeta domain of T-cell receptors (TCRs). In this study, recombinant TCR beta chains were constructed with human variable domains Vbeta5.2, Vbeta1 and Vbeta2.1, expressed as inclusion bodies, refolded and purified. The Streptococcus pyogenes SAg SSA-1 was cloned and expressed as a soluble periplasmic protein. SSA-1 was obtained both as a monomer and a dimer that has an intermolecular disulfide bond. We analyzed the biological activity of the recombinant SAgs by proliferation assays. The results suggest that SSA dimerization occludes the TCR interaction site. Naturally occurring SSA dimerization was also observed in supernatants of S. pyogenes isolates. An SSA mutant [SSA(C26S)] was produced to eliminate the Cys responsible for dimerization. Affinity assays using a resonant biosensor showed that both the mutant and monomeric wild type SSA have affinity for human Vbeta5.2 and Vbeta1 with Kd of 9-11 microm with a fast kass and a moderately fast kdiss. In spite of the reported stimulation of Vbeta2.1 bearing T-cells by SSA, we observed no measurable interaction.	2004 Oct	De Marzí Mauricio C,Fernández Marisa M,Sundberg Eric J,Molinero Luciana,Zwirner Norberto W,Llera Andrea S,Mariuzza Roy A,Malchiodi Emilio L	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 271(20) 4075-83	T-cell receptor	GVSQNPRHNITKRGQNVTFRCDPISEHNRLYWYRQTLGQGPEFLTYFQNEAQLEKSRLLSDRFSAERPKGSFSTLEIQRTEQGDSAMYLCASSLAGLNQPQHFGDGTRLSIL		P04435			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

12509986	Purification and characterization of catalytic domains of gelatinase A with or without fibronectin insert for high-throughput inhibitor screening.	Gelatinase A represents an attractive therapeutic target for cancer invasion and metastasis. In order to screen for gelatinase A inhibitors, we have cloned, overexpressed in a bacterial system, and purified the catalytic domain of human gelatinase A with (GaCDfn) or without (GaCD) fibronectin-like insert. GaCDfn and GaCD were purified to homogeneity and refolded in vitro. GaCDfn was refolded to a stable and active form in the presence of calcium and zinc ions. GaCD was refolded through direct dialysis against Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer without calcium and zinc ions. GaCD is unstable in the presence of calcium and zinc ions. The enzymatic activities of GaCDfn and GaCD require calcium and zinc ions, but high concentration of zinc and calcium ions inhibited the activities. The GaCDfn and GaCD cleaved several synthetic substrates including a chromogenic thiopeptolide (TPL) and fluorogenic peptides with optimal activity around pH 7.5. Moreover, GaCDfn and GaCD cleave gelatin and collagen VII and display similar cleavage patterns on the gel, but the digestion rate of these protein substrates by GaCD is apparently slower than GaCDfn. EDTA, 1,10-phenanthroline, and reference inhibitors potently blocked GaCDfn and GaCD enzymatic activities. A set of 3596 compounds from our center collection were screened by using GaCDfn and GaCD to cleave TPL. Further analysis by using MMP inhibitors indicated there is a correlation between IC(50) values on GaCDfn and GaCD. A few compounds with selectivity toward gelatinase A catalytic domain were identified for structure modification.	2003 Jan	Cheng Donghang,Shen Qiang,Nan Fajun,Qian Zhen,Ye Qi-Zhuang	Protein expression and purification. 27(1) 63-74	 Human Gelatinase A	YNFFPRKPKWDKNQITYRIIGYTPDLDPETVDDAFARAFQVWSDVTPLRFSRIHDGEADIMINFGRWEHGDGYPFDGKDGLLAHAFAPGTGVGGDSHFDDDELWTLGEGQVVRVKYGNADGEYCKFPFLFNGKEYNSCTDTGRSDGFLWCSTTYNFEKDGKYGFCPHEALFTMGGNAEGQPCKFPFRFQGTSYDSCTTEGRTDGYRWCGTTEDYDRDKKYGFCPETAMSTVGGNSEGAPCVFPFTFLGNKYESCTSAGRSDGKMWCATTANYDDDRKWGFCPDQGYSLFLVAAHEFGHAMGLEHSQDPGALMAPIYTYTKNFRLSQDDIKGIQELYGASPDIDLGTGPTPTLGPVTPEICKQDIVFDGIAQIRGEIFFFKDRFIWRTVTPRDKPMGPLLVATFWPELPEKIDAVYEAPQEEKAVFFAGNEYWIYSASTLERGYPKPLTSLGLPPDVQRVDAAFNWSKNKKTYIFAGDKFWRYNEVKKKMDPGFPKLIADAWNAIPDNLDAVVDLQGGGHSYFFKGAYYLKLENQSLKSVKFGSIKSDWLGC		P08253			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

8549827	Expression and folding of an interleukin-2-proinsulin fusion protein and its conversion into insulin by a single step enzymatic removal of the C-peptide and the N-terminal fused sequence.	We report the expression in E. coli of a proinsulin fusion protein carrying a modified interleukin-2 N-terminal peptide linked to the N-terminus of proinsulin by a lysine residue. The key aspects investigated were: (a) the expression of the fused IL2-PI gene, (b) the folding efficiency of the insulin precursor when still carrying the N-fused peptide and (c) the selectivity of the enzymatic cleavage reaction with trypsin in order to remove simultaneously the C-peptide and the N-terminal extension. It was found that this construction expresses the chimeric proinsulin at high level (20%) as inclusion bodies; the fused protein was refolded at 100-200 micrograms/ml to yield about 800f correctly folded proinsulin and then it was converted into insulin by prolonged reaction (5 h) with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B at a low enzyme/substrate rate (1:600). This approach is based on a single enzymatic reaction for the removal of both the N-terminal fused peptide and the C-peptide and avoids the use of toxic cyanogen bromide.	1996 Jan	Castellanos-Serra L R,Hardy E,Ubieta R,Vispo N S,Fernandez C,Besada V,Falcon V,Gonzalez M,Santos A,Perez G,Silva A,Herrera L	FEBS letters. 378(2) 171-6	Interleukin-2	MYRMQLLSCIALSLALVTNSAPTSSSTKKTQLQLEHLLLDLQMILNGINNYKNPKLTRMLTFKFYMPKKATELKHLQCLEEELKPLEEVLNLAQSKNFHLRPRDLISNINVIVLELKGSETTFMCEYADETATIVEFLNRWITFCQSIISTLT		P60568			10.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15751949	Illustration of HIV-1 protease folding through a molten-globule-like intermediate using an experimental model that implicates alpha-crystallin and calcium ions.	The folding of HIV-1 protease to its active form involves the coordination of structure formation and dimerization, which follows a hierarchy consisting of folding nuclei spanning from the active site, hinge region, and dimerization domain. However, the biochemical characteristics of the folding intermediates of this protein remain to be elucidated. In an experimental model, the denaturation of the tethered dimer of HIV-1 protease by guanidine hydrochloride revealed an alternative conformation resembling the molten-globule state. The molten-globule state binds to the molecular chaperone alpha-crystallin and prevents its aggregation; however, the chaperone alone failed to reconstitute HIV-1 protease into its active form. Calcium ion assisted in the release of active enzyme from the chaperone complex. Alpha-crystallin, a member of the small heat-shock protein, assists proteins to fold correctly; however, the underlying principle of signals responsible for chaperone-mediated protein folding remains enigmatic. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy has been employed to provide the evidence of calcium binding to alpha-crystallin and to decipher the effect of calcium binding on the chaperone-mediated refolding of HIV-1 protease. On the basis of our spectroscopic data, we propose that calcium ions interact with the carboxyl groups of the surface-exposed acidic amino acids of alpha-crystallin bringing electrostatic interference, which plays a pivotal role in inducing conformational changes in the chaperone responsible for the release of the active enzyme.	2005 Mar	Dash Chandravanu,Sastry Murali,Rao Mala	Biochemistry. 44(10) 3725-34	HIV protease	PQITLWQRPLVTIKIGGQLKEALLDTGADDTVLEEMSLPGRWKPKMIGGIGGFIKVRQYDQILIEICGHKAIGTVLVGPTPVNIIGRNLLTQIGCTLNF		P03366			6	28	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
18215068	Pea seed lectin folds and oligomerizes via an intermediate not represented in the structural hierarchy.	Large oligomeric proteins are usually thought to fold and assemble hierarchically: Domains fold and coalesce to form the subunits, and folded subunits can then associate to form the multimeric structure. We have investigated the refolding pathway of the beta-sheet protein pea seed lectin using spectroscopic and hydrodynamic techniques. In vivo, it is proteolytically processed post-translationally, so that the single-domain subunits of the initial homodimer themselves become heterodimers of intertwined fragment polypeptide chains. Despite this complex topology, mature pea seed lectin reassembles with considerable efficiency at low total protein concentration (10 mug/mL) and low temperature (10 degrees C), albeit very slowly (t1/2 approximately 2 days). Contrary to expectations, the primary assembly product is not the intact beta-sheet domain, but the larger fragment chains first dimerize to form the native-like subunit interface. The smaller fragment chains then associate with this preformed dimer.	2008 Feb	Küster Frank,Seckler Robert	Biochemistry. 47(8) 2458-65	Lectin	TNIEALSFNFPKITPGNTAITLQGNAKILANGVLALTNSTQIPPTTTFPSTGRALYSTPVPLWDSATGNVASFVTSFSFVILNPSGRVPTDGLVFFIAPPDTEIPNNSQSQYLGVVDSKTSINRFVGLEFDLYANSFDPYMRHIGIDINSLISTKTVRYNFVSGSLTKVTIIYDSPSNTLTAVITYENGQISTISQNVDLKAVLPKDVSVGFSATSTIAVSHNIHSWSFTSNLEATTGNIVSQV		P16270			6.8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
18204739	Cloning and purification of functionally active Fas ligand interfering protein (FIP) expressed in Escherichia coli.	This report presents purification and characterization of the extracellular domain of rat Fas protein, called FIP (FasL interfering protein), expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. FIP was extracted from the inclusion bodies, solubilized with 8 M urea, purified by a single-step immobilized metal ion (Ni(2+)) affinity chromatography and refolded. SDS/PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis of the purified protein verified its purity. Fluorescence spectrum analysis showed that the refolding procedure caused structural changes which presumably might have led to oligomerization. The purified FIP has biological activities: it binds specifically soluble Fas ligand and protects human Jurkat lymphocytes against FasL-dependent apoptosis. This efficient procedure of FIP expression in E. coli and renaturation may be useful for production of therapeutically important proteins.	2008 	Wisniewski Pawel,Master Adam,Kaminska Bozena	Acta biochimica Polonica. 55(1) 51-6	Fas ligand interfering protein	MQQPVNYPCPQIYWVDSSATSPWAPPGSVFSCPSSGPRGPGQRRPPPPPPPPSPLPPPSQPPPLPPLSPLKKKDNIELWLPVIFFMVLVALVGMGLGMYQLFHLQKELAELREFTNHSLRVSSFEKQIANPSTPSETKKPRSVAHLTGNPRSRSIPLEWEDTYGTALISGVKYKKGGLVINEAGLYFVYSKVYFRGQSCNSQPLSHKVYMRNFKYPGDLVLMEEKKLNYCTTGQIWAHSSYLGAVFNLTVADHLYVNISQLSLINFEESKTFFGLYKL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag +c terminal solubilization enhancing domain (SED)	P36940			7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
18189135	Expression and purification of human urodilatin by small ubiquitin-related modifier fusion in Escherichia coli.	To prevent in vivo degradation, small peptides are usually expressed in fusion proteins from which target peptides can be released by proteolytic or chemical reagents. In this report, small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) linked with a hexa-histidine tag was used as a fusion partner for the production of recombinant human urodilatin, a hormone for the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure. The fusion protein, which was overexpressed mainly as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, constituted about 250f the total cell proteins. After purification by Ni-sepharose affinity chromatography and renaturation in refolding buffer, the fusion protein was cleaved with SUMO protease 1. Urodilatin was separated from the fusion partner by the subtractive chromatography using Ni-sepharose once again, and then further purified with reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. In vitro activity assay demonstrated that the recombinant urodilatin had a potent vasodilatory effect on rabbit aortic strips with an EC50 of 1.77+/-0.53 microg/ml, which was similar to that of the synthetic urodilatin standard. The expression strategy presented in this study allows convenient high yield and easy purification of small recombinant peptides with native sequences.	2008 Mar	Sun Ziyong,Xia Zhinan,Bi Feng,Liu Jian-Ning	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 78(3) 495-502	Urodilatin	TAPRSLRRSSCFGGRMDRIGAQSGLGCMSFRY	N-terminal small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)				8.5	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18197673	Successful control of aggregation and folding rates during refolding of denatured lysozyme by adding N-methylimidazolium cations with various N&#39;-substituents.	The present study aimed to obtain more effective refolding agents and to understand the influence of their chemical structures on their function as refolding agents. To achieve these aims, we investigated the effects of a large variety of N&#39;-substituted N-methylimidazolium chlorides on the oxidative refolding of lysozyme in a high throughput manner. Among the molecules examined, N-methylimidazolium cations with a short N&#39;-alkyl chain, such as an N&#39;-ethyl or N&#39;-butyl chain, significantly enhanced the refolding yield compared to conventional refolding additives such as arginine hydrochloride and Triton X-100. Detailed kinetic analyses revealed that the effective cations selectively decreased the aggregation rate constant (kA) without any large decreases in the folding rate constant (kN). However, when the hydrophobicity of the N&#39;-substituent of the cations was increased, the desirable properties of the short N&#39;-alkyl chain-type cations for protein refolding were diminished. Furthermore, increases in the N&#39;-alkyl chain length to an N&#39;-octyl or N&#39;-dodecyl chain drastically decreased the kA values, thereby increasing the ratio of kN to kA, despite the very small kN values and resulting in enhanced refolding yields. Thus, by tuning the chemical structure of the N&#39;-substituents of N-methylimidazolium chloride, five effective refolding agents (N&#39;-ethyl-, N&#39;-propyl-, N&#39;-butyl-, N&#39;-pentyl- and N&#39;-isobutyl-N-methylimidazolium chlorides) were successfully obtained, and the kinetic parameters of folding and aggregation during the refolding process could be controlled using three different modes.

18155676	Simultaneous refolding, purification and immobilization of xylanase with multi-walled carbon nanotubes.	Multi-walled carbon nanotubes were used as refolding aid for xylanase unfolded with 8 M urea. The hydrophobic surface of the nanotubes enabled the binding, refolding, purification and simultaneous immobilization of the enzyme. While 55% activity could be regained while working with the denatured form of a purified preparation of xylanase, 92% activity could be obtained with the commercial preparation of xylanase in 8 M urea. These activities were obtained with refolded xylanase bound to the carbon nanotubes. Hence an immobilization efficiency of 0.92 was observed. The FT-IR spectroscopy showed that alpha-helical content of xylanase decreased from 170 14%, beta-sheet content increased from 530 61% and beta-turns decreased from 200 150pon immobilization on the nanotubes. The refolded xylanase molecule bound to the carbon nanotube gave various secondary structure contents very similar to the bound (to carbon nanotubes) native xylanase.	2008 Feb	Shah Shweta,Gupta Munishwar N	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1784(2) 363-7	xylanase	KVTAAFAGLLVTAFAPPVPEPVLVSRSAGINYVQNYNGNLGDFTYDESAGTFSMYWEDGVSSDFVVGLGWTTGSSNAITYSAEYSASGSSSYLAVYGWVNYLRLNTTSSRITVITTLAARPQALVPSTLMEAPTKSAPTLELTNRPSREQARSRSTSPFERARAHLER		Q12550			5	25	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18080912	Overexpression, effective renaturation, and bioactivity of novel single-chain antibodies against TNF-alpha.	Neutralization of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) has become an effective therapeutic strategy for TNF-related autoimmune diseases. Due to the limitations of the large molecular inhibitors in the therapy, development of novel TNF-alpha inhibitors is very attractive and useful. In this study, based on the previously designed domain antibody, two novel human anti-TNF single-chain antibodies were constructed using modular consensus frameworks of human antibody as scaffold to display the antagonistic peptides. A variety of expression plasmids were used to determine the optimal expression system. The single-chain antibodies were always overexpressed in E.coli BL21(DE3) host as inclusion bodies. Under the optimized refolding conditions, the inclusion bodies were renatured successfully and the refolded single-chain antibodies could bind with TNF-alpha and block TNF-induced cytotoxicity on L929 cells. The bioactivity of the single-chain antibodies was significantly increased over the domain antibody.	2008 	Geng Shusheng,Chang Hong,Qin Weisong,Li Yan,Feng Jiannan,Shen Beifen	Preparative biochemistry &amp; biotechnology. 38(1) 74-86	anti-Tumor necrosis factor single chain Fv		C-terminal hexahistidine tag					4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Surface antigen 1 (SAG1) of Toxoplasma gondii is a good candidate for diagnosis and vaccine development, but recombinant SAG1 produced in Escheichia coli often loses its specific immunogenicity due to the incorrect folding. In the present study, a truncated SAG1 was highly expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein, about 300f the total protein of the cell lysate. After a simple purification and refolding procedure, purified rSAG1 can be recognized by human Toxoplasma-infective serum, and ELISA kits constructed by rSAG1 can sensitively and specifically detect toxoplasma infection.	2001 Oct	Chen X G,Gong Y,Hua-Li ,Lun Z R,Fung M C	Protein expression and purification. 23(1) 33-7	Surface antigen protein 1	MFPKAVRRAVTAGVFAAPTLMSFLRCGVMASDPPLVANQVVTCPDKKSTAAVILTPTENHFTLKCPKTALTEPPTLAYSPNRQICSAGTTSSCTSKAVTLSSLIPEAEDSWWTGDSASLDTAGIKLTVPIEKFPVTTQTFVVGCIKGDDAQSCMVTVTVQARASSVVNNVARCSYGANSTLGPVKLSAEGPTTMTLVCGKDGVKVPQDNNQYCSGTTLTGCNEKSFKDILPKLTENPWQGNASSDKGATLTIKKEAFPAESKSVIIGCTGGSPEKHHCTVKLEFAGAAGPAKSAAGTASHVSIFAMVIGLIGSFAACVA	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	A9JQX3			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

10049901	Inhibition of plant-pathogenic fungi by a corn trypsin inhibitor overexpressed in Escherichia coli.	The cDNA of a 14-kDa trypsin inhibitor (TI) from corn was subcloned into an Escherichia coli overexpression vector. The overexpressed TI was purified based on its insolubility in urea and then refolded into the active form in vitro. This recombinant TI inhibited both conidium germination and hyphal growth of all nine plant pathogenic fungi studied, including Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, and Fusarium moniliforme. The calculated 50 0nhibitory concentration of TI for conidium germination ranged from 70 to more than 300 microgram/ml, and that for fungal growth ranged from 33 to 124 microgram/ml depending on the fungal species. It also inhibited A. flavus and F. moniliforme simultaneously when they were tested together. The results suggest that the corn 14-kDa TI may function in host resistance against a variety of fungal pathogens of crops.	1999 Mar	Chen Z Y,Brown R L,Lax A R,Cleveland T E,Russin J S	Applied and environmental microbiology. 65(3) 1320-4	Trypsin Inhibitor (TI)	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMSAGTSCVPGWAIPHNPLPSCRWYVTSRTCGIGPRLPWPELKRRCCRELADIPAYCRCTALSILMDGAIPPGPDAQLEGRLEDLPGCPREVQRGFAATLVTEAECNLATIS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P01088			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

We have developed a procedure for the quantitative refolding of the Link module from human tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene 6. This significantly simplifies the previously described method of production of this protein domain (Day et al., Protein Expression Purif. 8, 1-16, 1996). The refolding is carried out under nondenaturing conditions at pH 6.0 in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of beta-mercaptoethanol. After 2 days the starting material, which consists of three species that differ only with respect to their disulfide bond organization, has rearranged to give a single homogeneous species with the correct disulfide bridges. This method allows the production of about 20 mg of folded protein per liter of Escherichia coli culture.	1997 Apr	Kahmann J D,Koruth R,Day A J	Protein expression and purification. 9(3) 315-8	Link module from human TSG-6	GVYHREARSGKYKLTYAEAKAVCEFEGGHLATYKQLEAARKIGFHVCAAGWMAKGRVGYPIVKPGPNCGFGKTGIIDYGIRLNRSERWDAYCYNPHAK		P98066			6	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

18230606	The intermediate domain defines broad nucleotide selectivity for protein folding in Chlamydophila GroEL1.	The chaperonin GroEL assists protein folding in the presence of ATP and magnesium through substrate protein capsulation in combination with the cofactor GroES. Recent studies have revealed the details of folding cycles of GroEL from Escherichia coli, yet little is known about the GroEL-assisted protein folding mechanisms in other bacterial species. Using three model enzyme assays, we have found that GroEL1 from Chlamydophila pneumoniae, an obligate human pathogen, has a broader selectivity for nucleotides in the refolding reaction. To elucidate structural factors involved in such nucleotide selectivity, GroEL chimeras were constructed by exchanging apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains between E. coli GroEL and C. pneumoniae GroEL1. In vitro folding assays using chimeras revealed that the intermediate domain is the major contributor to the nucleotide selectivity of C. pneumoniae GroEL1. Additional site-directed mutation experiments led to the identification of Gln(400) and Ile(404) in the intermediate domain of C. pneumoniae GroEL1 as residues that play a key role in defining the nucleotide selectivity of the protein refolding reaction.	2008 Apr	Okuda Hiroshi,Sakuhana Chihaya,Yamamoto Risa,Mizukami Yuko,Kawai Rika,Sumita Yusuke,Koga Motoki,Shirai Mutsunori,Matsuda Kazuhiko	The Journal of biological chemistry. 283(14) 9300-7	10 kDa chaperonin groES protein	MSDQATTLRIKPLGDRILVKREEEEATARGGIILPDTAKKKQDRAEVLVLGTGKRTDDGTLLPFEVQVGDIILMDKYAGQEITIDDEEYVILQSSEIMAVLK	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P31682			7	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

To elucidate structural factors involved in such nucleotide selectivity, GroEL chimeras were constructed by exchanging apical, intermediate, and equatorial domains between E. coli GroEL and C. pneumoniae GroEL1. In vitro folding assays using chimeras revealed that the intermediate domain is the major contributor to the nucleotide selectivity of C. pneumoniae GroEL1. Additional site-directed mutation experiments led to the identification of Gln(400) and Ile(404) in the intermediate domain of C. pneumoniae GroEL1 as residues that play a key role in defining the nucleotide selectivity of the protein refolding reaction.	2008 Apr	Okuda Hiroshi,Sakuhana Chihaya,Yamamoto Risa,Mizukami Yuko,Kawai Rika,Sumita Yusuke,Koga Motoki,Shirai Mutsunori,Matsuda Kazuhiko	The Journal of biological chemistry. 283(14) 9300-7	60 kDa chaperonin groEL protein	MAAKNIKYNEEARKKIHKGVKTLAEAVKVTLGPKGRHVVIDKSFGSPQVTKDGVTVAKEIELEDKHENMGAQMVKEVASKTADKAGDGTTTATVLAEAIYSEGLRNVTAGANPMDLKRGIDKAVKVVVDELKKISKPVQHHKEIAQVATISANNDSEIGNLIAEAMEKVGKNGSITVEEAKGFETVLDVVEGMNFNRGYLSSYFSTNPETQECVLEDALILIYDKKISGIKDFLPVLQQVAESGRPLLIIAEEIEGEALATLVVNRLRAGFRVCAVKAPGFGDRRKAMLEDIAILTGGQLVSEELGMKLENTTLAMLGKAKKVIVTKEDTTIVEGLGNKPDIQARCDNIKKQIEDSTSDYDKEKLQERLAKLSGGVAVIRVGAATEIEMKEKKDRVDDAQHATIAAVEEGILPGGGTALVRCIPTLEAFLPMLANEDEAIGTRIILKALTAPLKQIASNAGKEGAIICQQVLARSANEGYDALRDAYTDMIDAGILDPTKVTRSALESAASIAGLLLTTEALIADIPEEKSSSAPAMPSAGMDY	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P31681			7	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

18249008	Refolding of G protein alpha subunits from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli.	Heterotrimeric G proteins relay signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the interior of the cell. The signaling cascades induced by G protein activation control a wide range of cellular processes. The alpha subunit is believed to determine which G protein couples to each GPCR, and is the primary determinant of the type of signal transmitted. Several members of the G(alpha) family have been expressed in active form in Escherichia coli. However, production levels of these proteins are limited: in most cases only approximately 100f total G(alpha) protein expressed is active; the rest accumulates in inclusion bodies. Although G(ialpha) has been readily expressed in soluble form (to 10 mg/L), other alpha subunits are minimally soluble, and many are exclusively expressed to inclusion bodies. Previous efforts to solubilize and refold G(alpha) from inclusion bodies have not been successful. Here we did a thorough study of the characteristics of G(alpha) subunits (human G(ialpha(1)), human G(salpha(short)), human G(11alpha) and human G(talpha(cone))), solubilized and purified from inclusion bodies. We find that we can obtain soluble protein both by on-column and rapid-dilution techniques. Comparison to native, soluble G(ialpha) expressed from E. coli showed that although the refolded G(alpha) subunits were soluble and retained partial alpha-helicity characteristic of the native, folded G(alpha) subunit, they did not bind GDP or GTP as effectively as native protein. We conclude that the refolded G(ialpha) protein has a native-like secondary structure, but is predominantly in a molten globular state.	2008 Apr	McCusker Emily,Robinson Anne Skaja	Protein expression and purification. 58(2) 342-55	G protein-coupled receptor G alpha subunit		N-terminal hexahistidine tag				8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Inclusion body refolding processes play a major role in the production of recombinant proteins. Improvement of the size-exclusion chromatography refolding process was achieved by combining a decreasing urea gradient with an increasing arginine gradient (two gradients) for the refolding of NTA protein (a new thrombolytic agent) in this paper. Different refolding methods and different operating conditions in two gradients gel filtration process were investigated with regard to increasing the NTA protein activity recovery and inhibition of aggregation. The refolding of denatured NTA protein showed this method could significantly increase the activity recovery of protein at high protein concentration. The activity recovery of 37% was obtained from the initial NTA protein concentration up to 20 mg/ml. The conclusions presented in this study could also be applied to the refolding of lysozyme.	2008 Apr	Fan Xiangdong,Xu Diansheng,Lu Bing,Xia Jie,Wei Dongzhi	Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods. 70(6) 1130-8	New thrombolytic agent						8.5	0	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

18179225	High recovery refolding of rhG-CSF from Escherichia coli, using urea gradient size exclusion chromatography.	Protein folding liquid chromatography (PFLC) is a powerful tool for simultaneous refolding and purification of recombinant proteins in inclusion bodies. Urea gradient size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is a recently developed protein refolding method based on the SEC refolding principle. In the presented work, recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) expressed in Escheriachia coli (E. coli) in the form of inclusion bodies was refolded with high yields by this method. Denatured/reduced rhG-CSF in 8.0 mol.L(-1) urea was directly injected into a Superdex 75 column, and with the running of the linear urea concentration program, urea concentration in the mobile phase and around the denatured rhG-CSF molecules was decreased linearly, and the denatured rhG-CSF was gradually refolded into its native state. Aggregates were greatly suppressed and rhG-CSF was also partially purified during the refolding process. Effects of the length and the final urea concentration of the urea gradient on the refolding yield of rhG-CSF by using urea gradient SEC were investigated respectively. Compared with dilution refolding and normal SEC with a fixed urea concentration in the mobile phase, urea gradient SEC was more efficient for rhG-CSF refolding--in terms of specific bioactivity and mass recovery, the denatured rhG-CSF could be refolded at a larger loading volume, and the aggregates could be suppressed more efficiently. When 500 microL of solubilized and denatured rhG-CSF in 8.0 mol.L(-1) urea solution with a total protein concentration of 2.3 mg.mL(-1) was loaded onto the SEC column, rhG-CSF with a specific bioactivity of 1.0 x 10(8) IU.mg(-1) was obtained, and the mass recovery was 46.1%.

18267367	Overexpression, on-column refolding and isotopic labeling of Hahellin from Hahella chejuensis, a putative member of the betagamma-crystallin superfamily.	A gene which encodes a hypothetical protein of 40 kDa has been identified in the genome of a marine bacterium Hahella chejuensis, as a putative member of betagamma-crystallin superfamily. This hypothetical protein contains a putative betagamma-crystallin-like domain, along with other domains for carbohydrate binding regions. It is named as Hahellin. A PCR amplified stretch of 92-amino acid residue long protein was cloned into pET21a vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. The recombinant Hahellin, produced as inclusion bodies, was estimated to be around 500f the total cellular protein content which was solubilized in 8 M urea. The protein was purified and refolded using an anion exchange column. The MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry revealed the purity and monomeric nature of the protein. Further, a method to prepare isotopically (15N/13C) labeled protein with high yield for NMR studies is reported. The uniformly 15N-labeled Hahellin thus produced has been characterized by recording a sensitivity enhanced 2D [15N]-[1H] HSQC spectrum. The well, dispersed peaks in the spectrum confirm that the protein is indeed well folded and suitable for further studies by NMR.	2008 Apr	Srivastava Atul K,Sharma Yogendra,Chary Kandala V R	Protein expression and purification. 58(2) 269-74	Hahellin	MISSHWRKHFLAISVAAGAALSHAVFAAENLAHMQPVTTSSIESSDLSGYMAVDGDANTRWGSAYGGTAWIYVDLGEKRSISRVKLLWEAAYAKAYDLQVSNDASTWTTVRSVTNADGDIDDLTNLNASGRYVRIKGIKRGTEYGYSLWELEVYGPASGGDGEKTVKLYEDTHFKGYSVELPVGDYNLSSLISRGALNDDLSSARVPSGLRLEVFQHNNFKGVRDFYTSDAAELSRDNDASSVRVSKMETTNGDSDDFPDWRSGHNYVEGNIVRYKGKLYIAVHPNPGYDPVISHWFWDEYRGDDDGGDSDDGSDNGASCSAINSWNEANLTNYESYPDPNSEECIKYNGCQWAGQFAGLDGVQPESWVKAHNIAAVHSKDFNWLNGKTLRLRQGDKEIDVVVYDMCSDSDCDGCCTQNLGRTGYLIDIEKYTMQRFGTGHGDVQWQVCD					9.5	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18261477	Sub-domains of the dystrophin rod domain display contrasting lipid-binding and stability properties.	Dystrophin is a muscle scaffolding protein that establishes a structural link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Despite the large body of knowledge about the dystrophin gene and its interactions, the functional importance of the large central rod domain remains highly controversial. It is composed of 24 spectrin-like repeats interrupted by four hinges that delineate three sub-domains. We express repeat 1-3 and repeat 20-24 sub-domains, delineated by hinges 1-2 and 3-4 and the single repeats 2 and 23. We determine their lipid-binding properties, thermal and urea stabilities and refolding velocities. By using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography, we show that repeat 2 and the repeat 1-3 sub-domain strongly interact with anionic lipids. By contrast, repeat 23 and the repeat 20-24 sub-domain do not interact with lipids. In addition, the repeat 1-3 sub-domain and repeat 2 are dramatically less stable and refold faster than the repeat 20-24 sub-domain and repeat 23. The contrasting properties of the two sub-domains clearly indicate that they make up two units of the rod domain that are not structurally interchangeable, thus providing molecular evidence supporting the observations on the biological function of dystrophin.	2008 Apr	Legardinier Sébastien,Hubert Jean-François,Le Bihan Olivier,Tascon Christophe,Rocher Chantal,Raguénès-Nicol Céline,Bondon Arnaud,Hardy Serge,Le Rumeur Elisabeth	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1784(4) 672-82	Dystrophin	LEASSDQWKRLHLSLQELLVWLQLKDDELSRQAPIGGDFPAVQKQNDVHRAFKRELKTKEPVIMSTLETVRIFLTEQPLEGLEKLYQEPRELPPEERAQNVTRLLRKQAEEVNTEWEKLNLHSADWQRKIDETLERLQEL	N-terminal +C terminal Glycine-serine dipeptide	P11532		R23	7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14722093	Analysis of the regulation of the molecular chaperone Hsp26 by temperature-induced dissociation: the N-terminal domail is important for oligomer assembly and the binding of unfolding proteins.	Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are molecular chaperones that efficiently bind non-native proteins. All members of this family investigated so far are oligomeric complexes. For Hsp26, an sHsp from the cytosol of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has been shown that at elevated temperatures the 24-subunit complex dissociates into dimers. This dissociation seems to be required for the efficient interaction with unfolding proteins that results in the formation of large, regular complexes comprising Hsp26 and the non-native proteins. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of this chaperone, we analyzed the dynamics and stability of the two oligomeric forms of Hsp 26 (i.e. the 24-mer and the dimer) in comparison to a construct lacking the N-terminal domain (Hsp26DeltaN). Furthermore, we determined the stabilities of complexes between Hsp26 and non-native proteins. We show that the temperature-induced dissociation of Hsp26 into dimers is a completely reversible process that involves only a small change in energy. The unfolding of the dissociated Hsp26 dimer or Hsp26DeltaN, which is a dimer, requires a much higher energy. Because Hsp26DeltaN was inactive as a chaperone, these results imply that the N-terminal domain is of critical importance for both the association of Hsp26 with non-native proteins and the formation of large oligomeric complexes. Interestingly, complexes of Hsp26 with non-native proteins are significantly stabilized against dissociation compared with Hsp26 complexes. Taken together, our findings suggest that the quaternary structure of Hsp26 is determined by two elements, (i) weak, regulatory interactions required to form the shell of 24 subunits and (ii) a strong and stable dimerization of the C-terminal domain.	2004 Mar	Stromer Thusnelda,Fischer Elke,Richter Klaus,Haslbeck Martin,Buchner Johannes	The Journal of biological chemistry. 279(12) 11222-8	Heat shock protein 26	sFNSPFFDFFDNINNEVDAFNRLLGEGGLRGYAPRRQLANTPAKDSTGKEVARPNNYAGALYDPRDETLDDWFDNDLSLFPSGFGFPRSVAVPVDILDHDNNYELKVVVPGVKSKKDIDIEYHQNKNQILVSGEIPSTLNEESKDKVKVKESSSGKFKRVITLPDYPGVDADNIKADYANGVLTLTVPKLKPQKDGKNHVKKIEVSSQESWGN	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P15992			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17962224	Folding of an antibody variable domain in two functional conformations in vitro: calorimetric and spectroscopic study of the anti-ferritin antibody VL domain.	Understanding refolding pathways of recombinant antibody fragments is essential for efficient production of these proteins of high biomedical significance. The recombinant VL domain of mouse anti-human ferritin antibody F11 formed two distinct functional conformations obtained by refolding from bacterial inclusion bodies using two different procedures. Involvement of a dialysis step at pH 2-3 resulted in the VL-1 conformation with fluorescence of the highly conserved Trp-35 residue quenched by the spatially proximal disulfide bond. This conformation was identical to the &#39;native&#39; VL domain folded in host cells and purified from the cytoplasm. In the absence of the acidic dialysis step, the VL domain adopted a previously unreported conformation, VL-2, that demonstrated prominent fluorescence due to a local structural disorder around Trp-35. Furthermore, VL-2 showed changes in secondary structure and significantly lower stability as determined by differential scanning calorimetry and denaturant-induced unfolding. While more flexible VL-2 binds human ferritin both in solution and after surface adsorption of the antibody domain, the VL-1 conformer needs an adsorption-induced conformational change to allow the access of ferritin to the antigen-binding site. Noteworthy, the two macroscopic conformations constitute kinetically trapped dimers and do not interconvert at elevated temperatures (3 weeks at 37 degrees C or 15 min at 60 degrees C), which indicates a high energetic barrier between them. As a major finding, this paper provides the first description for two stable and functional conformations of an antibody domain.	2007 Oct	Tsybovsky Yaroslav,Shubenok Denis V,Kravchuk Zinaida I,Martsev Sergey P	Protein engineering, design &amp; selection : PEDS. 20(10) 481-90	Anti-human ferritin antibody F11 VL domain		C-terminal hexahistidine tag			VL-1 domain	2	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

17981102	Renaturation, purification and characterization of streptokinase expressed as inclusion body in recombinant E. coli.	Recombinant protein purification is facilitated using high expression systems which produce larger quantities of streptokinase protein as inclusion bodies. As the accumulation of active streptokinase is toxic to the host cells, we have optimized the conditions to achieve large amounts of streptokinase in the form of inclusion bodies. The solubility and yield of pure protein are highly dependent on various combinations of chemical additives, ionic and non-ionic detergents and salts, with solubilizing agents followed by refolding of denatured protein into active form. As the extraction of the purified streptokinase from inclusion bodies requires denaturation and a subsequent refolding step, careful balancing steps were needed to develop under different controlled conditions. Here the purified fragments of refolded proteins were screened to select the conditions that yield the active streptokinase having native conformation. The maximum specific activity of the purified streptokinase was achieved by these methods. The refolded recombinant streptokinase was analyzed by RP-HPLC showing a purity of 99%. Size exclusion chromatography profile shows that there are minimal aggregates in the active streptokinase protein and the percentage of renaturation is around 99%.	2008 Jan	Cherish Babu P V,Srinivas V K,Krishna Mohan V,Krishna Ella	Journal of chromatography.

16214138	The dimer interface of the SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein adapts a porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus-like structure.	We have employed NMR to investigate the structure of SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein dimer. We found that the secondary structure of the dimerization domain consists of five alpha helices and a beta-hairpin. The dimer interface consists of a continuous four-stranded beta-sheet superposed by two long alpha helices, reminiscent of that found in the nucleocapsid protein of porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus. Extensive hydrogen bond formation between the two hairpins and hydrophobic interactions between the beta-sheet and the alpha helices render the interface highly stable. Sequence alignment suggests that other coronavirus may share the same structural topology.	2005 Oct	Chang Chung-ke,Sue Shih-Che,Yu Tsan-hung,Hsieh Chiu-Min,Tsai Cheng-Kun,Chiang Yen-Chieh,Lee Shin-jye,Hsiao Hsin-Hao,Wu Wen-Jin,Chang Chi-Fon,Huang Tai-huang	FEBS letters. 579(25) 5663-8	Nucleoprotein Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus	TKKSAAEASKKPRQKRTATKQYNVTQAFGRRGPEQTQGNFGDQDLIRQGTDYKHWPQIAQFAPSASAFFGMSRIGMEVTPSGTWLTYHGAIKLDDKDPQFKDNVILLNKHIDAYKTFP	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P59595			7.4	1	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18272180	Order-disorder-order transitions mediate the activation of cholera toxin.	Cholera toxin (CT) holotoxin must be activated to intoxicate host cells. This process requires the intracellular dissociation of the enzymatic CTA1 domain from the holotoxin components CTA2 and B5, followed by subsequent interaction with the host factor ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6)-GTP. We report the first NMR-based solution structural data for the CT enzymatic domain (CTA1). We show that this free enzymatic domain partially unfolds at the C-terminus and binds its protein partners at both the beginning and the end of this activation process. Deviations from random coil chemical shifts (Delta delta(coil)) indicate helix formation in the activation loop, which is essential to open the toxin&#39;s active site and occurs prior to its association with human protein ARF6. We performed NMR titrations of both free CTA1 and an active CTA1:ARF6-GTP complex with NAD(+), which revealed that the formation of the complex does not significantly enhance NAD(+) binding. Partial unfolding of CTA1 is further illustrated by using 4,4&#39;-bis(1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulfonate) fluorescence as an indicator of the exposed hydrophobic character of the free enzyme, which is substantially reduced when bound to ARF6-GTP. We propose that the primary role of ARF6&#39;s allostery is to induce refolding of the C-terminus of CTA1. Thus, as a folded globular toxin complex, CTA1 escapes the chaperone and proteasomal components of the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway in the cytosol and then proceeds to ADP ribosylate its target G(s)alpha, triggering the downstream events associated with the pathophysiology of cholera.	2008 Mar	Ampapathi Ravi S,Creath Andrea L,Lou Dianne I,Craft John W,Blanke Steven R,Legge Glen B	Journal of molecular biology. 377(3) 748-60	Cholera enterotoxin subunit A [Precursor]	NDDKLYRADSRPPDEIKQSGGLMPRGQSEYFDRGTQMNINLYDHARGTQTGFVRHDDGYVSTSISLRSAHLVGQTILSGHSTYYIYVIATAPNMFNVNDVLGAYSPHPDEQEVSALGGIPYSQIYGWYRVHFGVLDEQLHRNRGYRDRYYSNLDIAPAADGYGLAGFPPEHRAWREEPWIHHAPPGCGNAPRSS		P01555		Subunit A1	7.2	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
18272180	Order-disorder-order transitions mediate the activation of cholera toxin.	Cholera toxin (CT) holotoxin must be activated to intoxicate host cells. This process requires the intracellular dissociation of the enzymatic CTA1 domain from the holotoxin components CTA2 and B5, followed by subsequent interaction with the host factor ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6)-GTP. We report the first NMR-based solution structural data for the CT enzymatic domain (CTA1). We show that this free enzymatic domain partially unfolds at the C-terminus and binds its protein partners at both the beginning and the end of this activation process.

17636383	Aspergillus niger lipase: gene cloning, over-expression in Escherichia coli and in vitro refolding.	From the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the lipase from Aspergillus niger F044, a potential homologous gene A84689 to the lipanl (the gene encoding the lipase from Aspergillus niger F044) was identified. A pair of primers were designed according to the nucleotide sequence of A84689, and the lipanl was cloned by PCR. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the lipanl has an ORF of 1,044 bp, containing three introns. The deduced amino acid sequence corresponds to 297 amino acid residues. The cloned cDNA fragment encoding the mature lipase from Aspergillus niger F044 was over-expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(De3) and the recombinant protein was refolded in vitro by dilution followed by DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography.	2007 Dec	Shu Zheng-Yu,Yan Yun-Jun,Yang Jiang-Ke,Xu Li	Biotechnology letters. 29(12) 1875-9	Triacylglycerol lipase	SVSTSTLDELQLFAQWSAAAYCSNNIDSDDSNVTCTADACPSVEEASTKMLLEFDLTNNFGGTAGFLAADNTNKRLVVAFRGSSTIKNWIADLGFILQDNDDLCTGCKVHTGFWKAWEAAADNLTSKIKSAMSTYSGYTLYFTGHSLGGALATLGATVLRNDGYSVELYTYGCPRVGNYALAEHITSQGSGANFRVTHLNDIVPRLPPMDFGFSQPSPEYWITSGTGASVTASDIELIEGINSTAGNAGEATVDVLAHLWYFFAISECLL		Q0ZAX7			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17523923	Identification of an oxidative refolding intermediate of recombinant consensus interferon from inclusion bodies and design of a two-stage strategy to promote correct disulfide-bond formation.	Dilution refolding of recombinant consensus IFN (interferon) from inclusion bodies suffers from low yield. A stable intermediate was found to mix with the correct product and to have an antiviral activity of less than 100f the latter. This intermediate would form precipitates upon removal of the precipitation inhibitor arginine. Compared with the native protein, the intermediate moved more slowly on non-reducing SDS/PAGE. The CD and fluorescence spectra indicated that it had formed a native-like structure, but had only one disulfide bond: Cys(29)-Cys(139). Further evidence showed that the formation of Cys(29)-Cys(139) is specific and very likely to happen, even in the presence of a high concentration of reducing agent, whereas pairing of the other disulfide (Cys(1)-Cys(99)) needed a stronger oxidative condition. It competed with intermolecular disulfide bonding to form covalent oligomers. On the basis of this discovery, a two-stage refolding step strategy was designed that employed a modified dilution refolding step followed by a dialysis refolding step. The first stage used a high concentration of reducing agent together with the precipitation inhibitor arginine. The purpose was to hinder any reaction through Cys(1) or Cys(99) but allow the intramolecular disulfide bonding of Cys(29)-Cys(139). The second stage was a dialysis step that gradually increased the oxidative agent concentration and simultaneously decreased the arginine concentration. The refolding yield was increased from 35 to 82%, while the mass recovery was increased from 60 to 96%. Moreover, this strategy could suppress precipitation even after arginine was completely removed.	2007 Dec	Liu Yong-Dong,Zhang Gui-Feng,Li Jing-Jing,Chen Jing,Wang Yin-Jue,Ding Hong,Su Zhi-Guo	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 48(Pt 4) 189-98	Interferon regulatory factor 8	MCDRNGGRRLRQWLIEQIDSSMYPGLIWENEEKSMFRIPWKHAGKQDYNQEVDASIFKAWAVFKGKFKEGDKAEPATWKTRLRCALNKSPDFEEVTDRSQLDISEPYKVYRIVPEEEQKCKLGVATAGCVNEVTEMECGRSEIDELIKEPSVDDYMGMIKRSPSPPEACRSQLLPDWWAQQPSTGVPLVTGYTTYDAHHSAFSQMVISFYYGGKLVGQATTTCPEGCRLSLSQPGLPGTKLYGPEGLELVRFPPADAIPSERQRQVTRKLFGHLERGVLLHSSRQGVFVKRLCQGRVFCSGNAVVCKGRPNKLERDEVVQVFDTSQFFRELQQFYNSQGRLPDGRVVLCFGEEFPDMAPLRSKLILVQIEQLYVRQLAEEAGKSCGAGSVMQAPEEPPPDQVFRMFPDICASHQRSFFRENQQITV		Q02556			8.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
16931044	A newly proposed mechanism for arginine-assisted protein refolding--not inhibiting soluble oligomers although promoting a correct structure.	Arginine has been demonstrated to be capable of suppressing aggregation during protein refolding. However, the pathway and the mechanism for arginine to participate in and to assist refolding process still remains unclear. In this study, arginine-assisted refolding of recombinant consensus interferon (rIFN-con1) was investigated. It was found that although arginine minimized the formation of protein precipitate, it failed to prevent the formation of the soluble oligomeric species. The amount of the oligomers increased with the increase in arginine concentration. This phenomenon has not been reported. On the other hand, arginine was able to promote the yield of correctly refolded rIFN-con1, which was more than 2 times higher than that in the absence of arginine. A proposed mechanism is the stabilization of different soluble species by arginine, which slowed down the conformational movement. The stabilization effect on native-like structure formation overwhelmed the oligomeric promotion effect, which resulted in a composite effect of increased refolding yield for rIFN-con1 when arginine concentration was below 0.5M.	2007 Feb	Liu Yong-Dong,Li Jing-Jing,Wang Fang-wei,Chen Jing,Li Peng,Su Zhi-Guo	Protein expression and purification. 51(2) 235-42	Interferon regulatory factor 8	MCDRNGGRRLRQWLIEQIDSSMYPGLIWENEEKSMFRIPWKHAGKQDYNQEVDASIFKAWAVFKGKFKEGDKAEPATWKTRLRCALNKSPDFEEVTDRSQLDISEPYKVYRIVPEEEQKCKLGVATAGCVNEVTEMECGRSEIDELIKEPSVDDYMGMIKRSPSPPEACRSQLLPDWWAQQPSTGVPLVTGYTTYDAHHSAFSQMVISFYYGGKLVGQATTTCPEGCRLSLSQPGLPGTKLYGPEGLELVRFPPADAIPSERQRQVTRKLFGHLERGVLLHSSRQGVFVKRLCQGRVFCSGNAVVCKGRPNKLERDEVVQVFDTSQFFRELQQFYNSQGRLPDGRVVLCFGEEFPDMAPLRSKLILVQIEQLYVRQLAEEAGKSCGAGSVMQAPEEPPPDQVFRMFPDICASHQRSFFRENQQITV		Q02556			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
17513375	Kinetic refolding barrier of guanidinium chloride denatured goose delta-crystallin leads to regular aggregate formation.	Delta-crystallin is the major soluble protein in avian eye lenses with a structural role in light scattering. Dissociation and unfolding of the tetrameric protein in guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) can be sensitively monitored by the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. In this study refolding of GdmCl-denatured delta-crystallin was investigated. A marked hysteresis was observed while refolding by dilution of the 5 M GdmCl-denatured delta-crystallin. The secondary structure of the refolded protein was largely restored. However, monitoring intrinsic fluorescence of single tryptophan mutants indicated that the microenvironment of domain 1 (W74) was not restored. The region containing W169, which is close to the dimer interface, remained exposed following refolding. During refolding of the wild-type protein, dimeric, tetrameric, and aggregate forms were identified. The ratio of tetramer to dimer increased with time, as judged by gel-filtration chromatography and nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. However the observed levels of tetramer did not return to the same levels as observed before GdmCl treatment. The proportion of tetramer was significantly decreased in the N-25 deletion mutant and it did not increase with time. These results suggest that there is a kinetic barrier for assembly of dimers into tetramers. The consequence of this is that dimers refold to form aggregates. Aggregation seems to follow a nucleation mechanism with an apparent reaction order of 4.7+/-0.2, suggesting four or five monomers constitute the core structure of nucleus, which propagate to form high molecular weight aggregates. Addition of alpha-crystallin during refolding prevents aggregation. Thioflavin T and Congo red assays indicated a regular structure for the protein aggregates, which appear as hollow tubules packed into helical bundles. Aggregate formation was protein concentration dependent that progressed via two stages with rate constants of 0.0039+/-0.0006 and 0.00043+/-0.00003 s(-1), respectively. We propose that the N-terminal segment of delta-crystallin plays a critical role in proper double dimer assembly and also in the assembly of nucleus to aggregate formation.	2007 Aug	Yin Fon-Yi,Chen Ya-Huei,Yu Chung-Ming,Pon Yu-Chin,Lee Hwei-Jen	Biophysical journal. 93(4) 1235-45	Delta crystallin (Argininosuccinate lyase)	MASEGDKLMGGRFVGSTDPIMQMLSTSMSTEQRLSEVDIQASIAYAKALEKAGILTKTELEKILSGLEKISEEWSKGVFVVTQSDEDIHTANERRLKELIGDIAGKLNTGRSRNEQVVTDLKLFMKNSLSVISTHLLQLIKTLVERAAIEIDVILPGYTHLQKAQPIRWSQFLLSHAVALTRDSERLGEVKRRINVLPLGSGALAGNPLDIDREMLRSELDFASISLNSMDAISERDFVVEFLSVATLLMIHLSKMAEDLIIYSTSEFGFLTLSDAFSTGSSLMPQKKNPDSLELIRSKAGRVFGRLASILMVLKGLPSTYNKDLQEDKEAVFDVVDTLTAVLQVATGVISTLQISKENMEKALTPEMLSTDLALYLVRKGMPFRQAHTASGKAVHLAETKGITINNLTLEDLKSISPLFSSDVSQVFNFVNSVEQYTAMGGTAKSSVTTQIEHLRELMKKQKEQA		P33110			7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
17616428	Role of the linker between the N- and C-terminal domains in the stability and folding of rabbit muscle creatine kinase.	Domain-domain interactions may be very important to the structure and functions of many multidomain proteins. However, little is known about the role of the linker in the folding, stability and function of multidomain proteins. In this research, muscle creatine kinase (CK), a dimeric two-domain protein, was used as a model protein to investigate the role of the linker in CK activity, stability and folding by mutational analysis. Two of the three mutations, L115D and L121D, resulted in a gradual decrease in CK activity and secondary structures, but did not affect CK inactivation induced by heat or guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl). The mutations also caused much more serious aggregation during heat- and GdnHCl-induced denaturation and refolding from the GdnHCl-denatured state. More importantly, none of the three mutants could successfully recover their activities by dilution-initiated refolding, and the rate constant of CK refolding was gradually decreased by the mutations. These results suggested that mutations of the hydrophobic residues in the linker might affect the correct positioning of the domains and thus disrupt the efficient recognition and interactions between the two domains. The results herein indicated that in addition to its role in the in vivo functions, the linker also played a crucial role in the stability and folding of CK.	2007 	He Hua-Wei,Feng Shan,Pang Min,Zhou Hai-Meng,Yan Yong-Bin	The international journal of biochemistry &amp; cell biology. 39(10) 1816-27	Creatine kinase M-type	MPFGNTHNKYKLNYKSEEEYPDLSKHNNHMAKVLTPDLYKKLRDKETPSGFTLDDVIQTGVDNPGHPFIMTVGCVAGDEESYTVFKDLFDPIIQDRHGGFKPTDKHKTDLNHENLKGGDDLDPHYVLSSRVRTGRSIKGYTLPPHCSRGERRAVEKLSVEALNSLTGEFKGKYYPLKSMTEQEQQQLIDDHFLFDKPVSPLLLASGMARDWPDARGIWHNDNKSFLVWVNEEDHLRVISMEKGGNMKEVFRRFCVGLQKIEEIFKKAGHPFMWNEHLGYVLTCPSNLGTGLRGGVHVKLAHLSKHPKFEEILTRLRLQKRGTGGVDTAAVGSVFDISNADRLGSSEVEQVQLVVDGVKLMVEMEKKLEKGQSIDDMIPAQK		P00563			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17944937	Identification of three phases in Onconase refolding.	Onconase is an extremely stable member of the RNase A superfamily. The increase in the thermodynamic stability by 20 kJ x mol(-1) in comparison to RNase A was expected to result in altered folding behavior. Despite the lack of cis-Pro residues in native Onconase, refolding at low concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride was complex and showed three kinetic phases (fast, medium, and slow), with rate constants differing by a factor of about 10 each. None of the phases could be accelerated by peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases, pointing to the absence of kinetic phases that are limited by Pro isomerization. The detailed analysis by various probes indicates that the burial of the N-terminal Trp3, which is associated with the restoration of the active site, occurs in the slow phase, i.e. in the last step of refolding. Evidently, in contrast to the folding of RNase A, there is no catalytically active native-like intermediate in the folding of Onconase.	2007 Nov	Schulenburg Cindy,Martinez-Senac Maria M,Löw Christian,Golbik Ralph,Ulbrich-Hofmann Renate,Arnold Ulrich	The FEBS journal. 274(22) 5826-33	Onconase	QDWLTFQKKHITNTRDVDCDNIMSTNLFHCKDKNTFIYSRPEPVKAICKGIIASKNVLTTSEFYLSDCNVTSRPCKYKLKKSTNKFCVTCENQAPVHFVGVGSC		P22069			5.5	20	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17608622	Evaluation of refolding conditions for a human recombinant fusion cytokine protein, promegapoietin-1a.	Conditions to obtain correctly folded PMP-1a (promegapoietin-1a), an engineered fusion IL-3 (interleukin-3) and thrombopoietin receptor agonist from recombinant Escherichia coli IBs (inclusion bodies), were defined to generate sufficient amounts of protein for evaluation as a potential therapeutic compound. Several ionic and non-ionic detergents, as well as the chaotrope urea, in combination with selected additives, were screened for their ability to dissolve IB protein and promote formation of monomeric, oxidized protein. Upon dissolution, soluble aggregates constituted 50-600f total protein in detergent-solubilized IBs depending on the level of detergent used, whereas use of urea increased aggregation to approx. 70%. Subsequent addition of 5 mM cysteine or DTT (dithiothreitol) reduced the levels of aggregation, but never lower than approx. 20%. Refolds from detergent-solubilized IBs with or without organic modifiers characteristically produced multiple persistent misfolded species. However, the addition of a 12:1 molar excess of cystine (cystine/DTT) to urea-dissolved IBs containing DTT, followed by dilution, promoted the formation of correctly oxidized, disulfide-paired PMP-1a monomer with minimal misfolds present. Thus treatment of urea-dissolved proteins with thiol-group-containing additives and control of dilution, pH, protein concentration and order of addition were able to produce a maximum refold efficiency of 40-500f correctly paired protein monomer.	2008 Jan	Boyle Denis M,Johnson Gary V,Heeren Robert A,Shell Robert E,Banerjee Amit,Gustafson Mark E	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 49(Pt 1) 73-83	Promegapoietin-Ia						7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
18289105	High yield expression of human BACE constructs in Eschericia coli for refolding, purification, and high resolution diffracting crystal forms.	BACE (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme) or beta-secretase, the enzyme responsible for processing APP to give the N-terminal portion of the Abeta peptide, is a membrane bound aspartyl protease consisting of an ectodomain catalytic unit, a C-terminal transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic domain. Three BACE constructs, pET11a-BACE, pQE80L-BACE, and pQE70-BACE were designed to terminate at a position just before the transmembrane domain (Ser(432)) and are described schematically below. (1) pET11a-T7.Tag-G-S-M-(A-8GV......QTDES(432)), (2) pQE80L-Met-R-G-S-(His)(6)-G-S-I-E-T-D-(T(1)QH...QTDES(432)), and (3) pQE70-Met-BACE (R(36)GSFVEMG....PQTDES(432) (His) (6)) Each construct was over-expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. The inclusion body proteins were solubilized in urea and refolded by dilution in water to yield active enzyme. Maximal activity for pET11a-BACE and pQE80L-BACE was usually reached at day 3 to 4, while construct pQE70-BACE required about 21 days. Active BACE was purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography over a column of immobilized peptide inhibitor. The process, easily scalable to 60 liters of cell culture, yielded in excess of 400 mg of active enzyme for crystallographic analysis. Highly purified pET11a-BACE and pQE70-BACE formed complexes with various inhibitors, the latter protein giving crystals diffracting up to 1.45 A resolution. In addition, a crystal form that does not require the presence of an inhibitor has been obtained for pQE70-BACE. This ligand-free crystal form has proven useful for the preparation of BACE-inhibitor complexes in soaking experiments.	2008 	Tomasselli A G,Paddock D J,Emmons T L,Mildner A M,Leone J W,Lull J M,Cialdella J I,Prince D B,Fischer H D,Heinrikson R L,Benson T E	Protein and peptide letters. 15(2) 131-43	Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1	ETDEEPEEPGRRGSFVEMVDNLRGKSGQGYYVEMTVGSPPQTLNILVDTGSSNFAVGAAPHPFLHRYYQRQLSSTYRDLRKGVYVPYTQGKWEGELGTDLVSIPHGPNVTVRANIAAITESDKFFINGSNWEGILGLAYAEIARPDDSLEPFFDSLVKQTHVPNLFSLQLCGAGFPLNQSEVLASVGGSMIIGGIDHSLYTGSLWYTPIRREWYYEVIIVRVEINGQDLKMDCKEYNYDKSIVDSGTTNLRLPKKVFEAAVKSIKAASSTEKFPDGFWLGEQLVCWQAGTTPWNIFPVISLYLMGEVTNQSFRITILPQQYLRPVEDVATSQDDCYKFAISQSSTGTVMGAVIMEGFYVVFDRARKRIGFAVSACHVHDEFRTAAVEGPFVTLDMEDCGYNIPQTDESTLMTIAYVMAAICALFMLPLCLMVCQWRCLRCLRQQHDDFADDISLLK		P56817			9.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18294951	A screening system for the identification of refolding conditions for a model protein kinase, p38alpha.	Protein kinases are key drug targets involved in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes. To aid the development of drugs targeting these kinases, it is necessary to express recombinant protein in large amounts. The expression of these kinases in Escherichia coli often leads to the accumulation of the expressed protein as insoluble inclusion bodies. The refolding of these inclusion bodies could provide a route to soluble protein, but there is little reported success in this area. We set out to develop a system for the screening of refolding conditions for a model protein kinase, p38alpha, and applied this system to denatured p38alpha derived from natively folded and inclusion body protein. Clear differences were observed in the refolding yields obtained, suggesting differences in the folded state of these preparations. Using the screening system, we have established conditions under which soluble, folded p38alpha can be produced from inclusion bodies. We have shown that the refolding yields obtained in this screen are suitable for the economic large-scale production of refolded p38alpha protein kinase.	2008 May	Cowan Richard H,Davies Rick A,Pinheiro Teresa T J	Analytical biochemistry. 376(1) 25-38	Mitogen-activated protein kinase 14 ,p38 alpha	SQERPTFYRQELNKTIWEVPERYQNLSPVGSGAYGSVCAAFDTKTGLRVAVKKLSRPFQSIIHAKRTYRELRLLKHMKHENVIGLLDVFTPARSLEEFNDVYLVTHLMGADLNNIVKCQKLTDDHVQFLIYQILRGLKYIHSADIIHRDLKPSNLAVNEDCELKILDFGLARHTDDEMTGYVATRWYRAPEIMLNWMHYNQTVDIWSVGCIMAELLTGRTLFPGTDHIDQLKLILRLVGTPGAELLKKISSESARNYIQSLTQMPKMNFANVFIGANPLAVDLLEKMLVLDSDKRITAAQALAHAYFAQYHDPDDEPVADPYDQSFESRDLLIDEWKSLTYDEVISFVPPPLDQEEMES		Q16539			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

The oligopeptide-binding protein, OppA, binds and ushers oligopeptide substrates to the membrane-associated oligopeptide permease (Opp), a multi-component ABC-type transporter involved in the uptake of oligopeptides expressed by several bacterial species. In the present study, we report the cloning, purification, refolding and conformational analysis of a recombinant OppA protein derived from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. citri (X. citri), the etiological agent of citrus canker. The oppA gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain under optimized inducing conditions and the recombinant protein remained largely insoluble. Solubilization was achieved following refolding of the denatured protein. Circular dichroism analysis indicated that the recombinant OppA protein preserved conformational features of orthologs expressed by other bacterial species. The refolded recombinant OppA represents a useful tool for structural and functional analyses of the X. citri protein.	2008 	Balan A,Ferreira R C C,Ferreira L C S	Genetics and molecular research : GMR. 7(1) 117-26	Oligopeptide binding protein	MALAVLALAGCRQQPAASAGAAGTAPRQGGTLIYATDREPTCLDPHVQGDMPQVFVARQYLDSLVSMDARGRIGPWLARSWEVSADGTAYTFHLREDVRFSDGTPFTAEALKANLDHIADPHTQSSTAGGYIRQYRRTEIVDTHTAIVHLDSAYAAFLEVMAQGFLGLQSPAALARSREQNCQQPVGSGPFKVERWDRQNQLVLVRNPEYAWAPPTARHNGPAYLDRVVWKFIAEPSVRFASLQAGEVDVIDTLPPEAHAPARINPELSLLVANRPGNPTNGTLNLTRAPFDDIRVREAFLRSADVEGALQSVFFGEFARAGGPLSPGTPFYSADFEHAADYDPARANRLLDQAGWTRRDGAGYRSKNGRRLSVDVLMRSQTWPAEQTLWEQVQATARGTGFEVRLHLLSDALLQQRQAAWDYDVRVGYWNTNTADVLRIIFGSQFLAPVGGKGGFHQNGAGFADAQFDAVVAQALATQDPQQRAQLYHQAQRIASGQFLQLTTYPQSTRLGIYKTAHGVALEPALQVTTLYDAWVSK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8PP32			7.4	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10722756	A critical role for the proteasome activator PA28 in the Hsp90-dependent protein refolding.	The 90-kDa heat shock protein, Hsp90, was previously shown to capture firefly luciferase during thermal inactivation and prevent it from undergoing an irreversible off-pathway aggregation, thereby maintaining it in a folding-competent state. While Hsp90 by itself was not sufficient to refold the denatured luciferase, addition of rabbit reticulocyte lysate remarkably restored the luciferase activity. Here we demonstrate that Hsc70, Hsp40, and the 20 S proteasome activator PA28 are the effective components in reticulocyte lysate. Purified Hsc70, Hsp40, and PA28 were necessary and sufficient to fully reconstitute Hsp90-initiated refolding. Kinetics of substrate binding support the idea that PA28 acts as the molecular link between the Hsp90-dependent capture of unfolded proteins and the Hsc70- and ATP-dependent refolding process.	2000 Mar	Minami Y,Kawasaki H,Minami M,Tanahashi N,Tanaka K,Yahara I	The Journal of biological chemistry. 275(12) 9055-61	Luciferase (Luciferin 4-monooxygenase)	MENMENDENIVYGPEPFYPIEEGSAGAQLRKYMDRYAKLGAIAFTNALTGVDYTYAEYLEKSCCLGEALKNYGLVVDGRIALCSENCEEFFIPVLAGLFIGVGVAPTNEIYTLRELVHSLGISKPTIVFSSKKGLDKVITVQKTVTAIKTIVILDSKVDYRGYQSMDNFIKKNTPQGFKGSSFKTVEVNRKEQVALIMNSSGSTGLPKGVQLTHENAVTRFSHARDPIYGNQVSPGTAILTVVPFHHGFGMFTTLGYLTCGFRIVMLTKFDEETFLKTLQDYKCSSVILVPTLFAILNRSELLDKYDLSNLVEIASGGAPLSKEIGEAVARRFNLPGVRQGYGLTETTSAIIITPEGDDKPGASGKVVPLFKAKVIDLDTKKTLGPNRRGEVCVKGPMLMKGYVDNPEATREIIDEEGWLHTGDIGYYDEEKHFFIVDRLKSLIKYKGYQVPPAELESVLLQHPNIFDAGVAGVPDPIAGELPGAVVVLEKGKSMTEKEVMDYVASQVSNAKRLRGGVRFVDEVPKGLTGKIDGKAIREILKKPVAKM		Q01158			7.2	30	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17823856	L-arginine suppresses aggregation of recombinant growth hormones in refolding process from E. coli inclusion bodies.	L-Arginine was used to suppress the aggregation of recombinant mink and porcine growth hormones in the refolding process from E. coli inclusion bodies by solubilization-dilution protocol at high protein concentration and pH 8.0.

17692532	Expression of a Beauveria bassiana chitinase (Bbchit1) in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris.	Beauveria bassiana chitinase (Bbchit1) is an important cuticle degrading enzyme involved in pathogenesis of fungi against insect. To obtain enough active chitinase for performing in vitro functional analysis, Bbchit1 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, respectively. The high-level production of recombinant Bbchit1 was detected in E. coli expression system, however mainly located in inclusion bodies. Refolding of solubilized inclusion body proteins was achieved by dialysis. In P. pastoris expression system, Bbchit1 was secreted into the culture medium under the induction of methanol. Active Bbchit1 was purified to near 90d0c850urity from culture medium by desalting chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. The yield of Bbchit1 produced by P. pastoris was estimated at 153 mg/L, significantly higher than that of the refolded Bbchit1 from E. coli inclusion bodies (50 mg/L). Additionally, the specific activity of Bbchit1 from P. pastoris was also higher than that from E. coli (3.9 U/mg versus 2.8 U/mg). These results indicated P. pastoris was a convenient expression system for the efficient production of Bbchit1.	2007 Nov	Fan Yanhua,Zhang Yongjun,Yang Xingyong,Pei Xiaoqiong,Guo Shujuan,Pei Yan	Protein expression and purification. 56(1) 93-9	Beauveria bassiana Chitinase	MAPFLQTSLALLPLLASTMVSASPLAPRAGTCATKGRPAGKVLQGYWENWDGAKNGVHPPFGWTPIQNPDIRKHGYNVINAAFPIIQPDGTALWEDGMDTGVKVASPADMCEAKAAGATILMSIGGATAAIDLSSSAVADKFVSTIVPILKKYNFDGIDIDIESGLTGSGNINTLSTSQTNLIRIIDGVLAQMPANFGLTMAPETAYVTGGTITYGSIWGSYLPIIKKYLDNGRLWWLNMQYYNGEMYGCSGDSHKAGTVEGFIAQTDCLNKGLSIQGVTITIPYDKQVPGLPAQPGAGGGHMSPSNVAQVLSHYKGALKGLMTWSLNWDGSKNWTFGDNVKGTLGTA		Q8J1Y3			8.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17703946	Purification and refolding optimization of recombinant bovine enterokinase light chain overexpressed in Escherichia coli.	The nucleotide sequence encoding bovine enterokinase light chain (EK) from Chinese northern yellow bovine was isolated. Two single-nucleotide mutations, namely, C245G and A528T were identified. The gene encoding the Pro82Arg/Glu176Asp variant of known bovine EK was fused with glutathione S-transferase and overexpressed mainly as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), upon induction with IPTG and glucose. Effective fusion protein purification, refolding, auto-catalytic cleavage and mature EK recovery were described. The specific activity of the purified EK was determined as 110+/- 10 U/mg, which was comparable to a specific activity of &gt; or =20 U/mg of the E. coli expressed EK sample provided by Sigma (Cat. No. E4906). This procedure produced approximately 53 mg of EK per 500 mL of cell culture, which was much higher than previous reports, thus providing a basis for large-scale production of EK and for further applications in biotechnology.	2007 Nov	Tan Haidong,Wang Jinxia,Zhao Zongbao Kent	Protein expression and purification. 56(1) 40-7	Enterokinase light chain	IVGGSDSREGAWPWVVALYFDDQQVCGASLVSRDWLVSAAHCVYGRNMEPSKWKAVLGLHMASNLTSPQIETRLIDQIVINPHYNKRRKNNDIAMMHLEMKVNYTDYIQPICLPEENQVFPPGRICSIAGWGALIYQGSTADVLQEADVPLLSNEKCQQQMPEYNITENMVCAGYEAGGVDSCQGDSGGPLMCQENNRWLLAGVTSFGYQCALPNRPGVYARVPRFTEWIQSFLH	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P98072			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
17335058	Specific volume and adiabatic compressibility measurements of native and aggregated recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist: density differences enable pressure-modulated refolding.	High hydrostatic pressures have been used to dissociate non-native protein aggregates and foster refolding to the native conformation. In this study, partial specific volume and adiabatic compressibility measurements were used to examine the volumetric contributions to pressure-modulated refolding. The thermodynamics of pressure-modulated refolding from non-native aggregates of recombinant human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) were determined by partial specific volume and adiabatic compressibility measurements. Aggregates of IL-1ra formed at elevated temperatures (55 degrees C) were found to be less dense than native IL-1ra and refolded at 31 degrees C under 1,500 bar pressure with a yield of 57%. Partial specific adiabatic compressibility measurements suggest that the formation of solvent-free cavities within the interior of IL-1ra aggregates cause the apparent increase in specific volume. Dense, pressure-stable aggregates could be formed at 2,000 bar which could not be refolded with additional high pressure treatment, demonstrating that aggregate formation conditions and structure dictate pressure-modulated refolding yields.	2007 Oct	Seefeldt Matthew B,Crouch Chris,Kendrick Brent,Randolph Theodore W	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 98(2) 476-85	Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein	RPSGRKSSKMQAFRIWDVNQKTFYLRNNQLVAGYLQGPNVNLEEKIDVVPIEPHALFLGIHGGKMCLSCVKSGDETRLQLEAVNITDLSENRKQDKRFAFIRSDSGPTTSFESAACPGWFLCTAMEADQPVSLTNMPDEGVMVTKFYFQEDE		P18510			7	31	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
15388859	High-pressure refolding of bikunin: efficacy and thermodynamics.	Bikunin is a glycosylated protein that aggregates extensively during mammalian cell culture, resulting in loss of activity, loss of native secondary structure, and the formation of nonnative disulfide bonds. We investigated the use of high hydrostatic pressure (1000-3000 bar) for the refolding of bikunin aggregates. The refolding yield obtained with pressure-modulated refolding at 2000 bar was 70 (+/-5%) by reverse-phase chromatography (RP-HPLC), significantly higher than the value of 55 (+/-6%) (RP-HPLC) obtained with traditional guanidine HCl &quot;dilution-refolding.&quot; In addition, we determined the thermodynamics of pressure-modulated refolding. The change in volume for the transition of aggregate to monomer DeltaV(refolding) was calculated to be -28 (+/-5) mL/mole. Refolding was accompanied by a loss of hydrophobic exposure, resulting in a positive contribution to the DeltaV(refolding). These findings suggest that the disruption of electro-static interactions or the differences in size of solvent-free cavities between the aggregate and the monomer are the prevailing contributions to the negative DeltaV(refolding).	2004 Oct	Seefeldt Matthew B,Ouyang Jun,Froland Wayne A,Carpenter John F,Randolph Theodore W	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 13(10) 2639-50	Bikunin Placental	ADRERSIHDFCLVSKVVGRCRASMPRWWYNVTDGSCQLFVYGGCDGNSNNYLTKEECLKKCATVTENATGDLATSRNAADSSVPSAPRRQDSEDHSSDMFNYEEYCTANAVTGPCRASFPRWYFDVERNSCNNFIYGGCRGNKNSYRSEEACMLRCFRQQENPPLPLGSKVVVLAGLFVMVLILFLGASMVYLIRVARRNQERALRTVWSSGDDKEQLVKNTYVL		O43291			8	25	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

12052074	High-pressure refolding of disulfide-cross-linked lysozyme aggregates: thermodynamics and optimization.	Previous exploratory work revealed that high pressure (200 MPa), in combination with oxido-shuffling agents such as glutathione, effectively refolds covalently cross-linked aggregates of lysozyme into catalytically active native molecules, at concentrations up to 2 mg/mL (1). To understand further and optimize this process, in the current study we varied the redox conditions and levels of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) in the refolding buffer. Maximum refolding yields of 80% were seen at 1 M GdnHCl; higher concentrations did not increase refolding yields further. A maximum in refolding yield was observed at redox conditions with a 1:1 ratio of oxidized to reduced glutathione (GSSG:GSH). Yields decreased dramatically at more oxidizing conditions ([GSSG] &gt; [GSH]). Kinetics of dissolution and refolding of covalently cross-linked aggregates of lysozyme depended strongly on redox conditions. At GSSG:GSH ratios of 4:1, 1:1, and 1:16, lysozyme dissolved and refolded with time constants of 62, 20, and 8 h, respectively. Estimates of the free energy of unfolding of lysozyme in GdnHCl solutions at 200 MPa suggested that the native state of lysozyme is strongly favored (ca.18.6 kJ/mol) under the conditions used for dissolution and refolding.

11591710	High pressure refolding of recombinant human growth hormone from insoluble aggregates. Structural transformations, kinetic barriers, and energetics.	Two different types of insoluble, non-native aggregates of recombinant human growth hormone were formed by agitation in buffer or buffer containing 0.75 m guanidine HCl (GdnHCl) and characterized by infrared and second derivative UV spectroscopies. The degree of secondary structural perturbation was greater in the aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl. Both aggregate types were dissolved and refolded using high hydrostatic pressures in combination with either elevated temperature or non-denaturing levels of guanidine HCl or urea. The effects of a range of temperature, pressure, and chaotrope concentrations were tested and led to optimal conditions that approached 100% yield of native protein. The aggregates formed in 0.75 m GdnHCl required higher concentrations of urea or GdnHCl, or higher temperature or pressure for a yield equivalent to that for aggregates formed in buffer alone. Investigation of the effects of pressure, temperature, and chaotrope on unfolding of rhGH documented that under conditions used for optimal high pressure disaggregation and refolding, the native state is greatly favored thermodynamically (e.g. 25 kJ/mol at 2000 bar and 0.75 m GdnHCl). Dissolution of aggregates under pressure is a kinetically limited process. Comparison of refolding yields in GdnHCl and urea solutions suggest that pressure effects on electrostatic interactions do not dominate pressure effects on disaggregation. We suggest that non-native hydrogen bonds between protein molecules within aggregates of recombinant human growth hormone are responsible for the rate-limiting kinetic barrier in pressure-induced disaggregation.	2001 Dec	St John R J,Carpenter J F,Balny C,Randolph T W	The Journal of biological chemistry. 276(50) 46856-63	Growth Hormone	FPTIPLSRLFDNAMLRARRLYQLAYDTYQEFNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNRVKTQQKSNLELLRISLLLIQSWLEPVQLLRSVFANSLVYGASDSNVYRHLKDLEEGIQTLMWRLEDGSPRTGQIFNQSYSKFDTKSHNDDALLKNYGLLYCFRKDMDKVETFLRIVQCRSVEGSCGF		O14643			6	24	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16385003	Effects of solutes on solubilization and refolding of proteins from inclusion bodies with high hydrostatic pressure.	High hydrostatic pressure (HHP)-mediated solubilization and refolding of five inclusion bodies (IBs) produced from bacteria, three gram-negative binding proteins (GNBP1, GNBP2, and GNBP3) from Drosophila, and two phosphatases from human were investigated in combination of a redox-shuffling agent (2 mM DTT and 6 mM GSSG) and various additives. HHP (200 MPa) combined with the redox-shuffling agent resulted in solubilization yields of approximately 42%                                                          from 1 mg/mL of IBs. Addition of urea (1 and 2 M), 2.5 M glycerol, L-arginine (0.5 M), Tween 20 (0.1 mM), or Triton X-100 (0.5 mM) significantly enhanced the solubilization yield for all proteins. However, urea, glycerol, and nonionic surfactants populated more soluble oligomeric species than monomeric species, whereas arginine dominantly induced functional monomeric species (approximately 70%                                                                                                   ) to achieve refolding yields of approximately 55%                                                                              from IBs (1 mg/mL). Our results suggest that the combination of HHP with arginine is most effective in enhancing the refolding yield by preventing aggregation of partially folded intermediates populated during the refolding.

16385003	Effects of solutes on solubilization and refolding of proteins from inclusion bodies with high hydrostatic pressure.	High hydrostatic pressure (HHP)-mediated solubilization and refolding of five inclusion bodies (IBs) produced from bacteria, three gram-negative binding proteins (GNBP1, GNBP2, and GNBP3) from Drosophila, and two phosphatases from human were investigated in combination of a redox-shuffling agent (2 mM DTT and 6 mM GSSG) and various additives.

18313330	A fast and simple method to prepare the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of human target of rapamycin for NMR binding assays.	Mammalian target of rapamycin (TOR) controls cell growth and metabolism in response to the availability of nutrients, growth factors, and the cellular energy status. Misregulation of TOR can result in a pathogenic increase or decrease in organ size and in cancer. TOR can be inhibited by binding of a complex of rapamycin and FKBP to the FKBP-rapamycin binding (FRB) domain. Rapamycin and derivatives of it have been used as immunosuppressive drugs. Because TOR is further an interesting drug target in cancer research, we established an expression, purification, and refolding protocol for the FRB domain of human TOR (hFRB). hFRB is extracted from inclusion bodies, purified by reversed phase HPLC, and refolded by drop-wise dilution of the denatured protein into a native buffer. The procedure is very simple and can easily be scaled up to prepare large amounts of functional protein for high-throughput cancer drug screening assays by NMR and other techniques.	2008 May	Dames Sonja A	Protein expression and purification. 59(1) 31-7	Rapamycin target protein	EELIRVAILWHEMWHEGLEEASRLYFGERNVKGMFEVLEPLHAMMERGPQTLKETSFNQAYGRDLMEAQEWCRKYMKSGNVKDLTQAWDLYYHVFRRI		P42345		FRB domain (2014-2114)	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

16174567	An intrinsic 5&#39;-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase activity in DNA polymerase beta from Leishmania infantum supports a role in DNA repair.	Leishmania infantum is a parasitic protozoan which infects humans. This paper reports the expression in Escherichia coli and purification of the L. infantum gene product (AF182167), as well as its characterization as a DNA polymerase beta (Polbeta)-like, template-dependent DNA repair enzyme, with a metal preference for Mn2+ over Mg2+. As is the case with mammalian Polbeta and DNA polymerase lambda (Pollambda), L. infantum DNA polymerase beta (Li Polbeta) prefers gapped-DNA substrates having a 5&#39;-phosphate end, in agreement with its role in DNA repair reactions. Purified Li Polbeta also displayed a 5&#39;-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (dRP) lyase activity, consistent with a beta-elimination mechanism. The concerted action of dRP lyase and DNA polymerization activities of Li Polbeta on a uracil-containing DNA suggests its participation in &quot;single-nucleotide&quot; base excision repair (BER). Analysis of Li Polbeta DNA polymerization activity at different stages of the L. infantum infective cycle supports a role for Li Polbeta in nuclear DNA repair after the oxidative damage occurring inside the macrophage.	2006 Jan	Alonso Ana,Terrados Gloria,Picher Angel J,Giraldo Rafael,Blanco Luis,Larraga Vicente	DNA repair. 5(1) 89-101	DNA polymerase beta	MLRRKFLRRDHRENIIRIFQEMADLNNALGEKYKVSSYHRSIESLKTNLDKPLNTPQDLKAFSGFGAKLLKKAEEIMATGKLEELESKTKPKLKAIQELTQVHGFGPRAAAALFDREGIFTVDELLQKADSIPSLTDQQRVGIKYFYDINEKIPMQESVLHENYLREKCMEVLGKDFSILICGSYRRRHPFSGDVDAILSRTLDAPPLSEPVAATGVLGHFVEFLESLKYLEATMAQGPLKYMGMGRLPPRIVRDKAGRENTKVYKARRVDIRLIETKSVPTAMLTFTGSKNFNVIMRQAAISKGYLLNEYGLFKLGTPEEARALYERIGIRGKNAGEELGVPKDELEDKRVEVRSEQDVFDVLGMPYAKPENRDP	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9U6N3			6	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10797272	A recombinant cytotoxic chimera based on mammalian deoxyribonuclease-I.	A number of mammalian proteins with suitable biological activities have been considered for use in targeted tumour therapy. Deoxyribonuclease-I (DNase-I), an endonuclease that degrades double-stranded DNA, represents an attractive candidate for tumour targeting since it is normally non-toxic yet could be highly cytotoxic when redirected to the cell nucleus. Our aim was to investigate the cytotoxic potential of mammalian DNase-I and its possible use in tumour-targeting strategies for cancer therapy. A chimeric molecule comprising a scFv reactive against the human placental alkaline phosphatase (hPLAP) and bovine pancreatic DNase-I was designed and investigated. The development of a tightly controlled system for the bacterial expression of DNase-I and its chimera is described. The production and purification of active DNase-I from the soluble cell fraction and significant yields from the insoluble fraction by isolation and refolding are described. The construction, expression, purification and in vitro characterisation of an anti-PLAP scFv-DNase-I chimera is also described. This molecule was shown to possess both antigen-binding and DNA-degrading activity in in vitro assays, thus combining the specific cell-targeting properties of the scFv and the potent, highly catalytic activity of the endonuclease. Furthermore, this chimeric molecule was highly cytotoxic in vitro in cells expressing the PLAP antigen. Targeting mammalian DNase-I provides a novel therapeutic strategy for selective cell killing, with the promise of less systemic toxicity and immunogenicity than currently used immunotoxins.	2000 May	Linardou H,Epenetos A A,Deonarain M P	International journal of cancer.

8390882	Renaturation of casein kinase II from recombinant subunits produced in Escherichia coli: purification and characterization of the reconstituted holoenzyme.	Casein kinase II is a heterotetrameric protein kinase with an alpha 2 beta 2 composition; the subunits can be separated only under harsh denaturing conditions. In this study, the optimal conditions for renaturation of denatured casein kinase II have been established. Purified casein kinase II from rabbit reticulocytes was denatured with 8 M urea and 0.1 M dithiothreitol at 25 degrees C. Various parameters, including arginine, oxidized glutathione/dithiothreitol, substrate, and temperature were optimized for renaturation. Under optimal conditions, the denatured protein kinase was successfully renatured with a recovery of 75% activity and eluted around 160,000 Da upon gel filtration, indicating the tetrameric structure. When the alpha (catalytic) and beta (regulatory) subunits of casein kinase II from Drosophila were cloned and overexpressed with the pET3a vector in Escherichia coli, the majority of the subunits were in an insoluble form. The optimal conditions for denaturation/renaturation of the recombinant casein kinase II from Drosophila were identical to those developed for the holoenzyme, except for the redox state and temperature. When the alpha subunit was solubilized and renatured in an approximate 1:1 ratio with the beta subunit, the catalytic activity was stimulated fourfold over that of the alpha subunit alone. The reconstituted enzyme was purified to apparent homogeneity in one step by chromatography on heparin--TSK. Gel filtration indicated the formation of an alpha 2 beta 2 tetramer. The reconstituted recombinant casein kinase II exhibited characteristics of the native holoenzyme in subunit composition, inhibition by heparin, stimulation by basic compounds, and the KCl concentration required for optimal activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1993 Jun	Lin W J,Traugh J A	Protein expression and purification. 4(3) 256-64	Casein kinase II subunit alpha	TLPSAARVYTDVNAHKPDEYWDYENYVVDWGNQDDYQLVRKLGRGKYSEVFEAINITTTEKCVVKILKPVKKKKIKREIKILENLRGGTNIITLLAVVKDPVSRTPALIFEHVNNTDFKQLYQTLTDYEIRYYLFELLKALDYCHSMGIMHRDVKPHNVMIDHENRKLRLIDWGLAEFYHPGQEYNVRVASRYFKGPELLVDYQMYDYSLDMWSLGCMLASMIFRKEPFFHGHDNYDQLVRIAKVLGTEELYAYLDKYNIDLDPRFHDILQRHSRKRWERFVHSDNQHLVSPEALDFLDKLLRYDHVDRLTAREAMAHPYFLPIVNGQMNPNNQQ		P08181			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
15249047	Expression and characterization of Rv2430c, a novel immunodominant antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.	About 100f the coding sequence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis corresponds to hitherto unknown members of the PE and PPE protein families which display significant sequence and length variation at their C-terminal region. It has been suggested that this could possibly represent a rich source of antigenic variation within the pathogen. We describe the purification and biophysical characterization of the recombinant PPE protein coded by hypothetical ORF Rv2430c, a member of the PPE gene family that was earlier shown to induce a strong B cell response. Expression of the recombinant PPE protein in Escherichia coli led to its localization in inclusion bodies and subsequent refolding using dialysis after its extraction from the same resulted in extensive precipitation. Therefore, an on-column refolding strategy was used, after which the protein was found to be in the soluble form. CD spectrum of the recombinant protein displayed predominantly alpha helical content (81%) which matched significantly with in silico and web-based secondary structure predictions. Furthermore, fluorescence emission spectra revealed that aromatic amino acids are buried inside the protein, which are exposed to aqueous environment under 8M urea. These results, for the first time, provide evidence on the structural features of PPE family protein which, viewed with its reported immunodominant characteristics, have implications for other proteins of the PE/PPE family.	2004 Aug	Choudhary Rakesh K,Pullakhandam Raghu,Ehtesham Nasreen Z,Hasnain Seyed E	Protein expression and purification. 36(2) 249-53	PPE FAMILY PROTEIN	MHFEAYPPEVNSANIYAGPGPDSMLAAARAWRSLDVEMTAVQRSFNRTLLSLMDAWAGPVVMQLMEAAKPFVRWLTDLCVQLSEVERQIHEIVRAYEWAHHDMVPLAQIYNNRAERQILIDNNALGQFTAQIADLDQEYDDFWDEDGEVMRDYRLRVSDALSKLTPWKAPPPIAHSTVLVAPVSPSTASSRTDT		Q79FE1			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
11950969	Steroleosin, a sterol-binding dehydrogenase in seed oil bodies.	Besides abundant oleosin, three minor proteins, Sop 1, 2, and 3, are present in sesame (Sesamum indicum) oil bodies. The gene encoding Sop1, named caleosin for its calcium-binding capacity, has recently been cloned. In this study, Sop2 gene was obtained by immunoscreening, and it was subsequently confirmed by amino acid partial sequencing and immunological recognition of its overexpressed protein in Escherichia coli. Immunological cross recognition implies that Sop2 exists in seed oil bodies of diverse species. Along with oleosin and caleosin genes, Sop2 gene was transcribed in maturing seeds where oil bodies are actively assembled. Sequence analysis reveals that Sop2, tentatively named steroleosin, possesses a hydrophobic anchoring segment preceding a soluble domain homologous to sterol-binding dehydrogenases/reductases involved in signal transduction in diverse organisms. Three-dimensional structure of the soluble domain was predicted via homology modeling. The structure forms a seven-stranded parallel beta-sheet with the active site, S-(12X)-Y-(3X)-K, between an NADPH and a sterol-binding subdomain. Sterol-coupling dehydrogenase activity was demonstrated in the overexpressed soluble domain of steroleosin as well as in purified oil bodies. Southern hybridization suggests that one steroleosin gene and certain homologous genes may be present in the sesame genome. Comparably, eight hypothetical steroleosin-like proteins are present in the Arabidopsis genome with a conserved NADPH-binding subdomain, but a divergent sterol-binding subdomain. It is indicated that steroleosin-like proteins may represent a class of dehydrogenases/reductases that are involved in plant signal transduction regulated by various sterols.	2002 Apr	Lin Li-Jen,Tai Sorgan S K,Peng Chi-Chung,Tzen Jason T C	Plant physiology. 128(4) 1200-11	Steroleosin	MDLIHTFLNLIAPPFTFFFLLFFLPPFQIFKFFLSILGTLFSEDVAGKVVVITGASSGIGESLAYEYAKRGACLVLAARRERSLQEVAERARDLGSPDVVVVRADVSKAEDCRKVVDQTMNRFGRLDHLVNNAGIMSVSMLEEVEDITGYRETMDINFWGYVYMTRFAAPYLRNSRGRIVVLSSSSSWMPTPRMSFYNASKAAISQFFETLRVEFGPDIGITLVTPGFIESELTQGKFYNAGERVIDQDMRDVQVSTTPILRVESAARSIVRSAIRGERYVTEPAWFRVTYWWKLFCPEVMEWVFRLMYLASPGEPEKETFGKKVLDYTGVKSLLYPETVQVPEPKND	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q93W57			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16181698	Mucosal immunization with a ricin toxin B subunit-rotavirus NSP4 fusion protein stimulates a Th1 lymphocyte response.	The castor-oil plant Ricinus communis A-B dimeric toxin B subunit (RTB) was genetically linked at its N-terminus with a 90 amino acid peptide from simian rotavirus SA-11 non-structural protein NSP4(90) and produced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. Biologically active recombinant NSP4(90)-RTB fusion protein was shown to bind glycoprotein asialofetuin receptor molecules in an in vitro enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Oral inoculation of the purified NSP4(90)-RTB ligand-antigen fusion protein delivered the chimeric protein to intestinal epidermal cells for mucosal immunization against rotavirus infection. Mice fed the NSP4(90)-RTB fusion protein generated higher humoral and intestinal antibody titers than mice inoculated with NSP4(90) alone. Titers of serum IgG2a antibodies were significantly higher than IgG1 titers suggesting a dominant Th1 lymphocyte immune response. ELISA measurement of cytokines secreted from splenocyte isolated from immunized mice confirmed NSP4(90)-RTB fusion protein stimulates a strong Th1 cell-mediated immune response. The experimental results demonstrate that the ricin toxin B subunit N-terminus can be used as a site for delivery of virus antigens to the gut associated lymphoid tissues for RTB-mediated immune stimulation of antiviral mucosal immune responses.	2006 Jan	Choi Nak-Won,Estes Mary K,Langridge William H R	Journal of biotechnology. 121(2) 272-83	Non-structural glycoprotein 4	MEKLTDLNYTLSVITLMNNTLHTILEDPGMAYFPYIASVLTGLFALNKASIPTMKIALKTSKCSYKVVKYCIVTIFNTLLKLAGYKEQITTKDEIEKQMDRVVKEMRRQLEMIDKLTTREIEQVELLKRIYDKLTVQTTGEIDMTKEINQKNVRTLEEWESGKNPYEPREVTAAMADVCMDPEPIVRIVGRNGLCVDVRDGRFHNGNAIQLWPCKSNTDANQLWTLKRDNTIRSNGKCLTTYGYSPGVYVMIYDCNTAATDATRWQIWDNGTIINPRSSLVLAATSGNSGTTLTVQTNIYAVSQGWLPTNNTQPFVTTIVGLYGLCLQANSGQVWIEDCSSEKAEQQWALYADGSIRPQQNRDNCLTSDSNIRETVVKILSCGPASSGQRWMFKNDGTILNLYSGLVLDVRASDPSLKQIILYPLHGDPNQIWLPLF	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P04512			8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

16406409	Metal bridges between the PhoQ sensor domain and the membrane regulate transmembrane signaling.	Bacterial histidine kinases respond to environmental stimuli by transducing a signal from an extracytosolic sensor domain to a cytosolic catalytic domain. Among them, PhoQ promotes bacterial virulence and is tightly repressed by the divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. We have determined the crystal structure of the PhoQ sensor domain from Salmonella typhimurium in the Ca2+-bound state, which reveals a highly negatively charged surface that is in close proximity to the inner membrane. This acidic surface binds at least three Ca2+, which mediate the PhoQ-membrane interaction. Mutagenesis analysis indicates that structural integrity at the membrane proximal region of the PhoQ sensor domain promotes metal-mediated repression. We propose that depletion or displacement of divalent cations leads to charge repulsion between PhoQ and the membrane, which initiates transmembrane signaling through a change in orientation between the PhoQ sensor domain and membrane. Therefore, both PhoQ and the membrane are required for extracytosolic sensing and transmembrane signaling.	2006 Mar	Cho Uhn Soo,Bader Martin W,Amaya Maria F,Daley Margaret E,Klevit Rachel E,Miller Samuel I,Xu Wenqing	Journal of molecular biology. 356(5) 1193-206	Virulence sensor histidine kinase phoQ	VGYSVSFDKTTFRLLRGESNLFYTLAKWENNKISVELPENLDMQSPTMTLIYDETGKLLWTQRNIPWLIKSIQPEWLKTNGFHEIETNVDATSTLLSEDHSAQEKLKEVREDDDDAEMTHSVAVNIYPATARMPQLTIVVVDTIPIELKRSYMVWS	N-terminal methionine+C terminal his-tag	P14147		146 periplasmic domain	8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
16185791	Comparative immune responses in Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus after vaccination with viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) recombinant glycoprotein and DNA vaccine using a microarray analysis.	A viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), recombinant glycoprotein vaccine (VHSVg) and a DNA vaccine (pCMV-VHSg) were injected in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Each fish was injected with 10 microg vaccine dissolved in 50 microl phosphate buffer saline (PBS). One month after the vaccination, the fish were challenged intraperitoneally with either 1 x 10(2) or 1 x 10(3) TCID(50) of virus. Fish that received the VHSg DNA vaccine were highly protected against virus infection over a 21-day observation period, with cumulative mortalities ranging from 4 to 10%. However, the recombinant protein vaccine group appeared to have low survival rates. Using microarray analysis, humoral defense-related genes such as complement component C3, complement regulatory plasma proteins, IgM, IgD, MHC class II-associated invariant chain and CD20 receptor were observed to be up-regulated by the VHSg recombinant protein vaccine at 1 or 21 days post vaccination. On the other hand, cellular defense-related genes such as CD8 alpha chain, T-cell immune regulator, MIP1-alpha and apoptosis-associated protein were not detected. Specific antibodies against VHSVg protein were detected in both vaccinated groups at a titer of 1:40 at 28 days post vaccination.	2006 Feb	Byon Ju Yong,Ohira Tsuyoshi,Hirono Ikuo,Aoki Takashi	Vaccine. 24(7) 921-30	Glycoprotein (recombinant glycoprotein vaccine)	MEWNTFFLVILIIIIKSTTPQITQRPPVENISTYHADWDTPLYTHPSNCRDDSFVPIRPAQLRCPHEFEDINKGLVSVPTRIIHLPLSVTSVSAVASGHYLHRVTYRVTCSTSFFGGQTIEKTILEAKLSRQEATDEASKDHEYPFFPEPSCIWMKNNVHKDITHYYKTPKTVSVDLYSRKFLNPDFIEGVCTTSPCQTHWQGVYWVGATPKAHCPTSETLEGHLFTRTHDHRVVKAIVAGHHPWGLTMACTVTFCGTEWIKTDLGDLIQVTGPGGTRKLTPNKCVNTDIQMRGATDDFSYLNHLITNMAQRTECLDAHSDITASGKVSSFLLSKFRPSHPGPGKAHYLLDGQIMRGDCDYEAVVSINYNRAQYKTMNNTWKSWKRVDNNTDGYDGMIFGDKLIIPDIEKYQSVYDSGMLVQRNLVEVPHLSIVFVSNTSDLSTNHIHTNLIPSDWSFNWSLWPSLSGMGVVGGAFLLLVLCCCCKASPPIPNYGIPMQQFSRSQTV	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q77AU2				0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15763465	A novel C-type immulectin-3 from Manduca sexta is translocated from hemolymph into the cytoplasm of hemocytes.	Lectins interact with carbohydrates. They can function as pattern recognition receptors and play an important role in the innate immune system of animals. Previously, we have isolated two calcium-dependent (C-type) lectins, named immulectin-1 and -2, from the tobacco hornworm Manduca sexta. Both immulectin-1 and -2 stimulate prophenoloxidase activation in plasma. Here, we describe isolation and cDNA cloning of a novel member of immulectins, immulectin-3 (IML-3). IML-3, like immulectin-1 and -2, contains tandem carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). The cDNA clone encoding IML-3 is 3802 bp long, with an open reading frame of 930 bp. This cDNA clone has an extremely long noncoding region at the 3&#39; end that contains eight polyadenylation signal sequences. Northern analysis showed that a 5.0 kb IML-3 transcript was present in the fat body of control larvae (injected with saline) but not in the fat body of larvae injected with bacteria. However, a much more abundant 3.1 kb transcript was induced in the fat body of bacteria-injected larvae. IML-3 mRNA was not detected in hemocytes of control or bacteria-injected larvae. Recombinant IML-3 was expressed in bacteria and purified. It specifically bound to immobilized lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid from bacteria, and to laminarin, a beta-1, 3-glucan. Binding of IML-3 to immobilized LPS was competed by excess free LPS. More importantly, IML-3 contains an anti-death-like motif in the carboxyl-terminal CRD. Endogenous IML-3 was detected in the cytoplasm of hemocytes, and FITC-labeled recombinant IML-3 was translocated from hemolymph into hemocytes. Coating of IML-3 onto agarose beads enhanced encapsulation of the beads.	2005 Apr	Yu Xiao-Qiang,Tracy Miles E,Ling Erjun,Scholz Frank R,Trenczek Tina	Insect biochemistry and molecular biology. 35(4) 285-95	Immulectin-3	MEVLRGVVVLITVSIVQGSNVFRADYEYHASAGGWFKFHKVPADWHDARLMCDFEGAVLASPINVDVTDVLQNIINKIEHLSTGVHTGVHNTISPVVFNSIEGVPLSALPVRTRDMFTEEYSSGPHCARLIPQEGLVAGSCSDALPYICYKNKTAELSMTECGTVDKGYQLSAKTGHCYKFHNYGLPWSLAYLRCIAEGGQLAVINSAVEANVLKELLARYPTGLIKGGYAGGAFLGFHDWNNNNVWRTVNGQTLEEAGYANWGVTQPDSSVQNCGQMFRSGQLDDIGCAKVPFICEKHPNNIMPVPNNV		Q5UAW8			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
10209288	Cloning, expression and biochemical characterization of a basic-acidic hybrid phospholipase A2-II from Agkistrodon halys pallas.	A cDNA encoding a basic-acidic hybrid phospholipase A2-II from Agkistrodon halys Pallas with an N-terminus highly homologous to that of BPLA2 and a C-terminus sequence almost the same as that of APLA2 was inserted into a bacterial expression vector and effectively expressed in Escherichia coli RR1. The protein was produced as insoluble inclusion bodies. After partial purification by washing, the inclusion bodies with Triton X-100, denaturing and refolding, the renatured recombinant protein was purified by FPLC column superose 12. The purified recombinant enzyme with an isoelectric point of pH 6.8 could cross-react with antiserum prepared against acidic phospholipase A2. The enzymatic activity of the expressed basic-acidic hybrid phospholipase A2-II is close to that of denatured-refolded native basic phospholipase A2, and has the same inhibiting effect on platelet aggregation as denatured-refolded acidic phospholipase A2, but lacks the hemolytic activity of denatured-refolded basic phospholipase A2. To study the structural relationships among basic phospholipase A2, acidic phospholipase A2 and basic-acidic hybrid phospholipase A2-II, molecular modeling of basic-acidic hybrid phospholipase A2-II was done. The roles of various amino acid residues in the enzymatic activity and pharmacological activities of phospholipase A2 are discussed.	1999 Apr	Liu X,Pan H,Yang G,Wu X,Zhou Y	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1431(1) 157-65	Phospholipase A2 BA2	NLLQFEKMIKKMTGKEPVVSYAFYGCYCGSGGQGKPKDATDRCCFVHDCCYGKVTGCDPKMDVYSFSEENGDIVCGGDDPCKKEICECDRAAAICFRDNLNTYNDKKYWAFGAKNCPQEESEAC		O42190			8.3	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15867859	A hybrid molecule resembling the epitope spectrum of grass pollen for allergy vaccination.	BACKGROUND:Allergy vaccines based on natural allergen extracts contain greatly varying amounts of individual allergens with different immunogenicity.OBJECTIVE:To develop a novel type of allergy vaccine for complex allergen sources that combines defined amounts of the major allergens in the form of single hybrid molecules.METHODS:A hybrid molecule was engineered by PCR-based mending and expression of the cDNAs coding for the 4 major grass pollen allergens and compared with its single components by circular dichroism analysis, T-cell proliferation, ELISA competition, and histamine release assays. Immune responses to the hybrid molecule were studied in BALB/c mice and rat basophil leukemia assays.RESULTS:The hybrid contained most of the B-cell epitopes of grass pollen and could be used to diagnose allergy in 98% (n = 652) of patients allergic to grass pollen. Immunization of mice and rabbits with the hybrid induced stronger and earlier IgG antibody responses than equimolar mixtures of the components, which can be explained by the induction of stronger T-cell responses by the hybrid versus the individual components. IgG antibodies induced by vaccination with the hybrid blocked immediate allergic reactions, as demonstrated by rat basophil degranulation assays in a murine model of grass pollen allergy.CONCLUSION:We demonstrate for grass pollen allergy that recombinant hybrid molecules covering the spectrum of the disease-eliciting epitopes of complex allergen sources can be engineered.	2005 May	Linhart Birgit,Hartl Arnulf,Jahn-Schmid Beatrice,Verdino Petra,Keller Walter,Krauth Maria-Theresa,Valent Peter,Horak Friedrich,Wiedermann Ursula,Thalhamer Josef,Ebner Christof,Kraft Dietrich,Valenta Rudolf	The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology. 115(5) 1010-6	Recombinant grass pollen hybrid molecule	GKATTEEQKLIEDVNASFRAAMATTANVPPADKYKTFEAAFTVSSKRNLADAVSKAPQLVPKLDEVYNAAYNAADHAAPEDKYEAFVLHFSEALRIIAGTPEVHAVKPGAVPKVTFTVEKGSNEKHLAVLVKYEGDTMAEVELREHGSDEWVAMTKGEGGVWTFDSEEPLQGPFNFRFLTEKGMKNVFDDVVPEKYTIGATYAPEEIPAGELQIIDKIDAAFKVAATAAATAPADDKFTVFEAAFNKAIKETTGGAYDTYKCIPSLEAAVKQAYAATVAAAPQVKYAVFEAALTKAITAMSEVQKVSQIPKVPPGPNITATYGDKWLDAKSTWYGKPTGAGPKDNGGACGYKDVDKPPFSGMTGCGNTPIFKSGRGCGSCFEIKCTKPEACSGEPVVVHITDDNEEPIAPYHFDLSGHAFGAMAKKGDEQKLRSAGELELQFRRVKCKYPEGTKVTFHVEKGSNPNYLALLVKYVNGDGDVVAVDIKEKGKDKWIELKESWGAIWRIDTPDKLTGPFTVRYTTEGGTKTEAEDVIPEGWKADTSYESK	4 Pollen allergens UniProtIDs are MPAP1_PHLPR, MPAP2_PHLPR, MPAP6_PHLPR, MPAT5_AMBTR				7.4	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16249186	Structure of the human Papillomavirus E7 oncoprotein and its mechanism for inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor.	The E7 oncoprotein from human Papillomavirus (HPV) mediates cell transformation in part by binding to the human pRb tumor suppressor protein and E2F transcription factors, resulting in the dissociation of pRb from E2F transcription factors and the premature cell progression into the S-phase of the cell cycle. This activity is mediated by the LXCXE motif and the CR3 zinc binding domain of the E7 protein. In this study we report the x-ray crystal structure of the CR3 region of HPV E7 and a structure-based mutational analysis to investigate its mode of pRb and E2F binding and E2F displacement from pRb. The structure reveals a novel zinc-bound E7-CR3 obligate homodimer that contains two surface patches of sequence conservation. Mutation of residues within these patches reveals that one patch is required for pRb binding, whereas the other is required for E2F binding. We also show that both E7-mediated interactions are required to disrupt pRb.E2F complexes. Based on these studies we present a mechanistic model for how E7 displaces E2F from pRb. Because the CR3 region of HPV E7 has no detectable homology to other human proteins, the structure-function studies presented here provide an avenue for developing small molecule compounds that inhibit HPV-E7-mediated cell transformation.	2006 Jan	Liu Xin,Clements Adrienne,Zhao Kehao,Marmorstein Ronen	The Journal of biological chemistry. 281(1) 578-86	Oncoprotein E7	MIGKEVTVQDIILELSEVQPEVLPVDLFCEEELPNEQETEEEPDIERISYKVIAPCGCRHCEVKLRIFVHATEFGIRAFQQLLTGDLQLLCPDCRGNCKHDGS		Q6YNY5			10.15	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16368993	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a cell surface protein involved in fungal adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and interaction with cells.	The pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis causes paracoccidioidomycosis, a pulmonary mycosis acquired by inhalation of fungal airborne propagules, which may disseminate to several organs and tissues, leading to a severe form of the disease. Adhesion to and invasion of host cells are essential steps involved in the infection and dissemination of pathogens. Furthermore, pathogens use their surface molecules to bind to host extracellular matrix components to establish infection. Here, we report the characterization of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) of P. brasiliensis as an adhesin, which can be related to fungus adhesion and invasion. The P. brasiliensis GAPDH was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and polyclonal antibody against this protein was obtained. By immunoelectron microscopy and Western blot analysis, GAPDH was detected in the cytoplasm and the cell wall of the yeast phase of P. brasiliensis. The recombinant GAPDH was found to bind to fibronectin, laminin, and type I collagen in ligand far-Western blot assays. Of special note, the treatment of P. brasiliensis yeast cells with anti-GAPDH polyclonal antibody and the incubation of pneumocytes with the recombinant protein promoted inhibition of adherence and internalization of P. brasiliensis to those in vitro-cultured cells. These observations indicate that the cell wall-associated form of the GAPDH in P. brasiliensis could be involved in mediating binding of fungal cells to fibronectin, type I collagen, and laminin, thus contributing to the adhesion of the microorganism to host tissues and to the dissemination of infection.	2006 Jan	Barbosa Mônica Santiago,Báo Sônia Nair,Andreotti Patrícia Ferrari,de Faria Fabrícia P,Felipe Maria Sueli S,dos Santos Feitosa Luciano,Mendes-Giannini Maria José Soares,Soares Célia Maria de Almeida	Infection and immunity. 74(1) 382-9	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase	MVVKVGINGFGRIGRIVFRNAVEHDDVEIVAVNDPFIETKYAAYMLKYDSTHGQFKGDIQHSSSNNLTVNNKTIHFYQERDPANIPWGKHGVDYVVESTGVFTTTEKAKAHLSGGAKKVIISAPSADAPMFVMGVNEKSYRPDISVLSNASCTTNCLAPLAKVIHDNFGIAEGLMTTIHSYTATQKTVDGPSHKDWRGGRTAAQNIIPSSTGAAKAVGKVIPALNGKLTGMAMRVPTANVSVVDLTCRTEKPVTYDQIKAAVKAASEGELKGILGYSEDALVSTDLNGDPRSSIFDASAGIALNDRFVKLISWYDNEWGYSRRVLDLIAYIAKVDAGK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q6A547			6	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16132855	Signal peptide does not inhibit binding of biotin to streptavidin.	Three recombinant polypeptides of streptavidin: the full-length streptavidin with a signal peptide (rsavS), full-length streptavidin (rsavF) and core streptavidin (rsavC), were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. Although all three recombinant streptavidins had biotin-binding activity, the stability and solubility of rsavC tetraunits were much better than those of rsavS and rsavF, indicating that signal peptide and/or extra amino acid residues in rsavS and rsavF have negative effects on streptavidin. Meanwhile, the signal peptide and extra amino acid residues in rsavS and rsavF made it difficult for polypeptides to fold into functional proteins. After refolding of denaturing-purified proteins in vitro, both the specific activities and biotin binding sites of renatured streptavidins were 1.4-times as that of proteins obtained by native Ni-NTA purification. Because the denaturing-purified rsavC is easy of refolding into functional protein, the better strategy for production of active rsavC is to isolate the protein from IPTG-induced E. coli extracts by denaturing Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by refolding of purified polypeptide in vitro.	2005 Aug	Liu Xipeng,Liu Jianhua	Biotechnology letters. 27(15) 1067-73	Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase	DPSKDSKAQVSAAEAGITGTWYNQLGSTFIVTAGADGALTGTYESAVGNAESRYVLTGRYDSAPATDGSGTALGWTVAWKNNYRNAHSATTWSGQYVGGAEARINTQWLLTSGTTEANAWKSTLVGHDTFTKVKPSAASIDAAKKAGVNNGNPLDAVQQ		P22629			7.4	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8063825	Cloning, expression, and characterization of human apolipoprotein(a) kringle IV37.	A portion of kringle IV37 (KIV37) of apolipoprotein (a), (apo(a)), was polymerase chain reaction-cloned from human liver cDNA. The protein product of this clone was expressed in Escherichia coli as a poly histidine fusion protein. Based on recovery of purified fusion apo(a) KIV37 protein expression levels were estimated to be 10 mg/g of E. coli cell paste. Mass spectral analysis showed the molecular mass of fusion apo(a) KIV37 to be 12,260 +/- 1 daltons. Almost all fusion apo(a) KIV37 was expressed as inclusion bodies and had to be refolded. Fusion apo(a) KIV37 was isolated from the inclusion bodies and purified by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography by eluting with 0.2 M epsilon-aminocaproic acid. The fusion protein was treated with thrombin to yield a homogeneous, functional apo(a) KIV37 domain composed of 92 amino acids having a molecular mass of 10,510 +/- 1 daltons. N-terminal protein sequencing and amino acid analysis have confirmed the sequence and composition of apo(a) KIV37. The molar extinction coefficient, epsilon, for apo(a) KIV37 was determined to be 3.1 x 10(4) M-1 cm-1, and the pI was measured to be 6.7 +/- 0.1. In addition, the dissociation constants, Kd, for a series of 11 lysine analogs have been determined by measuring the change in intrinsic fluorescence of apo(a) KIV37 upon saturable binding with these compounds. Kd values ranged from 4.2 +/- 0.9 microM for trans-4-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid to 4.6 +/- 0.4 mM for L-arginine. Apo(a) KIV37 binds to plasmin-treated fibrinogen with an EC50 value of 14 +/- 1.2 microM and prevents the binding of Lp(a) to plasmin-treated fibrinogen with an IC50 value of 16 +/- 6 microM. Lp(a) binds to the plasmin-treated fibrinogen surface with an EC50 value of approximately 1.0 +/- 0.3 nM. These studies demonstrate that apo(a) KIV37 can be expressed at high levels, refolded properly, and used as a fully functional lysine-binding domain. In addition, these results also demonstrate that apo(a) KIV37 provides the major interaction of Lp(a) with fibrinogen. One additional weak binding site in Lp(a) is adequate to describe overall Lp(a) binding to fibrinogen.	1994 Aug	LoGrasso P V,Cornell-Kennon S,Boettcher B R	The Journal of biological chemistry. 269(34) 21820-7	Apolipoprotein(a)(lipoprotein kringle)	APTEQTPVVRQCYHGNGQSYRGTFSTTVTGRTCQSWSSMTPHRHQRTPENYPNDGLTMNYCRNPDADTGPWCFTMDPSIRWEYCNLTRCSDTEGTVVAPPTVIQVPSLGPPSEQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P08519		apo(a)KIV37 domain composed of 92 amino acid 	8	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10964925	Dm1-MMP, a matrix metalloproteinase from Drosophila with a potential role in extracellular matrix remodeling during neural development.	We have cloned and characterized a cDNA encoding Dm1-MMP, the first matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) identified in Drosophila melanogaster. The isolated cDNA encodes a protein of 541 residues that has a domain organization identical to that of most vertebrate MMPs including a signal sequence, a prodomain with the activation locus, a catalytic domain with a zinc-binding site, and a COOH-terminal hemopexin domain. Northern blot analysis of Dm1-MMP expression in embryonic and larval adult tissues revealed a strong expression level in the developing embryo at 10-22 h, declining thereafter and being undetectable in adults. Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of pro- and active forms of Dm1-MMP in vivo during larval development. In situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that Dm1-MMP is expressed in a segmented pattern in cell clusters at the midline during embryonic stage 12-13, when neurons of the central nervous system start to arise. Recombinant Dm1-MMP produced in Escherichia coli exhibits a potent proteolytic activity against synthetic peptides used for analysis of vertebrate MMPs. This activity is inhibited by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases and by synthetic MMP inhibitors such as BB-94. Furthermore, Dm1-MMP is able to degrade the extracellular matrix and basement membrane proteins fibronectin and type IV collagen. On the basis of these data, together with the predominant expression of Dm1-MMP in embryonic neural cells, we propose that this enzyme may be involved in the extracellular matrix remodeling taking place during the development of the central nervous system in Drosophila.	2000 Nov	Llano E,Pendás A M,Aza-Blanc P,Kornberg T B,López-Otín C	The Journal of biological chemistry. 275(46) 35978-85	Matrix metalloproteinase 1	MTNRRASGATHCKTTNNCNISNNSNKMTNCQSSVFIVVGTLFSILAAAQSAPVSTTTQAEIYLSQFGYLPASARNPASSGLHDQRTWVSAIEEFQSFAGLNITGELDAETMKLMSLPRCGVRDRVGTGDSRSKRYALQGSRWRVKNLTYKISKYPKRLKRVDVDAEIGRAFAVWSEDTDLTFTRKTSGPVHIEIKFVESEHGDGDAFDGQGGTLAHAFFPVFGGDAHFDDAELWTIGSPRGTNLFQVAAHEFGHSLGLSHSDQSSALMAPFYRGFEPVFKLDEDDKAAIQSLYGRKTNQLRPTNVYPATTQRPYSPPKVPLDDSICKDSKVDTLFNSAQGETYAFKGDKYYKLTTDSVEEGYPQLISKGWPGLPGNIDAAFTYKNGKTYFFKGTQYWRYQGRQMDGVYPKEISEGFTGIPDHLDAAMVWGGNGKIYFFKGSKFWRFDPAKRPPVKASYPKPISNWEGVPNNLDAALKYTNGYTYFFKGDKYYRFHDARFAVDSATPPFPRPTAHWWFGCKNTPSSTGNIVEGSDNEFEQHSMIPHADDGNGDDFDAGEWDRLSGSFV	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9GTK3			7.6	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8449924	Sequence and expression of the gene encoding the corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein from Clostridium thermoaceticum and reconstitution of the recombinant protein to full activity.	The corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein (C/Fe-SP) from Clostridium thermoaceticum acts as a methyl group carrier in the anaerobic acetyl-CoA pathway of CO and CO2 fixation. Consisting of a small (approximately 33 kDa) and a large (approximately 55 kDa) subunit, the C/Fe-SP contains 1 mol of cobalt in a corrinoid cofactor and 1 mol of [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster/mol of alpha beta dimer. Cobalt is the site of methylation, and the [4Fe-4S] center appears to serve an electron transfer function. The genes encoding both subunits have been cloned previously and are located within a gene cluster that includes other genes required for CO2 fixation by anaerobic bacteria. When the genes encoding the C/Fe-SP were expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein was found to be inactive. We report the amino acid sequences of the large and small subunits of the C/Fe-SP based on the DNA sequences of the cloned genes. The [4Fe-4S] cluster was found to be located in the large subunit. Although the primary structural lattice for cobamide binding resides in the small subunit, both subunits are required for formation of a stable cobamide-binding protein. Based on sequence comparisons with other [4Fe-4S]-containing proteins, 3 of the 4 cysteine residues that serve as ligands to the iron sites in the cluster have been located. The two subunits were independently overexpressed in E. coli to a level of 30-500f cell protein; however, the resulting protein was inactive, lacked stoichiometric amounts of Fe-S cluster, and lacked cobamide. By combining the recombinant subunits, unfolding them with urea, and refolding in the presence of cobamide, iron, and inorganic sulfide, the resulting C/Fe-SP was found to contain stoichiometric amounts of cobamide and [4Fe-4S] cluster and had spectroscopic and enzymatic properties similar to those of the native protein. We expect that the methods developed here may be used for heterologous overexpression and reconstitution of other complex metalloenzymes. The C/Fe-SP was found to utilize with equal efficiency either vitamin B12 or the natural cofactor 5-methoxybenzimidazolylcobamide as a methyl carrier.	1993 Mar	Lu W P,Schiau I,Cunningham J R,Ragsdale S W	The Journal of biological chemistry. 268(8) 5605-14	Corrinoid/iron-sulfur protein	PLTGLEIYKQLPKKNCGECGTPTCLAFAMNLASGKASLDSCPYVSDAAREALDAAAAPPIAKVVLGAGPTAVEMGDETELFRHDKRFYHETAIAIQVSDNLSSEELKAKVEAINGLNFDRVGQHYTIQAIAIRHDADDPAAFKAAVASVAAATQLNLVLMADDPDVLKEALAGVADRKPLLYAATGANYEAMTALAKENNCPLAVYGNGLEELAELVDKIVALGHKQLVLDPGARETSRAIADFTQIRRLAIKKRFRSFGYPIIALTTAANPLDEVLQAVNYVTKYASLVVLRTDAKEHLLPLLSWRQNLYTDPQVPIRVEEKLNEIGAVNENSPVYVTTNFSLTYYSVEGEIESTKIPSYLLSVDTDGLSVLTAYADGKFEAEKIAAVMKKVDLDNKVKRHRIIIPGAVAVLKGKLEDLTGWEVIVGPREASGIVAFARANLASAVQILRDRSRAAVQKVVLGATKDQGGTRSHTIVVGGDAALPFHHFEGEIVNRPVIGMEVQDIVPDWPDVLKDPFTDVINEPGRWAQKCVAEYGADLIYLKLDGADPEGANHSVDQCVATVKEVLQAVGVPLVVVGCGDVEKDHEVLEAVAEAAAGENLLLGNAEQENYKSLTAACMVHKHNIIARSPLDINICKQLNILINEMNLPLDHIVIDPSIGGLGYGIEYSFSIMERIRLGALQGDKMLSMPVICTVGYEAWRAKEASAPVSEYPGWGKETERGILWEAVTATALLQAGAHILLMRHPEAVARVKENIDQLMVSNAY		Q07340			7	13	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12856308	Trypanosoma brucei: anti-tubulin antibodies specifically inhibit trypanosome growth in culture.	We previously observed that trypanosome tubulin immunizes mice against infection by this parasite. Here we describe the direct effect of anti-tubulin antibodies on trypanosomes, using rabbit antibodies to renatured (nTbTub) or SDS-PAGE denatured (dTbTub) Trypanosoma brucei tubulin. We also evaluate antibodies to synthetic tubulin peptides (STP) and rat brain tubulin (RbTub). The anti-nTbTub serum strongly inhibited trypanosome proliferation in culture, and immunoagglutinated trypanosomes even after heat inactivation of complement. The anti-dTbTub and the anti-STP sera also inhibited trypanosome growth and immunoagglutinated trypanosomes, but to a lesser extent than the anti-nTbTub, whereas the anti-RbTub serum had no effect. In Western blots these antibodies were species specific. Immunofluorescence showed that the surface of intact trypanosomes was not uniformly stained by any of these antibodies, but cells that had been permeabilised were labeled throughout the cytoplasm. This suggests that the variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) played no part in the generation of these inhibitory antibodies.

8139621	Expression of cloned beta-tubulin genes of Haemonchus contortus in Escherichia coli: interaction of recombinant beta-tubulin with native tubulin and mebendazole.	Two distinct beta-tubulin cDNA isotypes (beta 8-9 and beta 12-16) from Haemonchus contortus were expressed for the first time in Escherichia coli and characterised by their specific mebendazole (MBZ) binding and polymerization properties. Beta-tubulin was expressed without translational fusion to an E. coli sequence under the regulation of the tryptophan promoter in the pTrp2 vector. Beta-tubulin was produced in large amounts in insoluble &#39;inclusion bodies&#39;. The inclusion bodies were purified and solubilised and the beta-tubulin renatured by treatment with urea followed by dilution with alkaline buffer and a shift to physiological pH. The yield was more than 10 mg of beta-tubulin per litre of cell culture. The recombinant tubulin produced was recognized in Western blot by specific anti-beta-tubulin antibodies. Tritiated MBZ binding to the recombinant H. contortus beta-tubulin was measured in the presence or absence of whole, tubulin-free or tubulin-rich extracts of H. contortus. Some [3H]MBZ high-affinity binding (HB) to &#39;pure&#39; (no other eukaryotic protein present) beta 8-9 or beta 12-16 was observed. Enhanced high-affinity binding was observed when recombinant beta 8-9 or beta 12-16 were mixed and pre-incubated with whole supernatants or tubulin-enriched extracts from H. contortus. The enhancement was more than additive. Beta 12-16 bound more MBZ and caused a greater enhancement than beta 8-9. Mixing recombinant beta 8-9 or beta 12-16 with whole supernatants or tubulin-enriched fractions from H. contortus promoter polymerization at 37 degrees C. Use of 35S-labelled protein showed that the polymer contained recombinant tubulin. Western blot using specific anti-alpha-tubulin monoclonal antibodies showed that the polymer contained alpha-tubulin. Similarly the recombinant nematode beta-tubulin co-polymerized with tubulin from chicken brain. Our data suggest that the recombinant beta-tubulin can interact and copolymerize with parasite or chicken tubulin. Furthermore the interaction of recombinant nematode beta-tubulin with native tubulin and/or microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) resulted in the formation of high-affinity MBZ-binding sites. However, interaction of recombinant beta-tubulin with microtubule proteins from chicken brain did not result in the formation of high-affinity MBZ-binding sites.	1993 Dec	Lubega G W,Geary T G,Klein R D,Prichard R K	Molecular and biochemical parasitology. 62(2) 281-92	Tubulin beta chain	MREIVHVQAGQCGNQIGAKFWEVISDEHGIQPDGSYKGESDLQLERINVYYNEANGGKYVPRAVLVDLEPGTMDSVRSGPFGALFRPDNFVFGQSGAGNNWAKGHYTEGAELVDSVLDVVRKEAEGCDCLQGFQLTHSLGGGTGSGMGTLLIAKIREEYPDRIMSSFSVVPSPKVSDTVVEPYNATLSVHQLVENTDETFCIDNEALYDICFRTLKLTNPTYGDLNHLVSVTMSGVTTCLRFPGQLNADLRKLAVNMVPFPRLHFFMPGFAPLSAKGAQAYRALTVSELTQQMFDANNMMAACDPRHGRYLTVAAMFRGRMSMREVDDQMMSVQNKNSSYFVEWIPNNVKTAVCDIPPRGLKMAATFVGNSTAIQELFKRISEQFTAMFRRKAFLHWYTGQGMDEMEFTEAESNMNDLVSEYQQYQEATADDEGEMEGAVENDTYAEE		Q25022			10.7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
10103017	Production in Escherichia coli and site-directed mutagenesis of a 9-kDa nonspecific lipid transfer protein from wheat.	The sequence encoding a wheat (Triticum durum) nonspecific lipid transfer protein of 9 kDa (nsLTP1) was inserted into an Escherichia coli expression vector, pET3b. The recombinant protein that was expressed accumulated in insoluble cytoplasmic inclusion bodies and was purified and refolded from them. In comparison with the corresponding protein isolated from wheat kernel, the refolded recombinant protein exhibits a methionine extension at its N-terminus but has the same structure and activity as demonstrated by CD, lipid binding and lipid transfer assays. Using the same expression system, four mutants with H5Q, Y16A, Q45R and Y79A replacements were produced and characterized. No significant changes in structure or activity were found for three of the mutants. By contrast, lipid binding experiments with the Y79A mutant did not show any increase of tyrosine fluorescence as observed with the wild-type nsLTP1. Comparison of the two tyrosine mutants suggested that Tyr79 is the residue involved in this phenomenon and thus is located close to the lipid binding site as expected from three-dimensional structure data.	1999 Mar	Lullien-Pellerin V,Devaux C,Ihorai T,Marion D,Pahin V,Joudrier P,Gautier M F	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 260(3) 861-8	Non-specific lipid-transfer protein	MAARRSGAVVAALMALLVGLAGADFAADRAECADKLMGLATCLTYVQLAATARSPTPDCCSGFRQVLGVSKKCLCVLVKDRDEPTLGIKFNVTRAMNLPSACNIPATFSDCPKILNMSPDSKEAEIFKQYGIEHEGKNATAGGSAAVTGTSGGKSADAAAGAGRHTAVVFAVVVSALLASVLVLA		A0MAU4			7.8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
8886021	Refolding of SDS- and thermally denatured MM-creatine kinase using cyclodextrins.	We have tried to refold thermally-denatured MM-CK using detergent and cyclodextrins as protein folding assistants. This procedure, named artificial chaperone-assisted refolding, has been extensively tested to refold carbonic anhydrase B. Here, we describe a study which shows that this procedure can be applied to refold a dimeric multidomain protein : MM-creatine kinase. The pair SDS/hydroxy-propyl beta-cyclodextrin was used in this sequential refolding method. In the first step, the protein was denatured by SDS which is able to strongly inhibit aggregation. In the second step, hydroxy-propyl beta-cyclodextrin, an efficient SDS-stripping agent, is added and the denatured enzyme can regain its native structure as shown by the 75% reactivation. In conclusion, this study suggests that this procedure can be widely used to refold monomeric, as well as oligomeric, multidomain proteins.	1996 Oct	Couthon F,Clottes E,Vial C	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 227(3) 854-60	Creatine kinase M-type	MPFGNTHNKYKLNYKSEEEYPDLSKHNNHMAKVLTPDLYKKLRDKETPSGFTLDDVIQTGVDNPGHPFIMTVGCVAGDEESYTVFKDLFDPIIQDRHGGFKPTDKHKTDLNHENLKGGDDLDPHYVLSSRVRTGRSIKGYTLPPHCSRGERRAVEKLSVEALNSLTGEFKGKYYPLKSMTEQEQQQLIDDHFLFDKPVSPLLLASGMARDWPDARGIWHNDNKSFLVWVNEEDHLRVISMEKGGNMKEVFRRFCVGLQKIEEIFKKAGHPFMWNEHLGYVLTCPSNLGTGLRGGVHVKLAHLSKHPKFEEILTRLRLQKRGTGGVDTAAVGSVFDISNADRLGSSEVEQVQLVVDGVKLMVEMEKKLEKGQSIDDMIPAQK		P00563			7.4	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
16023306	HIV-1 Rev can specifically interact with MMTV RNA and upregulate gene expression.	We present evidence that the HIV-1 Rev protein can heterologously regulate expression of the simple beta retrovirus mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV). Up to 10-fold upregulation was seen in a functional assay system when specific MMTV sequences were substituted for the HIV-1 Rev responsive element (RRE). RNA gel shift analysis showed that purified recombinant Rev could specifically bind to MMTV unique region 3 prime (U3) RNA and that these sequences could compete for wild-type Rev-RRE binding approximately 20-fold more efficiently than a non-specific competitor RNA. Using a combination of in silico and deletion mutation analyses, it was not possible to define any single specific secondary structure responsive to Rev, suggesting that a structure or combination of structures that only form in the context of the complete U3 transcript is/are required to interact with Rev. Taken together, these results suggest that HIV-1 Rev can directly bind to MMTV RNA as well as mediate upregulation of MMTV gene expression.	2005 Sep	Dangerfield John A,Hohenadl Christine,Egerbacher Monika,Kodajova Petra,Salmons Brian,Günzburg Walter H	Gene. 358 17-30	HIV-1 Rev binding protein-like	MVMAAKKGPGPGGGVSGGKAEAEAASEVWCRRVRELGGCSQAGNRHCFECAQRGVTYVDITVGSFVCTTCSGLLRGLNPPHRVKSISMTTFTEPEVVFLQSRGNEVCRKIWLGLFDARTSLVPDSRDPQKVKEFLQEKYEKKRWYVPPDQVKGPTYTKGSASTPVQGSIPEGKPLRTLLGDPAPSLSVAASTSSQPVSQSHARTSQARSTQPPPHSSVKKASTDLLADIGGDPFAAPQMAPAFAAFPAFGGQTPSQGGFANFDAFSSGPSSSVFGSLPPAGQASFQAQPTPAGSSQGTPFGATPLAPASQPNSLADVGSFLGPGVPAAGVPSSLFGMAGQVPPLQSVTMGGGGGSSTGLAFGAFTNPFTAPAAQSPLPSTNPFQPNGLAPGPGFGMSSAGPGFPQAVPPTGAFASSFPAPLFPPQTPLVQQQNGSSFGDLGSAKLGQRPLSQPAGISTNPFMTGPSSSPFASKPPTTNPFL		A4D2D6				0	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12432567	Optimization of peptide linker length in production of MHC class II/peptide tetrameric complexes increases yield and stability, and allows identification of antigen-specific CD4+T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.	Reliable, efficient systems for producing soluble HLA-DR molecules, suitable for multimerization and use as staining reagents, have proved elusive. We found that the addition of a flexible linker between peptide and N terminus of the DRB1*0101-chain (Crawford, F., Kozono, H., White, J., Marrack, P. and Kappler, J., Immunity 1998. 8: 675-682.), results in greater in vitro folding efficiency of Escherichia coli-expressed alpha- and beta-chains, and increases both the yield and stability of the DRA1*0101/DRB1*0101/peptide complexes. Although a 10-amino acid linker functioned efficiently for a 20mer epitope from HIV p24, a longer linker was required to produce a DR1 MHC class II tetramer with the influenza hemagglutinin epitope (HA(306-318)). The DR1-HA tetramer was able to stain positively over 980f a specific clone (HA 1.7) with only a brief 30-min incubation. The tetrameric complexes detected clone cells diluted into PBMC, with high sensitivity, coupled with low background staining in CD4(+) cells. It was possible to detect antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells within a population of PBMC stimulated with the HA peptide. This demonstrates the potential to monitor CD4(+) T cell responses in peripheral blood in a number of clinical scenarios.	2002 Dec	Cunliffe Sharon L,Wyer Jessica R,Sutton Julian K,Lucas Michaela,Harcourt Gillian,Klenerman Paul,McMichael Andrew J,Kelleher Anthony D	European journal of immunology. 32(12) 3366-75	MHC ClassII HLA-DR-beta	SSPLALAGDTRPRFLEYSTGECYFFNGTERVRFLDRYFHNQEEFVRFDSDVGEYRAVTELGRPDAEYWNSQKDFLEDRRALVDTYCRHNYGVGESFTVQRRVHPKVTVYPSKTQ		Q29769			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15935156	Prolactin in the brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula): development of homologous radioimmunoassay using recombinant possum prolactin.	We report the production of recombinant possum prolactin (posPrl), and its use in the development and validation of a highly specific homologous radioimmunoassay for the measurement of prolactin (Prl) in brushtail possums. This enabled the subsequent investigation of some basic mechanisms involved in the regulation of Prl secretion in this species. Recombinant posPrl spanning the entire coding region was expressed in Escherichia coli, resulting in a 199 amino acid protein with a molecular weight approximately 23 kDa. The potency of posPrl was 45.3 +/- 4.8% that of ovine Prl in a radioreceptor assay using possum mammary gland receptors and induced a 3.4 +/- 0.8-fold increase in progesterone secretion in primary possum granulosa cells. Antiserum (G27) was raised against recombinant posPrl and was highly specific for possum Prl (approximately 300inding at 1:60,000 final dilution), and exhibited negligible cross-reactivity (&lt;0.0001%) with possum growth hormone. Serial dilutions of pituitary gland extracts, and plasma samples from male and female possums gave parallel inhibition curves to recombinant posPrl standards in the assay. Biological validation of the RIA included treating possums with drugs known to alter Prl secretion in other mammals. In seasonally anoestrous female possums, administration of 20 microg thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) resulted in a 15-fold increase (P &lt; 0.01) in plasma Prl concentrations. In mid-late lactating female possums, a bolus of cabergoline (dopamine agonist; 75 microg) reduced (P &lt; 0.05) plasma Prl levels to baseline for 24 h, while repeated administration (6 x 75 microg at 12 h intervals) suppressed (P &lt; 0.01) plasma Prl concentrations until 24h after the last injection. Prolonged inhibition of Prl levels subsequently caused marked (P &lt; 0.01) attenuation in rate of bodyweight increase of pouch young. The amplitude of the Prl surge in response to a bolus of TRH (15 microg) was 5-fold lower in cabergoline-treated, compared to control mid-late lactating possums. In conclusion, we report the development and validation of a robust and sensitive RIA for measuring Prl concentrations in the plasma of brushtail possums.	2005 Jul	Crawford J L,Lun S,Demmer J,Eckery D C	General and comparative endocrinology. 142(3) 297-307	Prolactin	LPICPSGAVNCQVSLSDLFDRAVMLSHYIHSPSSEMFNEFDERYAQGRGFITKAINSCHTSSLSTPEDKEQAQQIHHEDLLNLILRVLRSWNDPLYHLVTEVRSMQEAPDTILSKAMEIEEQNKRLLEGMEKIVGQVHPGDRENEVYSVWSGLPSLQMADEDTRLFAFYNLLHCLRRDSHKIDNYLKLLKCRLIHDSNC		O62781				4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
15939299	Expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant human flotillin-1 in Escherichia coli.	Human flotillin-1 (reggie-2), a major hydrophobic protein of biomembrane microdomain lipid rafts, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli with four different fusion tags (hexahistidine, glutathione S-transferase, NusA, and thioredoxin) to increase the yield. The best expressed flotillin-1 with thioredoxin tag was solubilized from inclusion bodies, first purified by immobilized metal affinity column under denaturing condition and direct refolded on column by decreasing urea gradient method. The thioredoxin tag was cleaved by thrombin, and the flotillin-1 protein was further purified by anion exchanger and gel filtration column. The purified protein was verified by denaturing gel electrophoresis and Western blot. The typical yield was 3.4 mg with purity above 98 0.000000rom 1L culture medium. Using pull-down assay, the interaction of both the recombinant flotillin-1 and the native flotillin-1 from human erythrocyte membranes with c-Cbl-associated protein or neuroglobin was confirmed, which demonstrated that the recombinant proteins were functional active. This is the first report describing expression, purification, and characterization of active recombinant raft specific protein in large quantity and highly purity, which would facilitate further research such as X-ray crystallography.	2005 Jul	Ding Yu,Jiang Ming,Jiang Weihua,Su Yang,Zhou Hanqing,Hu Xiaojian,Zhang Zhihong	Protein expression and purification. 42(1) 137-45	Flotillin-1	MFFTCGPNEAMVVSGFCRSPPVMVAGGRVFVLPCIQQIQRISLNTLTLNVKSEKVYTRHGVPISVTGIAQVKIQGQNKEMLAAACQMFLGKTEAEIAHIALETLEGHQRAIMAHMTVEEIYKDRQKFSEQVFKVASSDLVNMGISVVSYTLKDIHDDQDYLHSLGKARTAQVQKDARIGEAEAKRDAGIREAKAKQEKVSAQYLSEIEMAKAQRDYELKKAAYDIEVNTRRAQADLAYQLQVAKTKQQIEEQRVQVQVVERAQQVAVQEQEIARREKELEARVRKPAEAERYKLERLAEAEKSQLIMQAEAEAASVRMRGEAEAFAIGARARAEAEQMAKKAEAFQLYQEAAQLDMLLEKLPQVAEEISGPLTSANKITLVSSGSGTMGAAKVTGEVLDILTRLPESVERLTGVSISQVNHKPLRTA	N-terminal +C terminal hexahistidine tag + thioredoxin tag	O75955			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16173810	Site-specific PEGylation of engineered cysteine analogues of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.	Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates proliferation of hematopoietic cells of the macrophage and granulocyte lineages and is used clinically to treat neutropenia and other myeloid disorders. Because of its short circulating half-life, GM-CSF is administered to patients by daily injection. We describe here the engineering of highly potent, long-acting human GM-CSF proteins through site-specific modification of GM-CSF cysteine analogues with a cysteine-reactive poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) reagent. Thirteen cysteine analogues of GM-CSF were constructed, primarily in nonhelical regions of the protein believed to lie away from the major receptor binding sites. The GM-CSF cysteine analogues were properly processed but insoluble following secretion into the Escherichia coli periplasm. The proteins were refolded and purified by column chromatography. Ten of the cysteine analogues could be modified with a 5-kDa maleimide PEG, and seven of the mono-PEGylated proteins were purified by ion-exchange column chromatography. Biological activities of the 13 cysteine analogues and 7 PEGylated cysteine analogues were comparable to that of wild-type GM-CSF in an in vitro cell proliferation assay using human TF-1 cells. One cysteine analogue was modified with larger 10-, 20-, and 40-kDa PEGs, with only minimal loss of in vitro bioactivity. Pharmacokinetic experiments in rats demonstrated that the PEGylated proteins had up to 47-fold longer circulating half-lives than wild-type GM-CSF. These data demonstrate the utility of site-specific PEGylation for creating highly potent, long-acting GM-CSF analogues and provide further evidence that the nonhelical regions of human GM-CSF examined are largely nonessential for biological activity of the protein.

7814368	Expression and folding of recombinant bovine prethrombin-2 and its activation to thrombin.	Bovine prethrombin-2 has been produced in Escherichia coli using a T7 expression system. The expressed prethrombin-2 formed intracellular inclusion bodies which were solubilized by reversible sulfonation of the cysteines in the presence of 7 M guanidine hydrochloride. Sulfonated prethrombin-2 was refolded in the presence of 4 M guanidine hydrochloride, using oxidized and reduced glutathione as the redox couple. The folded protein was purified by heparin affinity chromatography and activated to thrombin with Echis carinatus snake venom. The resulting thrombin was also purified by heparin affinity chromatography. Kinetic constants were determined for the hydrolysis of H-D-phenylalanyl-L-pipecolyl-L-arginine-p-nitroaniline by recombinant thrombin (kcat = 123 +/- 10 s-1 and Km = 2.91 +/- 0.3 microM). These values are in good agreement with those determined for wild-type thrombin (kcat = 97 +/- 8 s-1 and Km = 2.71 +- 0.25 microM). From the thrombin-mediated release of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen, kcat/Km was found to be the same for recombinant (17.3 +/- 1.2 microM-1 s-1) and wild-type (16.7 +/- 2.0 microM-1 s-1) thrombin. These results, taken together with circular dichroism spectra and the elution position of prethrombin-2 from a heparin affinity resin, indicate that prethrombin-2 was folded into a conformation similar to that of the wild-type protein. In addition, since E. coli produces deglycosylated enzymes, these findings suggest that the carbohydrate on the B chain of wild-type thrombin does not affect the amidolytic and fibrinolytic activities of thrombin. Finally, this expression system can be used to prepare mutants of prethrombin-2 for future structure-function studies involving thrombin and its substrates; some preliminary results of this type are presented here.	1995 Jan	DiBella E E,Maurer M C,Scheraga H A	The Journal of biological chemistry. 270(1) 163-9	Prothrombin	SGGSTTSQSPLLETCVPDRGREYRGRLAVTTSGSRCLAWSSEQAKALSKDQDFNPAVPLAENFCRNPDGDEEGAWCYVADQPGDFEYCDLNYCEEPVDGDLGDRLGEDPDPDAAIEGRTSEDHFQPFFNEKTFGAGEADCGLRPLFEKKQVQDQTEKELFESYIEGRIVEGQDAEVGLSPWQVMLFRKSPQELLCGASLISDRWVLTAAHCLLYPPWDKNFTVDDLLVRIGKHSRTRYERKVEKISMLDKIYIHPRYNWKENLDRDIALLKLKRPIELSDYIHPVCLPDKQTAAKLLHAGFKGRVTGWGNRRETWTTSVAEVQPSVLQVVNLPLVERPVCKASTRIRITDNMFCAGYKPGEGKRGDACEGDSGGPFVMKSPYNNRWYQMGIVSWGEGCDRDGKYGFYTHVFRLKKWIQKVIDRLGS		P00735			7.4	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15464607	Refolding kinetics of denatured-reduced lysozyme in the presence of folding aids.	The refolding kinetic behavior of denatured-reduced lysozyme in the presence of folding aids (acetamide, acetone, thiourea, L-arginine or glycerol) was studied utilizing a simplified model describing the competition between first-order folding reaction and third-order aggregation. It was found that the protein folding aids could be categorized into two groups. One of them at proper concentrations, such as acetamide, acetone, thiourea and L-arginine, stabilized unfolded protein or folding intermediates. In the presence of these additives, the folding rate decreased with increasing their concentration, and there existed a concentration where the aggregation rate constant was minimized. So, there was an optimum concentration for the folding aids to produce a high yield. The other group was protein stabilizers such as glycerol. In the presence of this kind of folding aids, both the refolding rate and yield were enhanced by increasing their concentration to a proper value. Moreover, their effect on improving protein refolding was additive to those of the first group. So the cooperative application of the two kinds of folding aids could result in favorable refolding rate and yield of protein.	2004 Oct	Dong Xiao-Yan,Huang Yan,Sun Yan	Journal of biotechnology. 114(1-2) 135-42	Lysozyme	KVFGRCELAAAMKRHGLDNYRGYSLGNWVCAAKFESNFNTQATNRNTDGSTDYGILQINSRWWCNDGRTPGSRNLCNIPCSALLSSDITASVNCAKKIVSDGNGMNAWVAWRNRCKGTDVQAWIRGCRL		P00698			8.5	37	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2229053	Refolding of an integral membrane protein. OmpA of Escherichia coli.	OmpA is an integral membrane protein from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli. Purified, lipopolysaccharide-free OmpA was denatured by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Refolding was then induced by replacement of SDS with the nonionic detergent octylglucoside. The structure of both the denatured and refolded protein were investigated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, protease digestion, Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. Refolded OmpA could be reconstituted into membranes of the synthetic lipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. Thus, lipopolysaccharide is neither necessary for proper folding of OmpA nor for its insertion into lipid membranes. Based on this result, models for sorting of OmpA into the outer membrane of E. coli are discussed.	1990 Nov	Dornmair K,Kiefer H,Jähnig F	The Journal of biological chemistry. 265(31) 18907-11	Outer membrane protein A	APKDNTWYTGAKLGWSQYHDTGFINNNGPTHENQLGAGAFGGYQVNPYVGFEMGYDWLGRMPYKGSVENGAYKAQGVQLTAKLGYPITDDLDIYTRLGGMVWRADTKSNVYGKNHDTGVSPVFAGGVEYAITPEIATRLEYQWTNNIGDAHTIGTRPDNGMLSLGVSYRFGQGEAAPVVAPAPAPAPEVQTKHFTLKSDVLFNFNKATLKPEGQAALDQLYSQLSNLDPKDGSVVVLGYTDRIGSDAYNQGLSERRAQSVVDYLISKGIPADKISARGMGESNPVTGNTCDNVKQRAALIDCLAPDRRVEIEVKGIKDVVTQPQA		P0A911			7.5	25	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16394506	Harvest active recombinant Rho kinase from Escherichia coli.	Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitors are effective candidates for treating nerve or myocardial injury, erectile dysfunction, and other cardiovascular diseases. Purified ROCK is a foundation for ROCK inhibitors screening and for its function research in vitro. This article established an easy way to harvest active recombinant ROCK catalytic domain (ROCK-CD) of rat in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The cDNA of ROCK-CD was amplified by RT-PCR, and subcloned to pET28a(+) vector to express the protein in E. coli BL(21) as inclusion bodies. The protein was purified by HiTrap chelating column, and its refolding was achieved by gradient dilution from guanidine hydrochloride solution, and desalinated by ultrafiltration. The result of DNA sequencing and protein sequence analysis indicate there were three amino acid residua of mutation, but the activity was not significantly affected. The activity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by ROCK II activity fluorescence polarization kit. Therefore, this is an easy and rapid procedure to harvest a large quantity of activity recombinant ROCK-CD at low cost.	2006 Jan	Duan Weigang,Wang Shanzhi,Chen Min,Wang Cuifen,Zhang Luyong,Liu Jun,Sun Lixin,Yan Ming	Biological &amp; pharmaceutical bulletin. 29(1) 38-42	Rho-associated protein kinase 2	PEAAAGDGAGAGRQRKLEALIRDPRSPINVESLLDGLNSLVLDLDFPALRKNKNIDNFLNRYEKIVKKIRGLQMKAEDYDVVKVIGRGAFGEVQLVRHKASQKVYAMKLLSKFEMIKRSDSAFFWEERDIMAFANSPWVVQLFCAFQDDRYLYMVMEYMPGGDLVNLMSNYDVPEKWAKFYTAEVVLALDAIHSMGLIHRDVKPDNMLLDKHGHLKLADFGTCMKMDETGMVHCDTAVGTPDYISPEVLKSQGGDGYYGRECDWWSVGVFLFEMLVGDTPFYADSLVGTYSKIMDHKNSLCFPEDTEISKHAKNLICAFLTDREVRLGRNGVEEIKSASFFKNDQWNWDNIRETAAPVVPELSSDIDSSNFDDIEDDKGDVETFPIPKAFVGNQLPFIGFTYFRENLLLSDSPPCRENDAIQTRKSEESQEIQKKLYALEEHLSSEVQAKEELEQKCKSINTRLEKTAKELEEEITFRKNVESTLRQLEREKALLQHKNAEYQRKADHEADKKRNLENDVNSLKDQLEDLKKRNQSSQISTEKVNQLQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q62868		Catalytic domain of ROCK		25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16113314	Merozoite surface protein 1 of Plasmodium vivax induces a protective response against Plasmodium cynomolgi challenge in rhesus monkeys.	The 42-kDa fragment of the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1(42)) is a leading candidate for the development of a vaccine to control malaria. We previously reported a method for the production of Plasmodium vivax MSP-1(42) (PvMSP-1(42)) as a soluble protein (S. Dutta, L. W. Ware, A. Barbosa, C. F. Ockenhouse, and D. E. Lanar, Infect. Immun. 69:5464-5470, 2001). We report here a process to manufacture the same PvMSP-1(42) protein but as an insoluble inclusion body-derived protein which was then refolded in vitro. We compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the soluble and refolded forms of PvMSP-1(42) protein by using a heterologous but closely related P. cynomolgi-rhesus monkey challenge model. As comparative controls we also expressed, purified, and immunized rhesus with the soluble and refolded forms of the P. cynomolgi MSP-1(42) (PcMSP-1(42)) proteins. All proteins induced equally high-titer, cross-reacting antibodies. Upon challenge with P. cynomolgi, none of the MSP-1(42)-vaccinated groups demonstrated sterile protection or a delay in the prepatent period. However, following an initial rise in parasitemia, all MSP-1-vaccinated animals had significantly lower parasite burdens as indicated by lower cumulative parasitemia, lower peak parasitemia, lower secondary peak parasitemia, and lower average daily parasitemia compared to the adjuvant control group (P &lt; 0.05). Except the soluble PcMSP-1(42) group, monkeys in all other groups had fewer numbers of days with parasitemia of &gt;10,000 parasites mm(-3). Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the level of partial protection observed in the homologous and heterologous groups in this challenge model. The soluble and refolded forms of PcMSP-1(42) and PvMSP-1(42) proteins also appeared to have a similar partially protective effect.	2005 Sep	Dutta Sheetij,Kaushal Deep C,Ware Lisa A,Puri Sunil K,Kaushal Nuzhat A,Narula Atul,Upadhyaya D S,Lanar David E	Infection and immunity. 73(9) 5936-44	Merozoite Surface Protein-1	MKALLFLFSFIFFVTKCQCETESYKQLVAKLDKLEALVVDGYELFHKKKLGESDIQVETNASANNNNNNQVSVLTSKIRNFVGKFLELQIPGHTDLLHLIRELAFEPNGIKYLVESYEEFNQLMHVINFHYDLLRAKLHDMCAHDYCKIPEHLKITEKELDMLKKVVLGYRKPLDNIKDDIGKLEAFITKNKNTIKKISDLITEEHKKRSGQYTSTISGNGAQTDGHQPTTASSETSSGSSVSSVSGSSGLGSSGTGSTGTGSTGNISPSQARADSPSTGTDYNAKKIIFQAVYNTIFYTNQLQEAQKLIAVLEKRVKVLKEHKDIKVLLEQVAKEKEKLPKDNTTTTNLTNVHKEAESKIAELEKKIEAIAKTVNFDLDGLFTDAEELEYYLREKAKMAGTLIIPESTKSAGTPGKTVPTLKETYPHGISYALAENSIYELIEKIGSDETFGDLQNPDDGKQPKKGILINETKRKELLEKIMNKIKIEEDKLPNLKKEYDEKFKVYEEKVKDFQPAFNHFYEARLDNTLVENKFDEFKTKREAYMEEKKKLESCSYEQNTNLINKLKKQLTYLEDYVLRKDIADDEIKHFSFMEWKLKSEIYDLAQEIRKNENKLTVENKFDFSGVVELQVQKVLIIKKIEALKNVQNLLKNAKVKDDLYVPKVYKTGEKPEPYYLMVLKREIDKLKDFIPKIESMIATEKNKPTVAAADIVAKGQSLRGASETGTTGNTVNAQTAVVQPPQYQVVNAVTVQPGTTGHQAQGGEAETQTNSVQAAQVQQTPAGAGGQVASTQTTSQAPAPTQASPEPAPAAPPSTPAAAVAPAPTMSKLEYLQKLLDFLKSAYACHKHIFVTNSTMDKKLLKEYELNADEQNKIKENKCDELDLLFNVQNNLPAMYSIYDSMSNELQNLYIELYQKEMVYNIYKNKDTDKKIKAFLETSNNKAAAPAQSAAKPSGQAGTTPVTTTVPVTTTTVTPSPQTSVVTSTPPTPQAEENQRVGGNSEEKPEADTAQVEKFYEKHSQIDKYNDYFKKFLESKKEEIIKMDDTKWNALGKEIEELKKKLQVSLDHYGKYKLKLERFLKKKNKISNSKDQIKKLTSLKNKLERRQNLLNNPTSVLKNYTAFFNKKRETEKKEVENTLKNTEILLKYYKARAKYYIGEPFPLKTLSEESMQKEDNYLNLEKFRVLSRLEGRLGKNIELEKENISYLSSGLLHVLTELKEIINDKKYSGKDHAKNIAEVKKALQAYQELIPKVTSQESTSVAVTVPGAVVPGVPTAAAAGSGASGAVPPAGGPSPPATGGVVPGVVESAEAQTQTQAQDYAEDYDKVIALPLFGNNDDDGEEDQVTTGEAESEAPEILVPAGISDYDVVYLKPLAGMYKTIKKQLENHVNAFNTNITDMLDSRLKKRNYFLEVLNSDLNPFKYSSSGEYIIKDPYKLLDLEKKKKLIGSYKYIGASIDMDLATANDGVAYYNKMEELYKTHLTAVNAQIKKVEDDINTQNEELKKIENEANKTAEKAKFTAKKAELEKYLPFLNSLQKEYESLVSKVNTYTDNLKKVINNCQLEKKEAEITVKKLQDYNKMDEKLEEYKKSEKKNEVKSSGLLEKLMKSKLIKENESKEILSQLLNVQTQLLTMSSEHTCIDTNVPDNAACYRYLDGTEEWRCLLTFKEEGGKCVPASNVTCKDNNGGCAPEAECKMTDSNKIVCKCTKEGSEPLFEGVFCSSSSFLSLSFLLLMLLFLLCMEL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q2I7F0			8	22	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
11876638	The two-domain NK1 fragment of plasminogen: folding, ligand binding, and thermal stability profile.	The two-domain fragment N+K1 (rNK1) [Glu(1)-Glu(163)] of human plasminogen was expressed in E. coli as a hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein and chromatographically purified. The (1)H NMR spectrum supports proper folding of the K1 component within the refolded rNK1 construct (rNK1/K1). The functional properties of rNK1/K1 were investigated via intrinsic fluorescence titration with kringle-specific omega-aminocarboxylic acid ligands. The affinities closely match those previously measured for the isolated K1, which indicates that the N-domain does not significantly affect the interaction of ligands with the lysine binding site of K1. Far-UV CD spectra recorded for the N-domain suggest conformational plasticity and flexibility for the module. Two classes of spectra, referred to as types A and B, were identified with the type A spectrum reflecting a higher secondary structure content than that estimated for the type B spectrum. Subtracting the CD spectrum of rK1 from that of rNK1 yields a spectrum (Delta) which reflects the conformation of the N-domain within the rNK1 construct (rNK1/N). Delta resembles the type A spectrum, suggesting that rNK1/N adopts a relatively more ordered conformation, stabilized by the adjacent rNK1/K1 domain. In contrast, thermal unfolding curves determined via CD indicate that the rNK1/N slightly lowers the melting temperature (T(m)) of rNK1/K1. Independence of the two domains within rNK1 was tested by monitoring the thermal unfolding of rNK1/K1 when in the presence of the kringle-specific ligand AMCHA, which left the rNK1/N T(m) essentially unaffected, while increasing that of the rNK1/K1 by approximately 10 degrees C.	2002 Mar	Douglas Justin T,von Haller Priska D,Gehrmann Marion,Llinás Miguel,Schaller Johann	Biochemistry. 41(10) 3302-10	Serpin A5 (also known as Protein Inhibitor 3, Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 3)	MQLFLLLCLVLLSPQGASLHRHHPREMKKRVEDLHVGATVAPSSRRDFTFDLYRALASAAPSQNIFFSPVSISMSLA		P05154		Recombinant N-terminal domain+kringle 1	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
12538548	Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.	No single noninvasive test for pulmonary embolism is both sensitive and specific. Some tests are good for &quot;ruling in&quot; pulmonary embolism (e.g., helical CT) and some tests are good for &quot;ruling out&quot; pulmonary embolism (e.g., D-dimer); others are able to do both but are often nondiagnostic (e.g., ventilation-perfusion lung scanning). For optimal efficiency, choice of the initial diagnostic test should be guided by clinical assessment of the probability of pulmonary embolism and by patient characteristics that may influence test accuracy. This selective approach to testing enables pulmonary embolism to be diagnosed or excluded in a minimum number of steps. However, even with the appropriate use of combinations of noninvasive tests, it is often not possible to definitively diagnose or exclude pulmonary embolism at initial presentation. Most of these patients can be managed safely without treatment or pulmonary angiography by repeating ultrasound testing of the proximal veins after one and 2 weeks to detect evolving deep vein thrombosis. Helical CT and MRI are rapidly improving as diagnostic tests for pulmonary embolism and are expected to become central to its evaluation.	2003 Jan	Kearon Clive	CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l&#39;Association medicale canadienne. 168(2) 183-94	Triosephosphate isomerase	MGRTFFVGGNWKCNGTSEEIKKIVATLNAGQVPSQDVVEVVVSPPYVFLPLVKNELRSDFHVAAQNCWVKKGGAFTGEVSADMLVNLGIPWVILGHSERRAILGESNEFVGDKVAYALSQGLRVIACVGETLEQRESGSTMDVVAAQTKAIAERVKDWSNVVVAYEPVWAIGTGKVATPAQAQEVHAELRKWLQANVSAEVAASTRIIYGGSVSGANCKELAGQPDVDGFLVGGASLKPEFIDIIKAAEVKKGA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q6T379			5.9	0	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
10406951	Refolding of recombinant alpha and beta subunits of the Rhodospirillum rubrum F(0)F(1) ATP synthase into functional monomers that reconstitute an active alpha(1)beta(1)-dimer.	The alpha subunit from the Rhodospirillum rubrum F(0)F(1) ATP synthase (RrF(1)alpha) was over-expressed in unc operon-deleted Escherichia coli strains under various growth conditions only in insoluble inclusion bodies. The functional refolding of urea-solubilized RrF(1)alpha was followed by measuring its ability to stimulate the restoration of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis in beta-less R. rubrum chromatophores reconstituted with pure native or recombinant RrF(1)beta [Nathanson, L. &amp; Gromet-Elhanan, Z. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 10933-10938]. The refolding efficiency was found to increase with decreasing RrF(1)alpha concentrations and required high concentrations of MgATP, saturating approximately 60% when 50 microgram protein.mL(-1) were refolded in presence of 50 mM MgATP. Size-exclusion HPLC of such refolded RrF(1)alpha revealed a 50-60 0ecrease in its aggregated form and a parallel appearance of its monomeric peak. RrF(1)beta refolded under identical conditions appeared almost exclusively as a monomer. This procedure enabled the isolation of large amounts of a stable RrF(1)alpha monomer, which stimulated the restoration of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis much more efficiently than the refolded alpha mixture, and bound ATP and ADP in a Mg-dependent manner. Incubation of both RrF(1)alpha and beta monomers, which by themselves had no ATPase activity, resulted in a parallel appearance of activity and assembled alpha(1)beta(1)-dimers, but showed no formation of alpha(3)beta(3)-hexamers. The RrF(1)-alpha(1)beta(1)-ATPase activity was, however, very similar to the activity observed in isolated native chloroplast CF(1)-alpha(3)beta(3), indicating that these dimers contain only the catalytic nucleotide-binding site at their alpha/beta interface. Their inability to associate into an alpha(3)beta(3)-hexamer seems therefore to reflect a much lower stability of the noncatalytic RrF(1) alpha/beta interface.	1999 Jul	Du Z,Gromet-Elhanan Z	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 263(2) 430-7	ATP synthase subunit alpha	MEIRAAEISAILKEQIANFGTEAESAEVGQVLSVGDGIARVYGLDNVQAGEMVEFANGVKGMALNLESDNVGIVIFGEDRGIKEGDVVKRTQTIVDVPVGKGLLGRVVDGLGNPIDGKGDLVDVERKRAEVKAPGIIPRKSVHEPVQTGIKAIDSLIPIGRGQRELIIGDRQTGKTAVILDTILNQKAVNDKAKDDSEKLFCVYVAVGQKRSTVAQVVKVLADHGALDYTIVVAATASEPAPLQFLAPYTGCTMGEFFRDNGMHAVIFYDDLTKQAVAYRQMSLLLRRPPGREAFPGDVFYLHSRLLERAAKLNDDNGAGSLTALPVIETQANDVSAYIPTNVISITDGQIFLETDLFFKGIRPAVNVGLSVSRVGSSAQIKAMKQVAGSIKLELAQYREMAAFAQFASDLDPATQKLLARGARLTELLKQAQYSPLAVEEQVCVIYAGTRGYLDKLKTTDVVRYEASLLGALRTSGADLLESIRTGKALSKEIEQKLVKFLDDFGKKFA		P05036			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12011004	Purification, characterization, and immunogenicity of the refolded ectodomain of the Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1 expressed in Escherichia coli.	The apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) has emerged as a promising vaccine candidate against malaria. Advanced evaluation of its protective efficacy in humans requires the production of highly purified and correctly folded protein. We describe here a process for the expression, fermentation, refolding, and purification of the recombinant ectodomain of AMA1 (amino acids 83(Gly) to 531(Glu)) of Plasmodium falciparum (3D7) produced in Escherichia coli. A synthetic gene containing an E. coli codon bias was cloned into a modified pET32 plasmid, and the recombinant protein was produced by using a redox-modified E. coli strain, Origami (DE3). A purification process was developed that included Sarkosyl extraction followed by affinity purification on a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The recombinant AMA1 was refolded in the presence of reduced and oxidized glutathione and further purified by using two ion-exchange chromatographic steps. The final product, designated AMA1/E, was homogeneous, monomeric, and &gt;99d0c850ure and had low endotoxin content and low host cell contamination. Analysis of AMA1/E showed that it had the predicted primary sequence, and tertiary structure analysis confirmed its compact disulfide-bonded nature. Rabbit antibodies made to the protein recognized the native parasite AMA1 and inhibited the growth of the P. falciparum homologous 3D7 clone in an in vitro assay. Reduction-sensitive epitopes on AMA1/E were shown to be necessary for the production of inhibitory anti-AMA1 antibodies. AMA1/E was recognized by a conformation-dependent, growth-inhibitory monoclonal antibody, 4G2dc1. The process described here was successfully scaled up to produce AMA1/E protein under GMP conditions, and the product was found to induce highly inhibitory antibodies in rabbits.	2002 Jun	Dutta Sheetij,Lalitha P V,Ware Lisa A,Barbosa Arnoldo,Moch J Kathleen,Vassell Meredith A,Fileta Bader B,Kitov Svetlana,Kolodny Nelly,Heppner D Gray,Haynes J David,Lanar David E	Infection and immunity. 70(6) 3101-10	Apical membrane antigen 1	GAEPAPQEQNLFSSIEIVERSNYMGNPWTEYMAKYDIKEVHGSGIRVDLGEDAEVAGTQYRLPSGKCPVFGKGIIIENSNTTFLKPVATGNQDLKDGGFAFPPTNPLISPMTLDHMRDFYKNNEYVKNLDELTLCSRHAGNMNPDNDKNSNYKYPAVYDYNDKKCHILYIAAQENNGPRYCNKDESKRNSMFCFRPAKDKSFQNYTYLSKNVVDNWEKVCPRKNLENAKFGLWVDGNCEDIPHVNEFSANDLFECNKLVFELSASDQPKQYEQHLTDYEKIKEGFKNKNASMIKSAFLPTGAFKADRYKSRGKGYNWGNYNRKTQKCEIFNVKPTCLINNSSYIATTALSHPNEVEHNFPCSLYKDEIKKEIERESKRIKLNDNDDEGNKKIIAPRIFISDDIDSLKCPCDPEIVSNSTCNFFVCKCVEKRAEVTSNNEVVVKEEYKDE	N-terminal +C terminal hexahistidine tag + thioredoxin tag	P50492		3D7(residues 83-531)	8	22	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11717506	Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of glucose dehydrogenase from Haloferax mediterranei.	Glucose dehydrogenase (E.C. 1.1.1.47; GlcDH) from Haloferax mediterranei has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli, solubilized by the addition of 8 M urea and refolded by rapid dilution. The protein has been purified by conventional techniques and crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using sodium citrate as the precipitant. Two crystal forms representing the free enzyme and the binary complex with NADP(+) grow under these conditions. Crystals of form I diffract to beyond 3.5 A resolution and belong to the hexagonal space group P622, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 89.1, c = 214.6 A, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees. Crystals of form II diffract to greater than 2.0 A and belong to the orthorhombic space group I222 or I2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 61.8, b = 110.9, c = 151.7 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90 degrees. Calculated values for V(M) and consideration of the packing for both crystal forms suggests that the asymmetric units in both crystal forms contain a monomer.	2001 Dec	Ferrer J,Fisher M,Burke J,Sedelnikova S E,Baker P J,Gilmour D J,Bonete M J,Pire C,Esclapez J,Rice D W	Acta crystallographica.

16200391	Gene cloning, heterologous overexpression and optimized refolding of the NAD-glutamate dehydrogenase from Haloferax mediterranei.	The NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) gene from the halophilic archaeon Haloferax mediterranei has been cloned. The analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame of 1323 bp that encodes a NAD-GDH. The amino acid sequence displayed high homology with those from other sources, especially the highly conserved residues involved in 2-oxoglutarate binding. The expression of this gene in Escherichia coli, the refolding and further characterization, yielded a fully active NAD-GDH with the same features than those found for the wild-type enzyme. This halophilic NAD-GDH showed a highly dependence on salts for both stability and activity, being essential for the refolding of the recombinant enzyme.	2006 Apr	Díaz Susana,Pérez-Pomares Francisco,Pire Carmen,Ferrer Juan,Bonete María-José	Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions. 10(2) 105-15	NAD specific glutamate dehydrogenase	MQTSEPEGSSPNTAEAASQSSEPKPASESALETARRQLYRAADHLDIDPNVVERLKHPEAVHEVTVPIERDDGSVSVYTGYRAQHDSVRGPYKGGLRYHPGVTRDECVGLRMWMTWKTEVRRDGPIFGGAKGGIAVNPKDLTLDEKERLTRRFTQEIRTIIGPMKDIPAPDMGTDPQTMAWVMDAYSMQEGETVPGVVTGKPPIVGGSEGRDTAPGRSVAIIAREAIDYLSWDIEDTTVAVQGFGSVGAPAARLLDDYGANVVAVSDVNGAIYDPDGLDTHAIPTHEEEPEAVMTHDAPETFSNEELLELDVDVLIPAAVGNVLTAENADDVQANLIVEGANGPTTSAADANFAERGVPVIPDILANAGGVTVSYFEWLQDINRRTWSLERVHDELETEMLNAWSVVRDEYESRDVPWRDAAYIVALSRIAAAHDARGLWP		Q977U6			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15477086	Purification of the recombinant human serotonin N-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.87): further characterization of and comparison with AANAT from other species.	Melatonin is synthesized by a series of enzymes, the penultimate one, serotonin N-acetyltransferase, catalyzing the limiting reaction. In the present study, we compared the recombinant serotonin N-acetyltransferases from rat, ovine, and human. The human protein is particularly difficult to purify because it interacts strongly with a putative chaperone protein from bacteria whereas the rat and sheep enzymes, which interact less strongly with this protein, have been purified close to homogeneity. We identified the contaminating protein as GroEL, the bacterial equivalent of Hsp60. We present numerous catalytic activities (substrate and cosubstrate specificities as well as inhibitor specificities) measured on the three species enzymes from which we deduced that the presence of the chaperone might partly explain the differences between the various species enzyme characteristics, beside the inter-species ones resulting from sequence differences. Despite several trials reported in the literature, a purification to homogeneity of the human (recombinant) enzyme has never been described. We present a new purification method, by using an original denaturation/renaturation process in which the enzyme is immobilized on an affinity chromatography column. The enzyme is then eluted in an active and pure form (i.e., absence of chaperone). The up-scaled system permitted us to perform the necessary experiments for the measurement of more accurate affinities of human serotonin N-acetyltransferase towards its main natural substrates, showing that only the activity of the enzyme towards phenylethylamine was modified.	2004 Nov	Ferry Gilles,Ubeaud Caroline,Dauly Claire,Mozo Julien,Guillard Sophie,Berger Sylvie,Jimenez Sandrine,Scoul Catherine,Leclerc Gregory,Yous Saïd,Delagrange Philippe,Boutin Jean A	Protein expression and purification. 38(1) 84-98	Serotonin N-acetyltransferase	MSTQSTHPLKPEAPRLPPGIPESPSCQRRHTLPASEFRCLTPEDAVSAFEIEREAFISVLGVCPLYLDEIRHFLTLCPELSLGWFEEGCLVAFIIGSLWDKERLMQESLTLHRSGGHIAHLHVLAVHRAFRQQGRGPILLWRYLHHLGSQPAVRRAALMCEDALVPFYERFSFHAVGPCAITVGSLTFMELHCSLRGHPFLRRNSGC	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q16613			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

9712911	Expression in Escherichia coli, functional characterization, and tissue distribution of isoforms A and B of the phosphate carrier from bovine mitochondria.	The two isoforms of the mammalian mitochondrial phosphate carrier (PiC), A and B, differing in the sequence near the N terminus, arise from alternative splicing of a primary transcript of the PiC gene (Dolce, V., Iacobazzi, V., Palmieri, F., and Walker, J. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10451-10460). To date, the PiC isoforms A and B have not been studied at the protein level. To explore the tissue-distribution and the potential functional differences between the two isoforms, polyclonal site-directed antibodies specific for PiC-A and PiC-B were raised, and the two bovine isoforms were obtained by expression in Escherichia coli and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. Western blot analysis demonstrated that isoform A is present in high amounts in heart, skeletal muscle, and diaphragm mitochondria, whereas isoform B is present in the mitochondria of all tissues examined. Heart and liver bovine mitochondria contained 69 and 0 pmol of PiC-A/mg of protein, and 10 and 8 pmol of PiC-B/mg of protein, respectively. In the reconstituted system the pure recombinant isoforms A and B both catalyzed the two known modes of transport (Pi/Pi antiport and Pi/H+ symport) and exhibited similar properties of substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity. However, they strongly differed in their kinetic parameters. The transport affinities of isoform B for phosphate and arsenate were found to be 3-fold lower than those of isoform A. Furthermore, the maximum transport rate of isoform B is about 3-fold higher than that of isoform A. These results support the hypothesis that the sequence divergence between PiC-A and PiC-B may have functional significance in determining the affinity and the translocation rate of the substrate through the PiC molecule.	1998 Aug	Fiermonte G,Dolce V,Palmieri F	The Journal of biological chemistry. 273(35) 22782-7	Phosphate carrier protein, mitochondrial	AVEEQYSCDYGSGRFFILCGLGGIISCGTTHTALVPLDLVKCRMQVDPQKYKSIFNGFSVTLKEDGFRGLAKGWAPTFIGYSLQGLCKFGFYEVFKVLYSNMLGEENAYLWRTSLYLAASASAEFFADIALAPMEAAKVRIQTQPGYANTLRDAAPKMYKEEGLKAFYKGVAPLWMRQIPYTMMKFACFERTVEALYKFVVPKPRSECSKPEQLVVTFVAGYIAGVFCAIVSHPADSVVSVLNKEKGSSASEVLKRLGFRGVWKGLFARIIMIGTLTALQWFIYDSVKVYFRLPRPPPPEMPESLKKKLGYTQ	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P12234			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18367408	Expression, refolding, and purification of a truncated human Delta-like1, a ligand of Notch receptors.	The Notch signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in proliferation, apoptosis, and cell fate specification in both embryonic and postnatal development, and is a potential therapeutic target for human diseases such as cancer. To express in Escherichia coli and purify soluble fragment of human Delta-like1 (hDll1), we cloned two extracellular fragments of hDll1 [hDll1 (127-225) and hDll1 (26-225)]. The hDll1 (127-225) fragment was successfully expressed in E. coli as a GST fusion protein (GST-hDll1). The GST-hDll1 protein, which was expressed as inclusion bodies after induction by IPTG, was refolded and purified simultaneously using affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. The purified GST-hDll1 was of more than 95d0c850urity, and had a molecular weight of 39kDa. Reporter assay showed that GST-hDll1 could activate a reporter gene that is dependent on Notch activation. Therefore, using the E. coli expression system and different chromatography systems, we successfully expressed, refolded, and purified a biologically active GST-hDll1, which might be potentially useful for therapy and studying the Notch pathway.	2008 Jun	Shi Zhan-Xia,He Fei,Wang Li-Li,Liang Ying-Min,Han Hua,Wang Chao-Zhan,Zhao Qun,Geng Xin-Du	Protein expression and purification. 59(2) 242-8	Delta-like1	HTDSPDDLATENPERLISRLATQRHLTVGEEWSQDLHSSGRTDLKYSYRFVCDEHYYGEGCSVFCRPRDDAFGHFTCGERGEKVCNPGWKGPYCTEPI		O00548		hDll1 (127窶・25)	7	0	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12429117	Fusion proteins containing neuropeptides as novel insect contol agents: snowdrop lectin delivers fused allatostatin to insect haemolymph following oral ingestion.	The mannose-binding lectin from snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin: GNA), when fed to insects, binds to the gut epithelium and passes into the haemolymph. The potential for GNA to act as a carrier protein to deliver an insect neuropeptide, Manduca sexta allatostatin (Manse-AS), to the haemolymph of lepidopteran larvae has been examined by expressing a GNA/Manse-AS fusion protein (FP) in Escherichia coli, and feeding purified FP to larvae of the tomato moth Lacanobia oleracea. FP, administered at 1.5 or 0.50f dietary proteins, was found to strongly inhibit feeding and prevent growth of fifth stadium larvae, whereas neither GNA nor Manse-AS alone, nor a mixture of GNA and Manse-AS in control treatments, had deleterious effects at similar levels. Elevated levels of material reacting with anti-Manse-AS antibodies were detected in the haemolymph of insects fed diets containing FP, suggesting that transport of the peptide had occurred. Evidence for the delivery of intact FP to the haemolymph was provided by the co-elution of Manse-AS-like immunoreactivity with standard FP after size exclusion chromatography of haemolymph from FP-fed larvae. GNA/Manse-AS and similar fusion proteins offer a novel and effective strategy for delivering insect neuropeptides by oral administration, which could be used in conjunction with expression in transgenic plants to give crop protection in the field.	2002 Dec	Fitches Elaine,Audsley Neil,Gatehouse John A,Edwards John P	Insect biochemistry and molecular biology. 32(12) 1653-61	Mannose-binding lectin	SCLSDNILYSGETLSTGEFLNYGSFVFIMQEDCNLVLYDVDKPIWATNTGGLSRSCFLSMQTDGNLVVYNPSNKPIWASNTGGQNGNYVCILQKDRNVVIYGTDRWATG	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P30617			7.8	0	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10419816	Purification and crystallization of rhizopuspepsin: the use of nickel chelation chromatography to select for catalytically active species.	A new method to obtain pure zymogen-derived peptidases is presented. The key strategy is to install a polyhistidine peptide tag on the N-terminus of the propeptide sequence of a zymogen. After expression, purification, and folding of the protein, autocatalytic posttranslational cleavage and filtration through a nickel affinity column gives pure, functional peptidase. This method takes advantage of the nickel affinity chromatography system that removes both zymogen peptide and nonfunctional folded peptidase without the need to use external enzymes to remove, often incompletely, the resulting fusion peptide. This technique was used to prepare the aspartic peptidase rhizopuspepsin. His-tagged rhizopuspepsinogen was expressed, and the desired protein was isolated as inclusion bodies and refolded. The proenzyme was purified by normal methods and then the relatively pure proenzyme was activated via intramolecular proteolysis at low pH. The propeptide and any inactive rhizopuspepsinogen were removed via affinity chromatography. This procedure yields a highly active rhizopuspepsin in 99d0c850urity, which was demonstrated by PAGE, protein sequencing, and X-ray crystallography (1.5 A) of the isolated peptidase. A new fluorescent assay system is introduced for rhizopuspepsin, utilizing the substrate KPVSY(4-NO(3)-F)RL. The kinetics constants were K(m) = 3.4 microM +/- 0.31 and k(cat) = 55 +/- 1.0 s(-1).	1999 Jul	Flentke G R,Glinski J,Satyshur K,Rich D H	Protein expression and purification. 16(2) 213-20	Rhizopuspepsin	AGVGTVPMTDYGNDVEYYGQVTIGTPGKKFNLDFDTGSSDLWIASTLCTNCGSRQTKYDPKQSSTYQADGRTWSISYGDGSSASGILAKDNVNLGGLLIKGQTIELAKREAASFANGPNDGLLGLGFDTITTVRGVKTPMDNLISQGLISRPIFGVYLGKASNGGGGEYIFGGYDSTKFKGSLTTVPIDNSRGWWGITVDRATVGTSTVASSFDGILDTGTTLLILPNNVAASVARAYGASDNGDGTYTISCDTSRFKPLVFSINGASFQVSPDSLVFEEYQGQCIAGFGYGNFDFAIIGDTFLKNNYVVFNQGVPEVQIAPVAQ	N-terminal polyhistidine peptide tag	P06026				0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
18211716	Coutilization of glucose and glycerol enhances the production of aromatic compounds in an Escherichia coli strain lacking the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system.	BACKGROUND:Escherichia coli strains lacking the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) are capable of coutilizing glucose and other carbon sources due to the absence of catabolite repression by glucose. In these strains, the lack of this important regulatory and transport system allows the coexistence of glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. Strains lacking PTS have been constructed with the goal of canalizing part of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) not consumed in glucose transport to the aromatic pathway. The deletion of the ptsHIcrr operon inactivates PTS causing poor growth on this sugar; nonetheless, fast growing mutants on glucose have been isolated (PB12 strain). However, there are no reported studies concerning the growth potential of a PTS- strain in mixtures of different carbon sources to enhance the production of aromatics compounds.RESULTS:PB12 strain is capable of coutilizing mixtures of glucose-arabinose, glucose-gluconate and glucose-glycerol. This capacity increases its specific growth rate (mu) given that this strain metabolizes more moles of carbon source per unit time. The presence of plasmids pRW300aroGfbr and pCLtktA reduces the mu of strain PB12 in all mixtures of carbon sources, but enhances the productivity and yield of aromatic compounds, especially in the glucose-glycerol mixture, as compared to glucose or glycerol cultures. No acetate was detected in the glycerol and the glucose-glycerol batch fermentations.CONCLUSION:Due to the lack of catabolite repression, PB12 strain carrying multicopy plasmids containing tktA and aroGfbr genes is capable of coutilizing glucose and other carbon sources; this capacity, reduces its mu but increases the production of aromatic compounds.	2008 	Martínez Karla,de Anda Ramón,Hernández Georgina,Escalante Adelfo,Gosset Guillermo,Ramírez Octavio T,Bolívar Francisco G	Microbial cell factories. 7 1	Osmotin-like protein	MGYLRSSFVFFLLTFVTYTYATSFEVRNNCPYTVWAASTPIGGGRRLDRGQTWVINAPRGTSMARIWGRTNCNFDGAGRGSCQTGDCGGVLQCTGWGKPPNTLAEYALNQFSNLDFWDISLVDGFNIPMTFAPTNPSGGKCHSIQCTANINGECPAALRVPGGCNNPCTTFGGQQYCCTQGPCGPTELSKFFKQRCPDAYSYPQDDPTSTFTCPSDSTNYRVVFCPNGVTSPNFPLEMPSSTDEVAK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8SA57			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15843371	Cellular fibronectin binds to lysyl oxidase with high affinity and is critical for its proteolytic activation.	Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a copper-containing amine oxidase known to catalyze the covalent cross-linking of fibrillar collagens and elastin at peptidyl lysine residues. In addition, its involvement in cancer, wound healing, cell motility, chemotaxis, and differentiation reflect a remarkable functional diversity of LOX. To investigate novel mechanisms of LOX regulation and function, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify LOX-interacting proteins. Three overlapping positive clones were identified as C-terminal fragments of fibronectin (FN). Glutathione S-transferase pull-downs and solid phase binding assays confirmed this interaction. LOX binds to the cellular form of FN (cFN) with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 2.5 nm. This was comparable with our measured K(d) of LOX binding to tropoelastin (1.9 nm) and type I collagen (5.2 nm), but LOX demonstrated a much lower binding affinity for the plasma form of FN (pFN). Immunofluorescent microscopy revealed co-localization of FN and LOX in normal human tissues, where these proteins may interact in vivo. LOX enzymatic activity assays showed that cFN does not seem to be a substrate of LOX. However, cFN can act as a scaffold for enzymatically active 30-kDa LOX. Furthermore, in FN-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we observed dramatically decreased proteolytic processing of the 45-kDa LOX proenzyme to the 30-kDa active form, with a corresponding decrease in LOX enzyme activity. Our results suggest that the FN matrix may provide specific microenvironments to regulate LOX catalytic activity.	2005 Jul	Fogelgren Ben,Polgár Noémi,Szauter Kornélia Molnárné,Ujfaludi Zsuzsanna,Laczkó Rozália,Fong Keith S K,Csiszar Katalin	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(26) 24690-7	Lysyl oxidase	MRLTNLLSLTTLVALAVAVPDFYQKREAVSSKEAALLRRDASAECVSNENVEIEAPKTNIWTSLAKEEVQEVLDLLHSTYNITEVTKADFFSNYVLWIETLKPNKTEALTYLDEDGDLPPRNARTVVYFGEGEEGYFEELKVGPLPVSDETTIEPLSFYNTNGKSKLPFEVGHLDRIKSAAKSSFLNKNLNTTIMRDVLEGLIGVPYEDMGCHSAAPQLHDPATGATVDYGTCNINTENDAENLVPTGFFFKFDMTGRDVSQWKMLEYIYNNKVYTSAEELYEAMQKDDFVTLPKIDVDNLDWTVIQRNDSAPIRHLDDRKSPRLVEPEGRRWAYDGEEEYFSWMDWGFYTSWSRDTGISFYDITFKGERIVYELSLQELIAEYGSDDPFNQHTFYSDISYGVGNRFSLVPGYDCPATAGYFTTDTFEYDEFYNRTLSYCVFENQEDYSLLRHTGASYSAITQNPTLNVRFISTIGNYDYNFLYKFFLDGTLEVSVRAAGYIQAGYWNPETSAPYGLKIHDVLSGSFHDHVLNYKVDLDVGGTKNRASKYVMKDVDVEYPWAPGTVYNTKQIAREVLEKEDFNGINWPENGQGILLIESAEETNSFGNPRAYNIMPGGGGVHRIVKNSRSGPETQNWARSNLFLTKHKDEELRSSTALNTNALYDPPVNFNAFLDDESLDGEDIVAWVNLGLHHLPNSNDLPNTIFSTAHASFMLTPFNYFDSENSRDTTQQVFYTYDDETEESNWEFYGNDWSSCGLEVPEPNFEDYTYGRGTRINKKMTNSDEVY	N-terminal GST				8.2	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16157297	Biochemical basis for retinol deficiency induced by the I41N and G75D mutations in human plasma retinol-binding protein.	Retinol-binding protein (RBP) is the retinol-specific carrier protein present in plasma, where it circulates almost entirely bound to thyroxine-binding transthyretin (TTR). Recently, depressed plasma retinol and RBP levels in carriers of the I41N and G75D RBP point mutations have been reported. We show here that although recombinant human N41 and D75 RBPs can form complexes with retinol and TTR in vitro, the retinol-mutated RBP complexes are significantly less stable than human normal holo-RBP, as revealed by the markedly facilitated retinol release by mutated holo-RBPs to phospholipid membranes, in accordance with the location of mutated residues inside the RBP retinol-binding cavity. Taken together, the data are consistent with the I41N and G75D point mutations being the cause of an altered interaction of retinol with RBP, resulting in a remarkably reduced stability of the retinol-RBP complex, which in turn can lead to the lowering of plasma retinol and RBP levels.	2005 Nov	Folli Claudia,Viglione Simona,Busconi Marco,Berni Rodolfo	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 336(4) 1017-22	Plasma retinol-binding protein	ERDCRVSSFRVKENFDKARFSGTWYAMAKKDPEGLFLQDNIVAEFSVDETGQMSATAKGRVRLLNNWDVCADMVGTFTDTEDPAKFKMKYWGVASFLQKGNDDHWIVDTDYDTYAVQYSCRLLNLDGTCADSYSFVFSRDPNGLPPEAQKIVRQRQEELCLARQYRLIVHNGYCDGRSERNLL		P02753			9.3	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12237472	Bacterial expression and membrane targeting of the rat complement regulator Crry: a new model anticomplement therapeutic.	Inappropriate or unregulated activation of complement can contribute to pathology in inflammatory diseases. Previous studies have shown that soluble recombinant regulators of complement are effective in animal models and some human diseases. However, limitations include cost, rapid clearance, and unwanted systemic effects. To avoid some of these problems, bacterial expression of regulators has been optimized and methods for the addition of a membrane-targeting moiety to the complement regulator developed. When administered directly to sites of inflammation, membrane-targeted human regulators are retained and inhibit complement-activation locally. To test the efficacy of membrane-targeted complement regulators in vivo, we have undertaken the expression and membrane targeting of the rat-complement regulator Crry. A soluble recombinant form of Crry, containing only the first four short consensus repeats, was expressed in a mammalian expression system and shown to be functional as a fluid phase regulator. To generate the quantities required for testing in vivo, Crry was expressed in bacteria and refolded successfully. Refolded protein had full-complement regulatory activity in vitro. Attachment of a membrane address tag conferred membrane-binding capacity and greatly increased complement regulatory function in vitro. This novel anticomplement agent can now be applied to rat models of arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.	2002 Oct	Fraser Deborah A,Harris Claire L,Smith Richard A G,Morgan B Paul	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 11(10) 2512-21	Complement regulatory protein Crry	GQCPAPPLFPYAKPINPTDESTFPVGTSLKYECRPGYIKRQFSITCEVNSVWTSPQDVCIRKQCETPLDPQNGIVHVNTDIRFGSSITYTCNEGYRLIGSSSAMCIISDQSVAWDAEAPICESIPCEIPPSIPNGDFFSPNREDFHYGMVVTYQCNTDARGKKLFNLVGEPSIHCTSIDGQVGVWSGPPPQCIELNKCTPPHVENAVIVSKNKSLFSLRDMVEFRCQDGFMMKGDSSVYCRSLNRWEPQLPSCFKVKSCGAFLGELPNGHVFVPQNLQLGAKVTFVCNTGYQLKGNSSSHCVLDGVESIWNSSVPVCEQVICKLPQDMSGFQKGLQMKKDYYYGDNVALECEDGYTLEGSSQSQCQSDASWDPPLPKCVSQVICKLPQDMSGFQKGLQMKKDYYYGDNVALECEDGYTLEGSSQSQCQSDASWDPPLPKCVSRSNSGLIAGIFIGIIVLILFIIFSYWMIMKFKKRNSTNEKCKEVGIYLNSKEDSCVQPQSLLTSQENNSTSSPARNSLTQEV		Q63135			11	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15474537	Salmon growth hormone receptor: molecular cloning, ligand specificity, and response to fasting.	To better understand the role of growth hormone in regulating fish growth, the cDNA of growth hormone receptor (GHR) was cloned from the liver of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) and characterized. The masu salmon GHR (msGHR) sequence revealed common features of a GHR, including a (Y/F)GEFS motif in the extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and Box 1 and Box 2 in the intracellular domain. However, the amino acid sequence identity was low (49%) compared to GHRs of other vertebrates including seven teleosts, and the putative msGHR protein lacked one pair of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain. To verify the identity of the msGHR, the recombinant protein of the extracellular domain was expressed with a histidine tag protein (His-msGHR-ECD), refolded and purified for analysis of its ligand specificity. In competition experiments, the specific binding between His-msGHR-ECD and radioiodine-labeled salmon GH was displaced completely by only salmon GH, and not by salmon prolactin or somatolactin. A real-time RT-PCR assay was used to measure salmon GHR mRNA in the liver of fed and fasted coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). The levels of hepatic GHR mRNA were lower in fasted fish compared to fed fish after 3 weeks, suggesting that GHR gene expression is reduced following a long-term fast. These results confirm the identity of the salmon GHR based on ligand specificity and response to fasting.	2004 Oct	Fukada Haruhisa,Ozaki Yuichi,Pierce Andrew L,Adachi Shinji,Yamauchi Kohei,Hara Akihiko,Swanson Penny,Dickhoff Walton W	General and comparative endocrinology. 139(1) 61-71	Growth Hormone Receptor	EPPTSEQALPQIRPQITGCVSHDMNTFRCRWNVGTFQNLTEPRDLRMFYYINNKNISPKEWSECPNYMADRIDECFFNESYTKVWITYSVQLRSGDQDNLYDEVIFTVEEIVEPDPPIALNWTLLNVGLTGSHFDIMVSWEPPHSADVSMGWMTLQYEVQYREVNSTLWRMVNLEKGRQRSLYGLRTNTDHEVRVRCKTLASRNFGEFSDPIVIHIPTKESR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q90W21		extracellular domain o ms GHR	8	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16489914	Biochemical characterization of human enteropeptidase light chain.	The synthetic gene encoding human enteropeptidase light chain (L-HEP) was cloned into plasmid pET-32a downstream from the gene of fusion partner thioredoxin immediately after the DNA sequence encoding the enteropeptidase recognition site. The fusion protein thioredoxin (Trx)/L-HEP was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). Autocatalytic cleavage of the fusion protein and activation of recombinant L-HEP were achieved by solubilization of inclusion bodies and refolding of Trx/L-HEP fusion protein. The kinetic parameters of human and bovine enteropeptidases in the presence of different concentrations of Ca2+ and Na+ for cleavage of the specific substrate GD4K-na and nonspecific substrates such as small ester Z-Lys-SBzl and chromogenic substrates Z-Ala-X-Arg-pNA have been comparatively analyzed. It is demonstrated that positively charged ions increased the Michaelis constant (Km) for cleavage of specific substrate GD4K-na, while the catalytic constant (k(cat)) remained practically unchanged. L-HEP demonstrated secondary specificity to the chromogenic substrate Z-Ala-Phe-Arg-pNA with k(cat)/Km 260 mM(-1) x sec(-1). Enzymatic activity of L-HEP was suppressed by inhibitors of trypsin-like and cysteine (E-64), but not metallo-, amino-, or chymotrypsin-like proteinases. L-HEP was active over a broad range of pH (6-9) with optimum activity at pH 7.5, and it demonstrated high stability to different denaturing agents.	2006 Feb	Gasparian M E,Ostapchenko V G,Dolgikh D A,Kirpichnikov M P	Biochemistry.

16260150	An optimized system for expression and purification of secreted bacterial proteins.	In this report, we describe an optimized system for the efficient overexpression, purification, and refolding of secreted bacterial proteins. Candidate secreted proteins were produced recombinantly in Escherichia coli as Tobacco Etch Virus protease-cleavable hexahistidine-c-myc eptiope fusion proteins. Without regard to their initial solubility, recombinant fusion proteins were extracted from whole cells with guanidium chloride, purified under denaturing conditions by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and refolded by rapid dilution into a solution containing only Tris buffer and sodium chloride. Following concentration on the same resin under native conditions, each protein was eluted for further purification and/or characterization. Preliminary studies on a test set of 12 secreted proteins ranging in size from 13 to 130 kDa yielded between 10 and 50 mg of fusion protein per liter of induced culture at greater than 90d0c850urity, as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Of the nine proteins further purified, analytical gel filtration chromatography indicated that each was a monomer in solution and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that each had adopted a well-defined secondary structure. While there are many potential applications for this system, the results presented here suggest that it will be particularly useful for investigators employing structural approaches to understand protein function, as attested to by the crystal structures of three proteins purified using this methodology (B.V.

Preliminary studies on a test set of 12 secreted proteins ranging in size from 13 to 130 kDa yielded between 10 and 50 mg of fusion protein per liter of induced culture at greater than 90d0c850urity, as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE. Of the nine proteins further purified, analytical gel filtration chromatography indicated that each was a monomer in solution and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that each had adopted a well-defined secondary structure. While there are many potential applications for this system, the results presented here suggest that it will be particularly useful for investigators employing structural approaches to understand protein function, as attested to by the crystal structures of three proteins purified using this methodology (B.V.

15153102	A Kazal prolyl endopeptidase inhibitor isolated from the skin of Phyllomedusa sauvagii.	Searching for bioactive peptides, we analyzed acidic extracts of Phyllomedusa sauvagii skin and found two new proteins, PSKP-1 and PSKP-2, of 6.7 and 6.6 kDa, respectively, which, by sequence homology, belong to the Kazal family of serine protease inhibitors. PSKP-1 and PSKP-2 exhibit the unprecedented feature of having proline at P(1) and P(2) positions. A gene encoding PSKP-1 was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant PSKP-1 was purified from inclusion bodies, oxidatively refolded to the native state, and characterized by chemical, hydrodynamic and optical studies. PSKP-1 shows inhibitory activity against a serum prolyl endopeptidase, but is unable to inhibit trypsin, chymotrypsin, V8 protease, or proteinase K. In addition, PSKP-1 can be rendered active against trypsin by active-site site-specific mutagenesis, has bactericidal activity, and induces agglutination of red cells at micromolar concentrations. PSKP-1 might protect P. sauvagii teguments from microbial invasion, by acting as an inhibitor of an as-yet unidentified prolyl endopeptidase or directly as a microbicidal compound.	2004 Jun	Gebhard Leopoldo G,Carrizo Federico U,Stern Ana L,Burgardt Noelia I,Faivovich Julián,Lavilla Esteban,Ermácora Mario R	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 271(11) 2117-26	Proteinase inhibitor PSKP-1	VIEPKCYKYEGKKCPPDINPVCGTDKRTYYNECALCVFIRQSTKKADKAIKIKKWGKC		P83578			7.5	5	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

16009582	Recombinant human hepcidin expressed in Escherichia coli isolates as an iron containing protein.	Hepcidin is a small peptide that acts as a regulator of systemic iron homeostasis. To study some of its functional properties, a synthetic cDNA for the minimal, 20-amino-acid, form of human hepcidin was cloned into different constructs for expression in Escherichia coli. The fusion ferritin-hepcidin produced molecules retaining most of ferritin structural and functional properties, including ferroxidase and iron incorporation activities. However, it showed spectroscopic properties compatible with the presence of iron-sulfur complexes on the hepcidin moiety, which was buried into protein cavity. Similar complexes were reconstituted by in vitro incubation of the iron-free protein with iron and sulfide salts. Two other unrelated fusion products were constructed, which, when expressed in E. coli, formed insoluble aggregates retaining a large proportion of total bacterial iron. Analysis of the solubilized preparations showed them to contain iron-sulfur complexes. We concluded that the cysteine-rich hepcidin acts as an iron-sequestering molecule during expression in E. coli. This may have implications for the biological functions of this key protein of iron metabolism.

8930606	Production of recombinant insulin-like growth factor-II in the development of a radioimmunoassay in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).	Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and cloned into an expression vector (parHS3) for production by Escherichia coli. Recombinant rainbow trout IGF-II (rtIGF-II) was recovered from bacterial inclusion bodies, solubilized, and purified by gel filtration chromatography under reducing conditions. After refolding of the peptide by dialysis at basic pH, we obtained a final yield of 820 micrograms/liter culture medium. The rtIGF-II appeared as a single band estimated at 80% and with molecular mass of 7.5 kDa. A homologous radioimmunoassay (RIA) for the measurement of IGF-II in trout plasma has been developed using rtIGF-II as antigen, radiolabeled tracer, and standard. RIA sensitivity was 0.1 ng/ml and the ED50 was 0.75 +/- 0.06 ng/ml. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 4.04% (n = 6) and 4.56% (n = 9), respectively, at ED50 levels. Cross-reactivities of 1 and 0.1% were found for recombinant coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) IGF-I and coho salmon insulin, respectively. No cross-reactivities were found for recombinant human IGF-I and IGF-II, porcine insulin, or a variety of salmonid pituitary hormones. The interference of IGF binding proteins (IGFBP) in the RIA has been tested with and without extraction (acid/ethanol extraction or C-25 acid chromatography) of fed and fasted trout plasma samples. Parallel displacement curves were obtained for unextracted and C-25-extracted plasma but not for acid/ethanol-extracted plasma. Comparison of IGF-II levels from these samples showed a possible interference of IGFBP in the RIA in fed (19.6 +/- 1.56 ng/ml unextracted and 25.25 +/- 1.21 ng/ml extracted) and fasted (21.58 +/- 1.02 ng/ml unextracted and 9.86 +/- 1.68 ng/ml extracted) trout plasma. Finally, the displacement curves for unextracted plasma from rainbow trout, Couch&#39;s sea bream (Pagrus pagrus), and carp (Cyprinus carpio) were parallel to that of the rtIGF-II standard and not strictly parallel for tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and catfish (Silurus glanis) plasma. No significant cross-reaction occurred with eel (Anguilla anguilla) plasma. The rainbow trout IGF-II RIA reported in this study has low variability and is highly sensitive. Therefore it is a reliable method for measuring IGF-II levels in salmonids and some nonsalmonid fish species.	1996 Nov	Gentil V,Martin P,Smal J,Le Bail P Y	General and comparative endocrinology. 104(2) 156-67	Insulin-like growth factor II	EVASAETLCGGELVDALQFVCEDRGFYFSRPTSRSNSRRSQNRGIVEECCFRSCDLNLLEQYCAKPAKSE		Q02816			8.5	20	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

15752699	The first archaeal agmatinase from anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii: cloning, expression, and characterization.	Agmatinase is one of the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of polyamines such as putrescine and sperimidine from arginine in microorganisms. The gene (PH0083) encoding the putative agmatinase of hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii was identified based on the genome database. The gene was cloned and expressed, and the product was mainly obtained as inactive inclusion body in Escherichia coli. The inclusion body was dissolved in 6 M guanidine-HCl and successively refolded to active enzyme by the dilution of the denaturant. The enzyme exclusively catalyzed the hydrolysis of agmatine, but not arginine. This indicates that PH0083 codes agmatinase. The enzyme required divalent cations such as Co(2+), Ca(2+) and Mn(2+) for the activity. The highest activity was observed under fairly alkaline conditions, like pH 11. The purified recombinant enzyme consisted of four identical subunits with a molecular mass of 110-145 kDa. The enzyme was extremely thermostable: the full activity was retained on heating at 80 degrees C for 10 min, and a half of the activity was retained by incubation at 90 degrees C for 10 min. From a typical Michaelis-Menten type kinetics, an apparent K(m) value for agmatine was determined to be 0.53 mM. Phylogenic analysis revealed that the agmatinase from P. horikoshii does not belong to any clusters of enzymes found in bacteria and eukarya. This is the first description of the presence of archaeal agmatinase and its characteristics.	2005 Apr	Goda Shuichiro,Sakuraba Haruhiko,Kawarabayasi Yutaka,Ohshima Toshihisa	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1748(1) 110-5	Agmatinase	MLLYTYRSFDMELPTVDIKDADYIILGLPFDGTTSYKPGARFGPVLIRQATLNLESYILDYDIDIAELKIADAGDVALPVSIEDAIKVAVETIKEVRSINPRALPIFLGGEHSMTYPPVKVLEPKSYVVFDAHLDLRDSYQGSRFNHACVARRIHEMGVKVAIFGVRSGTREEVMFASQSGIEWVHARDYNFDAFVDLVSSLPEPVYVSIDVDVFDLPLVPETGTPEPGGLGFWEVIEALEWLTKRKKVAGFDIMEVSGDRLGNSTSITAAKLLFYVIGMSAR		O57839			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7979386	Heterologous expression of gamma E-crystallin produces protein with an aberrant tertiary structure.	Expression of complete rat gamma E-crystallin cDNA in Saccheromyces cerevisiae and in Escherichia coli at 25 degrees C produced soluble proteins similar to rat gamma E-crystallin but with an altered tertiary structure as judged by tryptophan fluorescence. Expression of rat gamma E-crystallin cDNA in E. coli at 37 degrees C produced insoluble inclusion bodies. Refolding of denatured rat gamma E-crystallin from these inclusion bodies produced a protein similar to rat gamma E-crystallin but with altered secondary and tertiary structure, judged by tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism. The secondary structure of the refolded gamma-crystallin was similar in beta-sheet content to the native gamma-crystallin structure but was somewhat shifted from the native spectrum, suggesting some alteration in the relative position of the beta-sheets in the refolded structure. These results have implications for crystallin folding, in particular the importance of lens-specific factors (alpha-crystallin, low water content, redox potential) and crystallin hydration.	1994 Nov	Goode D,Crabbe M J	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 315(1) 104-10	Gamma-crystallin E	GKITFYEDRGFQGRHYECSTDHSNLQPYFSRCNSVRVDSGCWMLYEQPNFTGCQYFLRRGDYPDYQQWMGFSDSVRSCRLIPHSSSHRIRIYEREDYRGQMVEITDDCPHLQDRFHFSDFHSFHVMEGYWVLYEMPNYRGRQYLLRPGEYRRYHDWGAMNARVGSLRRIMDFY					8.4	30	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f
9786911	Biochemical and biophysical characterization of refolded Drosophila DPP, a homolog of bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4.	The mature C-terminal signaling domain of the Drosophila Decapentaplegic proprotein (DPP) can be efficiently refolded from chaotrope-solubilized inclusion bodies with the aid of a membrane protein-solubilizing detergent, high concentrations (0.75-2 M) of NaCl, and low temperatures (5-15 degreesC). The disulfide-linked homodimeric product contains N-terminal heparin-binding sites that were utilized as intrinsic affinity tags to obtain a highly enriched preparation in one chromatographic step. A subsequent C4 reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography step provides high purity, salt-free protein that is amenable to biophysical and structural studies at a yield of approximately 3 mg/liter of bacterial culture. The dimeric protein is correctly folded as determined by electrophoretic, spectroscopic, chemical, and proteolytic analyses. Refolded DPP is also bioactive as shown by induction of chondrogenesis in embryonic chick limb bud cells and by high affinity binding to Noggin, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic protein signaling. In contrast to bone morphogenetic proteins extracted from demineralized bone or overexpressed in cell culture, the refolded Escherichia coli-expressed protein is not glycosylated at a conserved N-linked site and is therefore homogeneous. The C-terminal domain dimer is more hydrophobic and thus less soluble than its unfolded or partially folded forms, necessitating highly solubilizing conditions for recovery after folding in vitro. Hence solubilization of the mature ligand may be one of the principal roles of the large (250-400 amino acids) N-terminal prodomains of transforming growth factor-beta superfamily members, shown to act as intramolecular chaperones in vivo.	1998 Oct	Groppe J,Rumpel K,Economides A N,Stahl N,Sebald W,Affolter M	The Journal of biological chemistry. 273(44) 29052-65	Protein decapentaplegic	DVSGGEGGGKGGRNKRQPRRPTRRKNHDDTCRRHSLYVDFSDVGWDDWIVAPLGYDAYYCHGKCPFPLADHFNSTNHAVVQTLVNNMNPGKVPKACCVPTQLDSVAMLYLNDQSTVVLKNYQEMTVVGCGCR				C-terminal domain	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16246846	Characterization of a defensin from the oyster Crassostrea gigas. Recombinant production, folding, solution structure, antimicrobial activities, and gene expression.	In invertebrates, defensins were found in arthropods and in the mussels. Here, we report for the first time the identification and characterization of a defensin (Cg-Def) from an oyster. Cg-def mRNA was isolated from Crassostrea gigas mantle using an expressed sequence tag approach. To gain insight into potential roles of Cg-Def in oyster immunity, we produced the recombinant peptide in Escherichia coli, characterized its antimicrobial activities, determined its solution structure by NMR spectroscopy, and quantified its gene expression in vivo following bacterial challenge of oysters. Recombinant Cg-Def was active in vitro against Gram-positive bacteria but showed no or limited activities against Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. The activity of Cg-Def was retained in vitro at a salt concentration similar to that of seawater. The Cg-Def structure shares the so-called cystine-stabilized alpha-beta motif (CS-alphabeta) with arthropod defensins but is characterized by the presence of an additional disulfide bond, as previously observed in the mussel defensin (MGD-1). Nevertheless, despite a similar global fold, the Cg-Def and MGD-1 structures mainly differ by the size of their loops and by the presence of two aspartic residues in Cg-Def. Distribution of Cg-def mRNA in various oyster tissues revealed that Cg-def is mainly expressed in mantle edge where it was detected by mass spectrometry analyses. Furthermore, we observed that the Cg-def messenger concentration was unchanged after bacterial challenge. Our results suggest that Cg-def gene is continuously expressed in the mantle and would play a key role in oyster by providing a first line of defense against pathogen colonization.	2006 Jan	Gueguen Yannick,Herpin Amaury,Aumelas André,Garnier Julien,Fievet Julie,Escoubas Jean-Michel,Bulet Philippe,Gonzalez Marcelo,Lelong Christophe,Favrel Pascal,Bachère Evelyne	The Journal of biological chemistry. 281(1) 313-23	Defensin	MKVFVLLTLAVLLMVSADMAFAGFGCPGNQLKCNNHCKSISCRAGYCDAATLWLRCTCTDCNGKK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q4GWV4			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11101337	Important parameters affecting efficiency of protein refolding by reversed micelles.	Refolding of denatured RNase A as a model of inclusion bodies was performed by reversed micelles formulated with sodium di-2-ethylhexyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) in isooctane. In the novel refolding process, a solid-liquid extraction was utilized as an alternative to the ordinary protein extraction by reversed micelles based on a liquid-liquid extraction. First, the effects of operational parameters such as concentration of AOT, W(o) (= [H(2)O]/[AOT]), and pH were examined on the solubilization of solid denatured proteins into a reversed micellar solution. The solubilization was facilitated by a high AOT concentration, a high W(o) value, and a high pH in water pools. These conditions are favorable for the dispersion of the solid protein aggregates in an organic solvent. Second, the renaturation of the denatured RNase A solubilized into the reversed micellar solution was conducted by addition of glutathione as a redox reagent. A complete renaturation of RNase A was accomplished by adjusting the composition of the redox reagent even at a high protein concentration in which protein aggregation would usually occur in aqueous media. In addition, the renaturation rates were improved by optimizing water content (W(o)) and the pH of water pools in reversed micelles. Finally, the recovery of renatured RNase A from the reversed micellar solution was performed by adding a polar organic solvent such as acetone into the reversed micellar solution. This precipitation method was effective for recovering proteins from reversed micellar media without any significant reduction in enzymatic activity.

15802237	Refolding, purification, and crystallization of apical membrane antigen 1 from Plasmodium falciparum.	Extracellular domains of malaria antigens almost invariably contain disulphide linkages but lack N- and O-linked glycosylation. The best practical approach to generating recombinant extracellular Plasmodium proteins is not established and the problems encountered when using a bacterial expression/refolding approach are discussed in detail. Limited proteolysis experiments were used to identify a relatively non-flexible core region of the Plasmodium falciparum protein apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1), and refolding/purification was used to generate two fragments of AMA1. Several chromatographically distinct AMA1 variants were identified that are presumably differentially refolded proteins. One of these AMA1 preparations proved to be crystallizable and generated two crystal forms that diffracted X-rays to 2 A resolution.	2005 May	Gupta Aditi,Bai Tao,Murphy Vince,Strike Phillip,Anders Robin F,Batchelor Adrian H	Protein expression and purification. 41(1) 186-98	Apical membrane antigen 1	QNYWEHPYQKSDVYHPINEHREHSKEYEYPLHQEHTYQQEDSGEDENTLQHAYPIDHEGAEPAPQEQNLFSSIEIVERSNYMGNPWTEYMAKYDIKEVHGSGIRVDLGEDAEVAGTQYRLPSGKCPVFGKGIIIENSNTTFLKPVATGNQDLKDGGFAFPPTNPLISPMTLDHMRDFYKNNEYVKNLDELTLCSRHAGNMNPDNDKNSNYKYPAVYDYNDKKCHILYIAAQENNGPRYCNKDESKRNSMFCFRPAKDKSFQNYTYLSKNVVDNWEKVCPRKNLENAKFGLWVDGNCEDIPHVNEFSANDLFECNKLVFELSASDQPKQYEQHLTDYEKIKEGFKNKNASMIKSAFLPTGAFKADRYKSRGKGYNWGNYNRKTQKCEIFNVKPTCLINNSSYIATTALSHPNEVEHNFPCSLYKDEIKKEIERESKRIKLNDNDDEGNKKIIAPRIFISDDIDSLKCPCDPEIVSNSTCNFFVCKCVEKRAEVTSNNEVVVKEEYKDEYADIPEHKPTYDKMKIIIASSAAVAVLATILMVYLYKRKGNAEKYDKMDEPQDYGKSNSRNDEMLDPEASFWGEEKRASHTTPVLMEKPYY	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P50492			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15358358	Intein-mediated fusion expression, high efficient refolding, and one-step purification of gelonin toxin.	An open reading frame of gelonin (Gel), one of ribosome inactivating proteins, was inserted into the vector pBSL-C which contains the coding region of chitin binding domain (CBD)-intein, resulting in the fusion expression of CBD-intein-Gel in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) by the induction of IPTG. The fusion product formed an aggregate of the misfolded protein, commonly referred to as inclusion bodies (IBs). The IBs were denatured and then refolded by step-wise dialysis. About 69 0.000000usion protein was in vitro refolded to native state in the presence of GSSG and GSH as monitored by size-exclusion HPLC. The refolded CBD-intein-Gel was loaded onto chitin beads column equilibrated with 10 mM Tris buffer, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.5, and about 2.4 mgGel/L culture with 960mogeneity was directly eluted from the captured column by incubation at 25 degrees C under pH 6.5 for 48 h based on intein C-terminal self-cleavage. Western blot, ELISA, and in vitro inhibition of protein synthesis demonstrated that the bioactivity of recombinant Gel was comparable to that of native Gel purified from seeds. This implied that the purified Gel by this method is biologically active and suitable for further studies.	2004 Oct	Guo Chenyun,Li Zhuoyu,Shi Yawei,Xu Mingqun,Wise John G,Trommer Wolfgong E,Yuan Jingming	Protein expression and purification. 37(2) 361-7	Ribosome-inactivating protein gelonin	GLDTVSFSTKGATYITYVNFLNELRVKLKPEGNSHGIPLLRKKCDDPGKCFVLVALSNDNGQLAEIAIDVTSVYVVGYQVRNRSYFFKDAPDAAYEGLFKNTIKTRLHFGGSYPSLEGEKAYRETTDLGIEPLRIGIKKLDENAIDNYKPTEIASSLLVVIQMVSEAARFTFIENQIRNNFQQRIRPANNTISLENKWGKLSFQIRTSGANGMFSEAVELERANGKKYYVTAVDQVKPKIALLKFVDKDPK	C-terminal intein	P33186			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
10425157	Expression and purification of the recombinant protective antigen of Bacillus anthracis.	Protective antigen (PA) is a major component of the vaccine against anthrax. The structural gene for the 83-kDa PA was expressed as fusion protein with 6x Histidine residues in Escherichia coli. Expression of PA in E. coli under the transcriptional regulation of the T5 promoter yielded an insoluble protein aggregating to form inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6 M guanidine-HCl and the protein was purified under denaturing conditions using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography. The denatured protein was renatured by gradual removal of the denaturant while immobilized on the Ni-NTA column. The protein was then purified using Mono-Q column on FPLC. The yield of the purified recombinant PA (rPA) from this procedure was 2 mg/liter of the culture. The rPA had an apparent molecular mass of 83 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE. Antisera to native PA recognized the fusion protein. The rPA was biologically as well as functionally active. Thus, the recombinant PA may be used to develop an effective recombinant vaccine against anthrax.	1999 Aug	Gupta P,Waheed S M,Bhatnagar R	Protein expression and purification. 16(3) 369-76	Protective antigen	MKKRKVLIPLMALSTILVSSTGNLEVIQAEVKQENRLLNESESSSQGLLGYYFSDLNFQAPMVVTSSTTGDLSIPSSELENIPSENQYFQSAIWSGFIKVKKSDEYTFATSADNHVTMWVDDQEVINKASNSNKIRLEKGRLYQIKIQYQRENPTEKGLDFKLYWTDSQNKKEVISSDNLQLPELKQKSSNSRKKRSTSAGPTVPDRDNDGIPDSLEVEGYTVDVKNKRTFLSPWISNIHEKKGLTKYKSSPEKWSTASDPYSDFEKVTGRIDKNVSPEARHPLVAAYPIVHVDMENIILSKNEDQSTQNTDSQTRTISKNTSTSRTHTSEVHGNAEVHASFFDIGGSVSAGFSNSNSSTVAIDHSLSLAGERTWAETMGLNTADTARLNANIRYVNTGTAPIYNVLPTTSLVLGKNQTLATIKAKENQLSQILAPNNYYPSKNLAPIALNAQDDFSSTPITMNYNQFLELEKTKQLRLDTDQVYGNIATYNFENGRVRVDTGSNWSEVLPQIQETTARIIFNGKDLNLVERRIAAVNPSDPLETTKPDMTLKEALKIAFGFNEPNGNLQYQGKDITEFDFNFDQQTSQNIKNQLAELNATNIYTVLDKIKLNAKMNILIRDKRFHYDRNNIAVGADESVVKEAHREVINSSTEGLLLNIDKDIRKILSGYIVEIEDTEGLKEVINDRYDMLNISSLRQDGKTFIDFKKYNDKLPLYISNPNYKVNVYAVTKENTIINPSENGDTSTNGIKKILIFSKKGYEIG		Q52NH4			7.8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9545588	Functional expression of a mammalian acetylcholinesterase in Pichia pastoris: comparison to acetylcholinesterase, expressed and reconstituted from Escherichia coli.	The mature rat brain acetylcholinesterase gene (T subunit, AChE) was subcloned downstream of the temperature-inducible lambda promoter PL and fused to the signal peptide of the OmpA protein. Three different expression vectors were constructed: (i) pCompmA containing the mature AChE, (ii) pComp delta TA containing a truncated AChE and (iii) pComp delta TAH containing the truncated AChE C-terminal fused to a 6xHis-tag. With all expression vectors the overexpression of AChE in Escherichia coli resulted mainly in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (IB). However, some activity was found in the periplasmic space. The inclusion bodies were refolded in vitro, yielding up to 1.42 U/mg IB of active AChE. The refolded AChE was partially purified (approx. 300-fold) by affinity chromatography with a specific activity of approx. 250 U/mg. Removing the cysteine residue near the C-terminus (truncated AChE, delta TAChE) assuming to affect the refolding, did not increase the amount of active enzyme obtained after refolding. Purification of denatured delta TAChE-6xHis prior to refolding by Ni-NTA-chromatography increased the refolding efficiency by a factor of 1.5. Functional expression and secretion of rat brain acetylcholinesterase into the medium was achieved in Pichia pastoris. By optimizing the culture conditions, 100 mU/ml AChE in the medium was produced. In this work we are describing the functional expression of a mammalian AChE in a microbial host in good yields for the first time. The physico-chemical properties of both, the bacterial and yeast expressed AChE were compared with those of the native AChE. The properties of the yeast expressed AChE and the native AChE were similar, whereas the E. coli expressed enzyme was found to be less stable and had different inhibition properties.	1998 Mar	Heim J,Schmidt-Dannert C,Atomi H,Schmid R D	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1396(3) 306-19	Acetylcholinesterase	MRPPWYPLHTPSLASPLLFLLLSLLGGGARAEGREDPQLLVRVRGGQLRGIRLKAPGGPVSAFLGIPFAEPPVGSRRFMPPEPKRPWSGILDATTFQNVCYQYVDTLYPGFEGTEMWNPNRELSEDCLYLNVWTPYPRPTSPTPVLIWIYGGGFYSGASSLDVYDGRFLAQVEGTVLVSMNYRVGTFGFLALPGSRDAPGNVGLLDQRLALQWVQENIAAFGGDPMSVTLFGESAGAASVGMHILSLPSRSLFHRAVLQSGTPNGPWATVSAGEARRRATLLARLVGCPPGGAGGNDTELISCLRTRPAQDLVDHEWHVLPQESIFRFSFVPVVDGDFLSDTPEALINTGDFQDLQVLVGVVKDEGSYFLVYGVPGFSKDNESLISRAQFLAGVRIGVPQASDLAAEAVVLHYTDWLHPEDPAHLRDAMSAVVGDHNVVCPVAQLAGRLAAQGARVYAYIFEHRASTLTWPLWMGVPHGYEIEFIFGLPLDPSLNYTVEERIFAQRLMKYWTNFARTGDPNDPRDSKSPRWPPYTTAAQQYVSLNLKPLEVRRGLRAQTCAFWNRFLPKLLSATDTLDEAERQWKAEFHRWSSYMVHWKNQFDHYSKQERCSDL	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q505J2			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14999015	Characterization of recombinant CEL-I, a GalNAc-specific C-type lectin, expressed in Escherichia coli using an artificial synthetic gene.	CEL-I is a C-type lectin isolated from the Holothuroidea Cucumaria echinata. This lectin shows very high N-acetylgalactosamine-binding specificity. We constructed an artificial gene encoding recombinant CEL-I (rCEL-I) using a combination of synthetic oligonucleotides, and expressed it in Escherichia coli cells. Since the recombinant protein was obtained as inclusion bodies, the latter were solubilized using urea and 2-mercaptoethanol, and the protein was refolded during the purification and dialysis steps. The purified rCEL-I showed comparable hemagglutinating activity to that of native CEL-I at relatively high Ca(2+)-concentrations, whereas it was weaker at lower Ca(2+)-concentrations due to decreased Ca(2+)-binding affinity. rCEL-I exhibited similar carbohydrate-binding specificity to native CEL-I, including strong GalNAc-binding specificity, as examined by hemagglutination inhibition assay. Comparison of the far UV-CD spectra of recombinant and native CEL-I revealed that the two proteins undergo a similar conformational change upon binding of Ca(2+). Single crystals of rCEL-I were also obtained under the same conditions as those used for the native protein, suggesting that they have similar tertiary structures. Although native CEL-I exhibited strong cytotoxicity toward cultured cells, rCEL-I showed low cytotoxicity. These results indicate that rCEL-I has a tertiary structure and carbohydrate-binding specificity similar to those of native CEL-I. Howeger, there is a subtle difference in the properties between the two proteins probably due to the additional methionine residue at the N-terminus of rCEL-I.	2004 Jan	Hatakeyama Tomomitsu,Shiba Kouhei,Matsuo Noriaki,Fujimoto Tokiko,Oda Tatsuya,Sugawara Hajime,Aoyagi Haruhiko	Journal of biochemistry. 135(1) 101-7	Lectin CEL-I, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-specific C-type	NQCPTDWEAEGDHCYRFFNTLTTWENAHHECVSYSCSTLNVRSDLVSVHSAAEQAYVFNYWRGIDSQAGQLWIGLYDKYNEGDFIWTDGSKVGYTKWAGGQPDNWNNAEDYGQFRHTEGGAWNDNSAAAQAKYMCKLTFE		Q7M462				0	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16159786	Characterization of a novel porin protein from Moraxella catarrhalis and identification of an immunodominant surface loop.	Moraxella catarrhalis is a gram-negative bacterium that is mainly responsible for respiratory tract infections. In this study we report a novel outer membrane protein (OMP), designated M35, with a molecular mass of 36.1 kDa. This protein was structurally homologous to classic gram-negative porins, such as OMP C from Escherichia coli and OMP K36 from Klebsiella pneumoniae, with a predicted structure of 8 surface loops and 16 antiparallel beta-sheets. The DNA sequences of the genes from 18 diverse clinical isolates showed that the gene was highly conserved (99.6 to 1000f nucleotides), with only one isolate (ID78LN266) having base variations that resulted in amino acid substitutions. Electrophoresis and analysis of recognition of the protein using mouse anti-M35 sera showed that M35 was expressed on the bacterial surface and constitutively expressed across M. catarrhalis isolates, with only ID78LN266 showing poor antibody recognition. Our results showed that the single amino acid mutation in loop 3 significantly affected antibody recognition, indicating that loop 3 appeared to contain an immunodominant B-cell epitope. The antibody specificity to loop 3 may be a potential mechanism for evasion of host immune responses targeted to M35, since loop 3 should theoretically orientate into the porin channel. Thus, M35 is a highly conserved, surface-expressed protein that is of significance for its potential functional role as an M. catarrhalis porin and is of interest as a vaccine candidate.	2005 Sep	Easton Donna M,Smith Adam,Gallego Sara Gomez,Foxwell A Ruth,Cripps Allan W,Kyd Jennelle M	Journal of bacteriology. 187(18) 6528-35	Outer membrane porin M35	MKKLALATAVAALSVSAAQATPTVYGKAFLTVDANNTDTTYNSGLVQLSEDTNESGLNSNTSRIGFKGSEALNANTDVVYQLEYKIDIDADRGDNFKSRDTYLGLAHKQYGTLLAGRLTTIDDSVDFASMLEDNNVADIGPTFNAPRANNAFAYVSPEYNGTQFLAMYAFDSDTDKGGLAKDDQFGVGATYSTGPINAGATYIHYGDDSHIRLSGNYAVSPALTVGALYQISEFGVAAKNQKASPLSEGKVGDKKENTLIVSGEMKTATPWTAYGQATLIKNVAGNDGDESVGVGIGGKYAFNKATTGHVYTGYVNSERKNVKYEGSNETHKNAHKDTKFDGYKNSGFGIGAGLEYKF	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q3MK87			6.9	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

The barley chloroplast psbA gene encoding D1 protein, one of the main photosystem II components, has been over-expressed in E. coli cells. The existance of two in vivo expression products, a protein with M(r) about 33.5 kDa, corresponding to the full-length precursor of the 32 kDa D1 mature form, and a truncated 29 kDa polypeptide was revealed. A modified D1 protein containing six histidine residues at the carboxy-terminus was also obtained. After isolation and renaturation, the ability of the recombinant D1 protein to bind atrazine and pigments from barley thylakoids was demonstrated.	1994 Jul	Efimov V A,Fradkov A F,Raskind A B,Khristin M S,Klimov V V,Chakhmakhcheva O G	FEBS letters. 348(2) 153-7	Photosystem Q(B) protein	TAILERRESTSLWGRFCNWITSTENRLYIGWFGVLMIPTLLTATSVFIIAFIAAPPVDIDGIREPVSGSLLYGNNIISGAIIPTSAAIGLHFYPIWEAASVDEWLYNGGPYELIVLHFLLGVACYMGREWELSFRLGMRPWIAVAYSAPVAAATAVFLIYPIGQGSFSDGMPLGISGTFNFMIVFQAEHNILMHPFHMLGVAGVFGGSLFSAMHGSLVTSSLIRETTENESANEGYKFGQEEETYNIVAAHGYFGRLIFQYASFNNSRSLHFFLAAWPVVGIWFTALGISTMAFNLNGFNFNQSVVDSQGRVINTWADIINRANLGMEVMHERNAHNFPLDLA		P05337			8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
2166816	Purification, renaturation, and reconstituted protein kinase activity of the Sendai virus large (L) protein: L protein phosphorylates the NP and P proteins in vitro.	Sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized Sendai virus large (L) protein was highly purified by a one-step procedure, using hydroxylapatite column chromatography. Monoclonal antibodies addressed to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequence of the L protein were used for monitoring L protein during purification. By removing sodium dodecyl sulfate from purified L protein, a protein kinase activity was successfully renatured. P and NP proteins served as its substrates. After immunoprecipitation with anti-L antibodies, the immunocomplex already showed protein kinase activity. In the presence of P protein, the NP protein was more highly phosphorylated. The results show that Sendai virus L protein possesses a protein kinase activity phosphorylating the other proteins of the viral nucleocapsid in vitro.	1990 Sep	Einberger H,Mertz R,Hofschneider P H,Neubert W J	Journal of virology. 64(9) 4274-80	Large structural protein	MDGQESSQNPSDILYPECHLNSPIVRGKIAQLHVLLDVNQPYRLKDDSIINITKHKIRNGGLSPRQIKIRSLGKALQRTIKDLDRYTFDPYPTYSQELLRLDIPEICDKIRSVFAVSDRLTRLSSGFQDLWLNIFKQLGNIEGREGYDPLQDISTIPEITDKYSRNRWYRPFLTWFSIKYDRWMQKTRPGGPLDTSNSHNLLECKSYTLVTYGDLVMILNKLTLTGYILTPELVLMYCDVVEGRWNMSAAGHLDKRSIGITSKGEELWELVDSLFSSLGEEIYNVIALLEPLSLALIQLNDPVIPLRGAFMRHVLTELQTVLTSRDVYTDAEADTIVESLLAIFHGTSIDEKAEIFSFFRTFGHPSLEAVTAADKVRAHMYAQKAIKLKTLYECHAVFCTIIINGYRERHGGQWPPCDFPDHVCLELRNAQGSNTAISYECAVDNYTSFIGFKFRKFIEPQLDEDLTIYMKDKALSPRKEAWDSVYPDSNLYYKAPESEETRRLIEVFINDENFNPEEIINYVESGDWLKDEKFNISYSLKEKEIKQEGRLFAKMTYKMRAVQVLAETLLAKGIGELFSENGMVKGEIDLLKRLTTLSVSGVPRTDSVYNNSKSSEKRNEGMKKKNSGGYWDEKKRSRHEFKATDSSTDGYETLSCFLTTDLKKYCLNWRFESTALFGQRCNEIFGFKTFFNWMHPVLERCTIYVGDPYCPVADRMHRQLQDHADSGIFIHNPRGGIEGYCQKLWTLISISAIHLAAVRVGVRVSAMVQGDNQAIAVTSRVPVAQTYKQKKNHVYEETTKYFGALRHVMFDVGHELKLNETIISSKMFVYSKRIYYDGKILPQCLKALTRCVFWSETLVDENRSACSNISTSIAKAIENGYSPILGYCIALYKTCQQVCISLGMTINPTISPTVRDQYFKGKNWLRCAVLIPANVGGFNYMSTSRCFVRNIGDPAVAALADLKRFIRADLLDKQVLYRVMNQEPGDSSFLDWASDPYSCNLPHSQSITTIIKNITARSVLQESPNPLLSGLFTETSGEEDLNLASFLMDRKVILPRVAHEILGNSLTGVREAIAGMLDTTKSLVRASVRKGGLSYGILRRLVNYDLLQYETLTRTLRKPVKDNIEYEYMCSVELAVGLRQKMWIHLTYGRPIHGLETPDPLELLRGTFIEGSEVCKLCRSEGADPIYTWFYLPDNIDLDTLTNGSPAIRIPYFGSATDERSEAQLGYVRNLSKPAKAAIRIAMVYTWAYGTDEISWMEAALIAQTRANLSLENLKLLTPVSTSTNLSHRLKDTATQMKFSSATLVRASRFITISNDNMALKEAGESKDTNLVYQQIMLTGLSLFEFNMRYKKGSLGKPLILHLHLNNGCCIMESPQEANIPPRSTLDLEITQENNKLIYDPDPLKDVDLELFSKVRDVVHTVDMTYWSDDEVIRATSICTAMTIADTMSQLDRDNLKEMIALVNDDDVNSLITEFMVIDVPLFCSTFGGILVNQFAYSLYGLNIRGREEIWGHVVRILKDTSHAVLKVLSNALSHPKIFKRFWNAGVVEPVYGPNLSNQDKILLALSVCEYSVDLFMHDWQGGVPLEIFICDNDPDVADMRRSSFLARHLAYLCSLAEISRDGPRLESMNSLERLESLKSYLELTFLDDPVLRYSQLTGLVIKVFPSTLTYIRKSSIKVLRTRGIGVPEVLEDWDPEADNALLDGIAAEIQQNIPLGHQTRAPFWGLRVSKSQVLRLRGYKEITRGEIGRSGVGLTLPFDGRYLSHQLRLFGINSTSCLKALELTYLLSPLVDKDKDRLYLGEGAGAMLSCYDATLGPCINYYNSGVYSCDVNGQRELNIYPAEVALVGKKLNNVTSLGQRVKVLFNGNPGSTWIGNDECEALIWNELQNSSIGLVHCDMEGGDHKDDQVVLHEHYSVIRIAYLVGDRDVVLISKIAPRLGTDWTRQLSLYLRYWDEVNLIVLKTSNPASTEMYLLSRHPKSDIIEDSKTVLASLLPLSKEDSIKIEKWILIEKAKAHEWVTRELREGSSSSGMLRPYHQALQTFGFEPNLYKLSRDFLSTMNIADTHNCMIAFNRVLQDTIFEWARITESDKRLKLTGKYDLYPVRDSGKLKTISRRLVLSWISLSMSTRLVTGSFPDQKFEARLQLGIVSLSSREIRNLRVITKTLLDRFEDIIHSITYRFLTKEIKILMKILGAVKMFGASQNEYTTVIDDGSLGDIEPYDSS		Q06996			8.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

15930001	Structural model of the amino propeptide of collagen XI alpha1 chain with similarity to the LNS domains.	Fibrillar collagens are the principal structural molecules of connective tissues. The assembly of collagen fibrils is regulated by quantitatively minor fibrillar collagens, types V and XI. A unique amino-terminal propeptide domain of these collagens has been attributed this regulatory role. The structure of the amino terminal propeptide has yet to be determined. Low sequence similarity necessitated a secondary structure-based method to carry out homology modeling based upon the determined structure of LNS family members, named for a common structure in the laminin LG5 domain, the neurexin 1B domain and the sex hormone binding globulin. Distribution of amino acids within the model suggested glycosaminoglycan interaction and calcium binding. These activities were tested experimentally. Sequence analyses of existing genes for collagens indicate that 16 known collagen alpha chains may contain an LNS domain. A similar approach may prove useful for structure/function studies of similar domains in other collagens with similar domains. This will provide mechanistic details of the organization and assembly of the extracellular matrix and the underlying basis of structural integrity in connective tissues. The absolute requirement for collagen XI in skeletal growth is indicated by collagen XI deficiencies such as chondrodystrophies found in the cho/cho mouse and in humans with Stickler syndrome.	2005 Jun	Fallahi Arzhang,Kroll Becky,Warner Lisa R,Oxford Rex J,Irwin Katey M,Mercer Linda M,Shadle Susan E,Oxford Julia Thom	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 14(6) 1526-37	Type XI collagen alpha-1 chain	APVDILKALDFHNSPVGISKTTGFCTSRKNSKDPDIAYRVTEEAQISAPTKQLFPGGIFPQDFSILFTIKPKKGTQAFLLSLYNEHGIQQLGVEVGRSPVFLFEDHTGKPTPENYPLFSTVNIADGKWHRVAISVEKKTVTMIVDCKKKITKPLDRSERSIVDTNGIMVFGTRILETDVFQGDIQQFLITGDPKAAYDYCDHYSPDCDLTSKAAQAQEPHIDEKKKSNYTKKKRTLATNSKKKSKMSTTPKSEKFASKKKKRNQATAKAKLGVQANIVDDFQDYNYGTMETYQTESPRRVSGSNEPNPVEEGFTEEYLTGEDYDVQRNISEDILYGNKGIDGRDSDLLVDGDLGEYDFYEYKEYEERTTTAPNEEFGPGVPAETDFTETSINGHGAYGEKGQKGEPAVVEPGMLVEGPPGPAGPAGLMGPPGLQGPSGLPGDPGDRGPPGRPGLPGADGLPGPPGTMLMLPFRYGGDGSKGPTISAQEAQAQAILQQARIALRGPPGPMGLTGRPGPVGGPGSAGAKGESGDP		Q8VBY8				0	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
16332198	Preparation and characterization of a monoclonal antibody against the protein LIGHT.	LIGHT (which is homologous to lymphotoxins, shows inducible expression, and competes with HSV glycoprotein D for HVEM, a receptor expressed by T lymphocytes [Genome Database designation, TNFSF14]), a newly identified member of the TNF superfamily, is up-regulated upon activation of T-cells. LIGHT plays an important role in the T-cell-mediated tumor and graft-versus-host disease via LIGHT/HVEM/LT beta R signaling. To prepare specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) against murine LIGHT, a fragment containing the extracellular domain of LIGHT was inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a(+). The his-tagged fusion protein was expressed in BL21(DE3) in the form of inclusion bodies. The fusion protein was purified and refolded on-column using immobilized mental affinity chromatography. Rat MAb against murine LIGHT was obtained with hybridoma technique and specific ELISA screening. Western blotting and flow cytometry assays showed that MAb 4C11 had specific binding ability with LIGHT protein in eukaryotic cells. Lymphocyte proliferation assays indicated that this MAb could co-stimulate the proliferation of T-cells. Thus, this MAb may be the basis for detection of LIGHT protein in tissue or cell and be beneficial for the study of LIGHT/HVEM/LT beta R pathway.	2005 Dec	Fan Kexing,Zhou Qian,Wang Hao,Guo Yajun	Hybridoma (2005). 24(6) 309-13	Monoclonal anti-idiotypic Schistosoma japonicum antibody NP30 immunoglobulin lig	ENLLTQSPAIMSASPGEKVTMTCSASSSVSYVYWYLQKPGSSPRLLIYDTSNLASGVPVRFSGSGSGTSYSLTISRMEAEDAATYYCQQWTSYPFTFGSGTKLELK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9U410			8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The expression cassette polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a DNA fragment encoding the pheromone binding protein (PBP) of the male moth Antheraea polyphemus. Transformation of Escherichia coli cells with a vector containing this construct generated clones which, when induced with isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, produced the 14-kDa PBP in both the soluble fraction and in inclusion bodies. Purification of the soluble recombinant PBP by preparative isoelectric focusing and gel filtration gave &gt; 950mogeneous protein, which was immunoreactive with an anti-PBP antiserum and exhibited specific, pheromone-displaceable covalent modification by the photoaffinity label [3H]6E,11Z-hexadecadienyl diazoacetate. Recombinant PBP was indistinguishable from the insect-derived PBP, as determined by both native and denaturing gel electrophoresis, immunoreactivity, and photoaffinity labeling properties. Moreover, the insoluble inclusion body protein could be solubilized, refolded, and purified by the same procedures to give a recombinant PBP indistinguishable from the soluble PBP. Proton NMR spectra of the soluble and refolded protein provide further evidence that they possess the same folded structure.	1993 Mar	Prestwich G D	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 2(3) 420-8	Pheromone-binding protein	SPEIMKNLSNNFGKAMDQCKDELSLPDSVVADLYNFWKDDYVMTDRLAGCAINCLATKLDVVDPDGNLHHGNAKDFAMKHGADETMAQQLVDIIHGCEKSAPPNDDKCMKTIDVAMCFKKEIHKLNWVPNMDLVIGEVLAEV		P20797			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

Recombinant PBP was indistinguishable from the insect-derived PBP, as determined by both native and denaturing gel electrophoresis, immunoreactivity, and photoaffinity labeling properties. Moreover, the insoluble inclusion body protein could be solubilized, refolded, and purified by the same procedures to give a recombinant PBP indistinguishable from the soluble PBP. Proton NMR spectra of the soluble and refolded protein provide further evidence that they possess the same folded structure.	1993 Mar	Prestwich G D	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 2(3) 420-8	Pheromone-binding protein	SPEIMKNLSNNFGKAMDQCKDELSLPDSVVADLYNFWKDDYVMTDRLAGCAINCLATKLDVVDPDGNLHHGNAKDFAMKHGADETMAQQLVDIIHGCEKSAPPNDDKCMKTIDVAMCFKKEIHKLNWVPNMDLVIGEVLAEV		P20797			5.6	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9219366	Expression and characterization of a lepidopteran general odorant binding protein.	Olfaction in months involves the transport of volatile, hydrophobic odorant molecules through the aqueous interior of the antennal sensory hairs by soluble odorant binding proteins. Two subfamilies of the 17 kDa general odorant binding proteins, GOBP1 and GOBP2, are 47-57 0dentical to each other and 21-570 the pheromone binding proteins (PBPs); identity within a GOBP subfamily exceeds 78 0n all lepidopteran species examined. However, the ligands for GOBPs are unknown. In order to investigate odorant specificities of GOBPs, recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using PCR-prepared expression cassettes based on the cDNA sequences of GOBP1 and GOBP2 from Manduca sexta. Both soluble and insoluble recombinant GOBPs (rGOBPs) were obtained, and the inclusion body GOBPs were solubilized, refolded and purified. The soluble and refolded rGOBPs were purified by preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF), gel filtration, and finally by ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Only rGOBP2, but not rGOBP1, was crossreactive with an anti-GOBP2 (Antheraea polyphemus) antiserum. rGOBP2, but not rGOBP1, could be photoaffinity labelled by the diazoacetate pheromone analog [3H]-6E, 11Z, 16:Dza. For rGOBP2, plant odors such as (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol (3Z-6:OH), geraniol, geranyl acetate, and limonene showed significant competition for binding; binding specificity was sensitive to pH and to salt concentrations. Circular dichroism (CD) confirms that, as with the pheromone binding proteins, GOBP2 is predominantly alpha-helical. Although the characterization of rGOBP1 has resisted analysis, rGOBP2 is readily prepared and studied. We suggest that GOBP2 may be broadly tuned to a class of &quot;green&quot; and floral odors.	1997 May	Feng L,Prestwich G D	Insect biochemistry and molecular biology. 27(5) 405-12	General odorant-binding protein 1	DVQVMKDVTLGFGQALEQCREESQLTEEKMEEFFHFWREDFKFEHRELGCALQCMSRHFNLLTDSSRMHHENTDKFIKSFPNGAVLSKTMVELIHNCELQHDAEEDHCWRILRVAECFKISCTKAGIAPSMEVMMAEFIMELKQ		P31418			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

16256161	Immunization with a single extracellular enveloped virus protein produced in bacteria provides partial protection from a lethal orthopoxvirus infection in a natural host.	Subunit vaccines that use the vaccinia virus extracellular envelope protein A33R alone or combined with other structural proteins are excellent candidates for a new smallpox vaccine. Since a new smallpox vaccine would be used in humans, who are the natural hosts for the Orthopoxvirus variola, the agent of smallpox, it would be important to determine whether a prospective smallpox vaccine can protect from a lethal Orthopoxvirus infection in a natural host.

15862351	High-level expression and immunogenic properties of the recombinant rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus VP60 capsid protein obtained in Pichia pastoris.	The VP60 capsid protein from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) (Spanish isolate AST/89) was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The transformed yeast was grown at high cell density and an expression level of about 1.5 g VP60L(-1) culture was obtained. The protein was detected associated with the cell debris fraction of the recombinant yeast after mechanical disruption. It was purified by a simple method and was obtained N-glycosylated with purity of approximately 70% as deduced from densitometry scan analysis. The recombinant product was antigenically similar to the native capsid protein as determined with polyclonal antibodies obtained from rabbits vaccinated with VP60 protein purified from native virus. The immunogenicity of VP60 protein purified from P. pastoris was demonstrated by ELISA in a vaccination experiment conducted with two groups of rabbits subcutaneously immunized. Animals vaccinated with VP60 in Freund&#39;s incomplete adjuvant developed a significant (p&lt;0.01) virus-specific antibody response while the group injected with placebo remained seronegative. Preliminary results showed that the antigen administered within the cell debris fraction of the transformed yeast protected rabbits immunized by the oral route against an intramuscular challenge with 100 LD50 (16,000 hemagglutination units) of homologous virus.	2005 May	Farnós Omar,Boué Oscar,Parra Francisco,Martín-Alonso José Manuel,Valdés Odaysa,Joglar Marisdania,Navea Leonor,Naranjo Paula,Lleonart Ricardo	Journal of biotechnology. 117(3) 215-24	Capsid protein VP60	MEGKARTAPQGEAAGTATTASVPGTTTDGMDPGVVAATSVVTAENSSASVATAGIGGPPQQVDQQETWRTNFYYNDVFTWSVADAPGSILYTVQHSPQNNPFTAVLSQMYAGWAGGMQFRFIVAGSGVFGGRLVAAVIPPGIEIGPGLEVRQFPHVVIDARSLEPVTITMPDLRPNMYHPTGDPGLVPTLVLSVYNNLINPFGGSTNAIQVTVETRPSDDFEFVMIRAPSSKTVDSISPAGLLTTPVLTGVGNDNRWNGQIVGLQPVPGGFSTCNRHWNLNGSTYGWSSPRFADIDHRRGSASYSGNNATNVLQFWYANAGSAIDNPISKVAPDGFPDMSFVPFNSPNIPAAGWVGFGGIWNSNNGAPAATTVQAYELGFATGAPNNLQPTTNTSGAQTVAKSIYAVVTGTNQNPTGLFVMASGVISTPNANAVTYTPQPDRIVTTPGTPAAAPVGKNSPIMFASVVRRTGDVNAAAGSTNGTQYGTGSQPLPVTIGLSLNNYSSALMPGQFFVWQLTFASGFMEIGLSVDGYFYAGTGASTTLIDLTELIDVRPVGPRPSKSTLVFNLGGTANGFSYV		Q80BA9			10	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
11005928	Construction and structural modeling of a single-chain Fv-asparaginase fusion protein resistant to proteolysis.	In this study, we construct a fusion protein composed of L-asparaginase (ASNase; from Escherichia coli AS 1.357) and a protective single-chain Fv (scFv), which was selected from a phage-display scFv library from our previous studies. The antibody moiety of the fusion protein was fused to the N-terminus of the enzyme moiety via a linker peptide, (Gly(4)Ser)(6). Recombinant plasmid pET-SLA was constructed to express scFv-ASNase fusion to high levels in E. coli and the expressed product was found to form inclusion bodies. We obtained a soluble fusion protein by refolding and purification. The soluble fusion protein exhibited about 820f the enzymatic activity of the native ASNase at the same molar concentration, and had a K(m) value similar to that of the native enzyme for the substrate L-asparagine. Importantly, the fusion protein was more stable than native ASNase. In addition: (1) following treatment with trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and rennet, at 37 degrees C for 30 min, scFv-ASNase fusion retained 94.0%, 88.8%, and 84.50f its original activity, respectively, whereas native ASNase became inactive; and (2) ScFv-ASNase fusion had a much longer in vitro half-life (9 h) in serum than the native enzyme (2 h). The three-dimensional structure of the fusion protein was obtained by modeling with the Homology and Discover modules of the INSIGHT II software package. On the basis of the structural evidence and biochemical properties, we propose that the scFv moiety of the fusion protein may confer ASNase moiety resistance to proteolysis as a result of both steric hindrance and a change in the electrostatic surface of the enzyme.	2000 Nov	Guo L,Wang J,Qian S,Yan X,Chen R,Meng G	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 70(4) 456-63	Single-chain FV-Asparaginase Fusion protein	MAQVQLVQSGAEVKKPGASVKVSCKASGYTFTSYAMHWVRQAPGQRLEWMGWINAGNGNTKYSQKFQGRVTITRDTSASTAYMELSSLRSEDTAVYYCARLTPNKFKSRGHWGQGTLVTVSRGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSSELTQDPAVSVALGQTVRITCQGDSLRSYYASWYQQKPGQAPVLVIYGKNNRPSGIPDRFSGSSSGNTASLTITGAQAEDEADYYCNSRDSSGNHVVFGGGTKLTVLGAAAEQKLISEEDLNGAAMAQVQLVQSGAEVKKPGASVKVSCKASGYTFTSYAMHWVRQAPGQRLEWMGWINAGNGNTKYSQKFQGRVTITRDTSASTAYMELSSLRSEDTAVYYCARLTPNKFKSRGHWGQGTLVTVSRGGGGSGGGGSGGGGSSELTQDPAVSVALGQTVRITCQGDSLRSYYASWYQQKPGQAPVLVIYGKNNRPSGIPDRFSGSSSGNTASLTITGAQAEDEADYYCNSRDSSGNHVVFGGGTKLTVLGAAAEQKLISEEDLNGAA	The full sequence is the sequence of scFv (BAA82041 from NCBI) and ASNase (A8A499) 	A8A499			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15003254	Reconstitution of an E box-binding Myc:Max complex with recombinant full-length proteins expressed in Escherichia coli.	The c-Myc oncoprotein (Myc) is a DNA sequence-specific transcription factor that regulates transcription of a wide variety of genes involved in the control of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and its deregulated expression is implicated in many types of human cancer. Myc has an N-terminal transcription activation domain (TAD) that interacts with various coactivators and a C-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHZip) domain required for E box-specific DNA-binding and heterodimerization with its obligatory bHLHZip protein partner Max. The analysis of the mechanisms by which the Myc:Max complex regulates transcription at the molecular level in vitro has been hampered by the difficulty in obtaining highly pure recombinant Myc:Max heterodimers that contain full-length Myc with its complete TAD domain and that have sequence-specific DNA-binding activity. Here, we describe a simple method to reconstitute recombinant Myc:Max complexes from highly purified full-length proteins expressed in Escherichia coli that are soluble and highly active in E box-specific DNA-binding in vitro. The reconstituted Myc:Max complexes are stable and lack Max:Max homodimers. This procedure should facilitate the characterization of the DNA-binding and transcription activation functions of full-length Myc:Max complexes in vitro and in particular the role of Myc TAD-interacting cofactors and Myc:Max post-translational modifications.	2004 Apr	Farina Anthony,Faiola Francesco,Martinez Ernest	Protein expression and purification. 34(2) 215-22	Myc proto-oncogene protein	MPLNVSFTNRNYDLDYDSVQPYFYCDEEENFYQQQQQSELQPPAPSEDIWKKFELLPTPPLSPSRRSGLCSPSYVAVTPFSLRGDNDGGGGSFSTADQLEMVTELLGGDMVNQSFICDPDDETFIKNIIIQDCMWSGFSAAAKLVSEKLASYQAARKDSGSPNPARGHSVCSTSSLYLQDLSAAASECIDPSVVFPYPLNDSSSPKSCASQDSSAFSPSSDSLLSSTESSPQGSPEPLVLHEETPPTTSSDSEEEQEDEEEIDVVSVEKRQAPGKRSESGSPSAGGHSKPPHSPLVLKRCHVSTHQHNYAAPPSTRKDYPAAKRVKLDSVRVLRQISNNRKCTSPRSSDTEENVKRRTHNVLERQRRNELKRSFFALRDQIPELENNEKAPKVVILKKATAYILSVQAEEQKLISEEDLLRKRREQLKHKLEQLRNSCA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P01106				25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10806386	Interaction between the lipoamide-containing H-protein and the lipoamide dehydrogenase (L-protein) of the glycine decarboxylase multienzyme system 2. Crystal structures of H- and L-proteins.	The glycine decarboxylase complex consists of four different component enzymes (P-, H-, T- and L-proteins). The 14-kDa lipoamide-containing H-protein plays a pivotal role in the complete sequence of reactions as its prosthetic group (lipoic acid) interacts successively with the three other components of the complex and undergoes a cycle of reductive methylamination, methylamine transfer and electron transfer. With the aim to understand the interaction between the H-protein and its different partners, we have previously determined the crystal structure of the oxidized and methylaminated forms of the H-protein. In the present study, we have crystallized the H-protein in its reduced state and the L-protein (lipoamide dehydrogenase or dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase). The L-protein has been overexpressed in Escherichia coli and refolded from inclusion bodies in an active form. Crystals were obtained from the refolded L-protein and the structure has been determined by X-ray crystallography. This first crystal structure of a plant dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase is similar to other known dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase structures. The crystal structure of the H-protein in its reduced form has been determined and compared to the structure of the other forms of the protein. It is isomorphous to the structure of the oxidized form. In contrast with methylaminated H-protein where the loaded lipoamide arm was locked into a cavity of the protein, the reduced lipoamide arm appeared freely exposed to the solvent. Such a freedom is required to allow its targeting inside the hollow active site of L-protein. Our results strongly suggest that a direct interaction between the H- and L-proteins is not necessary for the reoxidation of the reduced lipoamide arm bound to the H-protein. This hypothesis is supported by biochemical data [Neuburger, M., Polidori, A.M., Piètre, E., Faure, M., Jourdain, A., Bourguignon, J., Pucci, B. &amp; Douce, R. (2000) Eur. J.

1661668	The ORFa protein, the putative transposase of maize transposable element Ac, has a basic DNA binding domain.	Ac encodes the 807 amino acid ORFa protein which binds specifically to multiple AAACGG motifs that are subterminally located in both ends of Ac. The wild-type ORFa protein and a number of deletion and amino acid exchange mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, renatured and used for mobility shift assays. At least 136 amino acids from the N-terminus and 537 C-terminal amino acids may be removed from the ORFa protein without destroying the DNA binding domain, whereas a protein starting at amino acid 189 is DNA binding deficient. Certain basic amino acids between positions 190 and 200 are essential for DNA binding, as their substitution with uncharged amino acids leads to the loss of this function. The DNA binding domain of ORFa protein has an overall basic character, but no obvious sequence homology to any other known DNA binding protein. The homologies to the major open reading frames of transposable elements Tam3 from Antirrhinum majus and Hobo from Drosophila are found between the C-terminal two thirds of the three proteins. The ORFa protein forms discrete complexes with target DNA that appear, depending on the protein concentration, as a &#39;ladder&#39; of bands on gels, indicating the occupation of target DNA by multiple ORFa protein molecules.	1991 Dec	Feldmar S,Kunze R	The EMBO journal. 10(13) 4003-10	Putative AC transposase	TPPVGNNPPSGSAIRLAKLMSTTRAPSTRKTNSVFSAYAQGLKRKAEASSSRIQNVRARARGHGCGRTSPSSSTAEAERHFIQSVSSSNANGTATDPSQDDMAIVHEPQPQPQPQPEPQPQPQPEPEEEAPQKRAKKCTSDVWQHFTKKEIEVEVDGKKYVQVWGHCNFPNCKAKYRAEGHHGTSGFRNHLRTSHSLVKGQLCLKSEKDHGKDINLIEPYKYDEVVSLKKLHLAIIMHEYPFNIVEHEYFVEFVKSLRPHFPIKSRVTARKYIMDLYLEEKEKLYGKLKDVQSRFSTTMDMWTSCQNKSYMCVTIHWIDDDWCLQKRIVGFFHVEGRHTGQRLSQTFTAIMVKWNIEKKLFALSLDNASANEVAVHDIIEDLQDTDSNLVCDGAFFHVRCACHILNLVAKDGLAVIAGTIEKIKAIVLAVKSSPLQWEELMKCASECDLDKSKGISYDVSTRWNSTYLMLRDALYYKPALIRLKTSDPRRYDAICPKAEEWKMALTLFKCLKKFFDLTELLSGTQYSTANLFYKGFCEIKDLIDQWCVHEKFVIRRMAVAMSEKFEKYWKVSNIALAVACFLDPRYKKILIEFYMKKFHGDSYKVHVDDFVRVIRKLYQFYSSCSPSAPKTKTTTNDSMDDTLMENEDDEFQNYLHELKDYDQVESNELDKYMSEPLLKHSGQFDILSWWRGRVAEYPILTQIARDVLAIQVSTVASESAFSAGGRVVDPYRNRLGSEIVEALICTKDWVAASRKGATYFPTMIGDLEVLDSVIAAATNHENHMDEDEDAIEFSKNNEDVASGSSP		P08770			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15964019	Structure and inter-domain interactions of domain II from the blood-stage malarial protein, apical membrane antigen 1.	The malarial surface antigen apical membrane antigen (AMA1), from Plasmodium falciparum, is a leading candidate for inclusion in a vaccine against malaria. AMA1 is synthesised by mature blood-stages of the parasite and is located initially in the apical organelles of the merozoite. Prior to merozoite invasion of host erythrocytes, it is processed into a 66 kDa type 1 integral membrane protein on the merozoite surface. The pattern of disulphide bonds in AMA1 has been the basis for separation of the ectodomain into three domains, with three, two and three disulphide bonds, respectively. We have determined the solution structure of a 16kDa construct corresponding to the putative second domain of AMA1. While circular dichroism and hydrodynamic data were consistent with a folded structure for domain II, its NMR spectra were characterised by broad lines and significant peak overlap, more typical of a molten globule. Consistent with this, domain II bound the fluorescent dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulphonate (ANS). We have nonetheless determined a structure, which defines the secondary structure elements and global fold. The two disulphide bonds link the N and C-terminal regions of the molecule, which come together to form a four-stranded beta-sheet linked to a short helix. A long loop linking the N and C-terminal regions contains four other alpha-helices, the locations of which are not fixed relative to the beta-sheet core, even though they are well-defined locally. Very recently this region of domain II has been shown to contain the epitope recognised by the invasion-inhibitory antibody 4G2, even though it does not contain any of the polymorphisms that are regarded as having arisen in response to the pressure of immune recognition.	2005 Jul	Feng Zhi-Ping,Keizer David W,Stevenson Rachel A,Yao Shenggen,Babon Jeffrey J,Murphy Vince J,Anders Robin F,Norton Raymond S	Journal of molecular biology. 350(4) 641-56	Apical membrane antigen 1	AKFGLWVDGNCEDIPHVNEFPAIDLFECNKLVFELSASDQPKQYEQHLTDYEKIKEGFKNKNASMIKSAFLPTGAFKADRYKSHGRGYNWGNYNTKTQKCEIFNVKPTCLINNSSYIATTALSHPIE		A3F8A6		AMA1 domain II		0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16023209	Binding of natural variants of staphylococcal superantigens SEG and SEI to TCR and MHC class II molecule.	SEG and SEI are staphylococcal superantigens (SAgs) identified recently that belong to the egc operon and whose genes are in tandem orientation. Only a few allelic variants of SEG and SEI have been reported. Here we analyzed four Staphylococcus aureus strains with genotypic variation in both SAgs. However, both SAgs retain key residues in their putative TCR and MHC binding sites and, accordingly, their superantigenic properties. Thus, SEI significantly stimulates mouse T-cells bearing Vbeta3, 5 and 13, while SEG stimulates Vbeta7 and 9 in the draining node when inoculated in the footpad. As another member of the SEB subfamily, SEG also stimulates mouse Vbeta8.1+2. However, the increase in Vbeta8.1+2 T-cells observed at day 2 after inoculation reverts to normal values at day 4, whereas it remains high at day 4 following inoculation with SEC3 or SSA. T-cell stimulation assays in the mouse and analysis of the putative Vbeta8.2 binding site on SEG, which includes three non-conserved residues, suggest a possibly unique interaction between Vbeta8.2 and SEG. We also analyzed biochemical and biophysical characteristics of SEI and SEG binding to their cognate human beta chains by surface plasmon resonance, and binding to the HLA-DR1 MHC class II molecule by gel filtration. SEI binds human Vbeta5.2 and Vbeta1 with apparent K(D)&#39;s of 23 and 118 microM, respectively; SEG binds Vbeta13.6 with a K(D) of 5 microM. As suggested by sequence homology, SEI requires Zn2+ for strong binding to DR1, which goes undetected in the presence of EDTA. SEG and SEI have characteristics such as co-expression, different interaction with MHC class II and stimulation of completely different subsets of human and mouse T-cells, which indicate complementary superantigenic activity and suggest an important advantage to staphylococcal strains in producing them both.	2006 Mar	Fernández Marisa M,De Marzi Mauricio C,Berguer Paula,Burzyn Dalia,Langley Ries J,Piazzon Isabel,Mariuzza Roy A,Malchiodi Emilio L	Molecular immunology. 43(7) 927-38	HLA class II histocompatibility antigen, DR alpha chain	IKEEHVIIQAEFYLNPDQSGEFMFDFDGDEIFHVDMAKKETVWRLEEFGRFASFEAQGALANIAVDKANLEIMTKRSNYTPITNVPPEVTVLTNSPVELREPNVLICFIDKFTPPVVNVTWLRNGKPVTTGVSETVFLPREDHLFRKFHYLPFLPSTEDVYDCRVEHWGLDEPLLKHWEFDAPSPLPETTENVVCALGLTVGLVGIIIGTIFIIKGVRKSNAAERRGPL		P01903			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12667608	A single surface tryptophan in the chitin-binding domain from Bacillus circulans chitinase A1 plays a pivotal role in binding chitin and can be modified to create an elutable affinity tag.	Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to investigate the roles of a number of highly conserved residues of the chitin-binding domain (ChBD) of Bacillus circulans chitinase A1 (ChiA1) in the binding of chitin. Analysis of single alanine replacement mutants showed that mutation of an exposed tryptophan residue (Trp(687)) impaired the binding to chitin, while mutation of other highly conserved residues, most carrying aromatic or hydrophobic side chains, did not significantly affect the binding activity. Interestingly, replacement of Trp(687) with phenylalanine significantly reduced chitin-binding activity at lower salt concentrations (0-1 M NaCl) but allowed strong binding to chitin at 2 M NaCl. Since Trp(687) is conserved among the ChBDs belonging to the bacterial ChiA1 subfamily, the data presented suggest a general mechanism in which this exposed tryptophan, which is located in the cleft formed between two beta-sheets as revealed by the solution structure [J. Biol. Chem. 275 (2000) 13654], makes a major contribution to ligand binding presumably through hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, modulation of the chitin-binding activity by the conserved amino acid replacement (W687F) and a shift in the ionic strength of buffer has led to the development of an elutable affinity tag for single column purification of recombinant proteins.	2003 Apr	Ferrandon Sébastien,Sterzenbach Torsten,Mersha Fana B,Xu Ming-Qun	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1621(1) 31-40	Chitinase A1	WQVNTAYTAGQLVTYNGKTYKCLQPHTSLAGWEPSNVPALWQLQ		P20533		Chitin-binding domain (CHBD)	8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15964019	Structure and inter-domain interactions of domain II from the blood-stage malarial protein, apical membrane antigen 1.	The malarial surface antigen apical membrane antigen (AMA1), from Plasmodium falciparum, is a leading candidate for inclusion in a vaccine against malaria. AMA1 is synthesised by mature blood-stages of the parasite and is located initially in the apical organelles of the merozoite. Prior to merozoite invasion of host erythrocytes, it is processed into a 66 kDa type 1 integral membrane protein on the merozoite surface. The pattern of disulphide bonds in AMA1 has been the basis for separation of the ectodomain into three domains, with three, two and three disulphide bonds, respectively. We have determined the solution structure of a 16kDa construct corresponding to the putative second domain of AMA1. While circular dichroism and hydrodynamic data were consistent with a folded structure for domain II, its NMR spectra were characterised by broad lines and significant peak overlap, more typical of a molten globule. Consistent with this, domain II bound the fluorescent dye 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulphonate (ANS). We have nonetheless determined a structure, which defines the secondary structure elements and global fold. The two disulphide bonds link the N and C-terminal regions of the molecule, which come together to form a four-stranded beta-sheet linked to a short helix. A long loop linking the N and C-terminal regions contains four other alpha-helices, the locations of which are not fixed relative to the beta-sheet core, even though they are well-defined locally. Very recently this region of domain II has been shown to contain the epitope recognised by the invasion-inhibitory antibody 4G2, even though it does not contain any of the polymorphisms that are regarded as having arisen in response to the pressure of immune recognition.	2005 Jul	Feng Zhi-Ping,Keizer David W,Stevenson Rachel A,Yao Shenggen,Babon Jeffrey J,Murphy Vince J,Anders Robin F,Norton Raymond S	Journal of molecular biology. 350(4) 641-56	Apical membrane antigen 1	AKFGLWVDGNCEDIPHVNEFPAIDLFECNKLVFELSASDQPKQYEQHLTDYEKIKEGFKNKNASMIKSAFLPTGAFKADRYKSHGRGYNWGNYNTKTQKCEIFNVKPTCLINNSSYIATTALSHPIE		A3F8A6		AMA1 domain II		0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15767257	Molecular determinants of TRIF proteolysis mediated by the hepatitis C virus NS3/4A protease.	Persistent infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV) are a major cause of liver disease and reflect its ability to disrupt virus-induced signaling pathways activating cellular antiviral defenses. HCV evasion of double-stranded RNA signaling through Toll-like receptor 3 is mediated by the viral protease NS3/4A, which directs proteolysis of its proline-rich adaptor protein, Toll-IL-1 receptor domain containing adaptor-inducing interferon-beta (TRIF). The TRIF cleavage site has remarkable homology with the viral NS4B/5A substrate, although an 8-residue polyproline track extends upstream from the P(6) position in lieu of the acidic residue present in viral substrates. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy confirmed that a substantial fraction of TRIF exists as polyproline II helices, and inclusion of the polyproline track increased affinity of P side TRIF peptides for the HCV-BK protease. A polyproline II peptide representing an SH3 binding motif (PPPVPPRRR, Sos) bound NS3 with moderate affinity, resulting in inhibition of proteolytic activity. Chemical shift perturbations in NMR spectra indicated that Sos binds a 3(10) helix close to the protease active site. Thus, a polyproline II interaction with the 3(10) helix likely facilitates NS3/4A recognition of TRIF, indicating a significant difference from NS3/4A recognition of viral substrates. Because SH3 binding motifs are also present in NS5A, a viral protein that interacts with NS3, we speculate that the NS3 3(10) helix may be a site of interaction with other viral proteins.	2005 May	Ferreon Josephine C,Ferreon Allan Chris M,Li Kui,Lemon Stanley M	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(21) 20483-92	Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain-containing adapter protein inducing interferon	MACTGPSLPSAFDILGAAGQDKLLYLKHKLKTPRPGCQGQDLLHAMVLLKLGQETEARISLEALKADAVARLVARQWAGVDSTEDPEEPPDVSWAVARLYHLLAEEKLCPASLRDVAYQEAVRTLSSRDDHRLGELQDEARNRCGWDIAGDPGSIRTLQSNLGCLPPSSALPSGTRSLPRPIDGVSDWSQGCSLRSTGSPASLASNLEISQSPTMPFLSLHRSPHGPSKLCDDPQASLVPEPVPGGCQEPEEMSWPPSGEIASPPELPSSPPPGLPEVAPDATSTGLPDTPAAPETSTNYPVECTEGSAGPQSLPLPILEPVKNPCSVKDQTPLQLSVEDTTSPNTKPCPPTPTTPETSPPPPPPPPSSTPCSAHLTPSSLFPSSLESSSEQKFYNFVILHARADEHIALRVREKLEALGVPDGATFCEDFQVPGRGELSCLQDAIDHSAFIILLLTSNFDCRLSLHQVNQAMMSNLTRQGSPDCVIPFLPLESSPAQLSSDTASLLSGLVRLDEHSQIFARKVANTFKPHRLQARKAMWRKEQDTRALREQSQHLDGERMQAAALNAAYSAYLQSYLSYQAQMEQLQVAFGSHMSFGTGAPYGARMPFGGQVPLGAPPPFPTWPGCPQPPPLHAWQAGTPPPPSPQPAAFPQSLPFPQSPAFPTASPAPPQSPGLQPLIIHHAQMVQLGLNNHMWNQRGSQAPEDKTQEAE	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8IUC6			7.5	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
16046630	A novel system for continuous protein refolding and on-line capture by expanded bed adsorption.	A novel two-step protein refolding strategy has been developed, where continuous renaturation-bydilution is followed by direct capture on an expanded bed adsorption (EBA) column. The performance of the overall process was tested on a N-terminally tagged version of human beta2-microglobulin (HAT-hbeta2m) both at analytical, small, and preparative scale. In a single scalable operation, extracted and denatured inclusion body proteins from Escherichia coli were continuously diluted into refolding buffer, using a short pipe reactor, allowing for a defined retention and refolding time, and then fed directly to an EBA column, where the protein was captured, washed, and finally eluted as soluble folded protein. Not only was the eluted protein in a correctly folded state, the purity of the HAThbeta2m was increased from 340 94%, and the product was concentrated sevenfold. The yield of the overall process was 45%, and the product loss was primarily a consequence of the refolding reaction rather than the EBA step. Full biological activity of HAT-hbeta2m was demonstrated after removal of the HAT-tag. In contrast to batch refolding, a continuous refolding strategy allows the conditions to be controlled and maintained throughout the process, irrespective of the batch size; i.e., it is readily scalable. Furthermore, the procedure is fast and tolerant toward aggregate formation, a common complication of in vitro protein refolding. In conclusion, this system represents a novel approach to small and preparative scale protein refolding, which should be applicable to many other proteins.	2005 Aug	Ferré Henrik,Ruffet Emmanuel,Nielsen Lise-Lotte B,Nissen Mogens Holst,Hobley Timothy J,Thomas Owen R T,Buus Søren	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 14(8) 2141-53	Beta-2-microglobulin	IQRTPKIQVYSRHPAENGKSNFLNCYVSGFHPSDIEVDLLKNGERIEKVEHSDLSFSKDWSFYLLYYTEFTPTEKDEYACRVNHVTLSQPKIVKWDRDM	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P61769			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

15885615	Improvement of nikkomycin production by enhanced copy of sanU and sanV in Streptomyces ansochromogenes and characterization of a novel glutamate mutase encoded by sanU and sanV.	Previous studies revealed that two genes-sanU and sanV were associated with nikkomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces ansochromogenes. A plasmid used to increase an extra copy of sanU and sanV was constructed and introduced into wild-type strain. HPLC results showed that nikkomycin production of recombinant strain was about 1.8 fold than that of wild-type strain. RT-PCR analysis indicated that the transcriptional level of sanU and sanV in this recombinant strain was about two folds than that of wild-type strain. The sanU and sanV were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). SanU and SanV were purified individually. SanU and SanV assembled with coenzyme B12 to form a complete enzyme in vitro, which showed glutamate mutase activity. The glutamate mutase converted L-glutamate toL-threo-beta-Methylaspartic acid, and then l-threo-beta-Methylaspartic acid was probably deaminated to form 2-oxo-3-methylsuccinic acid to join biosynthetic pathway of the peptidyl moiety HPHT in S. ansochromogenes. SanU is the coenzyme B12-binding component and more than two folds of SanU are required for maximal enzyme activity. The optimal pH and temperature for the formed enzyme are 7.5-8.5 and 35-42 degrees C, respectively. Sulfhydryl compounds are important for activity of the reassembled enzyme.	2005 May	Li Yirong,Ling Hongbo,Li Wenli,Tan Huarong	Metabolic engineering. 7(3) 165-73	Nikkomycin biosynthesis protein SanV	MAPPTGPGRFTRFVRRASSEGKLVVQPRMGFGTVEQMRAGLDAVRTVDAATVGTITVDSYTRVNDHASALLALEKGADLNGFPLVAHGAAVTRELLAGIAGDDFPVQVRHGSALPGALFEGLVAAGVDATEGGPVSYCLPYSRVPLAQAVDAWAECCEMLAGISEPVHLESFGGCMLGQLCPPSLLISLSILEGLFFREHGVRDISVSYAQQTNQQQDIEAIHALRGLAKEWLGDTDWHAVLYTYMGVYPRTRQGAYGLLEESARLAARSGTERLIVKTAVEASRIPSITENVDALERAAWAAEREAVAEPAGIPDSGIYEEAQAIITHTLTLGSDVGKALVRAFALGHLDIPFCLHQDNANRCRARIDDRGRLTWADPAGVPIPRARDLARNRQRLTARGLIDMLSYNERRYDHPSRTSHPR		Q83WU0			7.6	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8876639	The mechanism of autoprocessing of the propeptide of prosubtilisin E: intramolecular or intermolecular event?	The propeptide of subtilisin, an alkaline serine protease, is known to be required for the folding of subtilisin, functioning as an intramolecular chaperone. Upon folding of prosubtilisin, the propeptide of 77 amino acid residues is autocatalytically cleaved. A histidine-tag was added to the N-terminal end of prothiolsubtilisin E, or prosubtilisin(S221C), in which the active site serine residue at position 221 was substituted with cysteine. The histidine-tagged prosubtilisin(S221C) was denatured and immobilized on Ni-NTA resin. The denatured protein was then refolded on the resin, and the efficiency of the renaturation was determined by the efficiency of the propeptide cleavage. It was found that the cleavage of the propeptide was independent of the concentration of prosubtilisin(S221C), indicating that the autoprocessing is an intramolecular reaction. We also showed that prosubtilsin(S221A) can be autoprocessed if it is mixed with histidine-tagged prosubtilsin(S221C). These results demonstrate that prosubtilisin is intrinsically capable of being autoprocessed in an intramolecular manner, while it can also be processed in an intermolecular manner if it exists at higher concentrations.	1996 Oct	Li Y,Inouye M	Journal of molecular biology. 262(5) 591-4	Pro-subtilisin	MRGKKVWISLLFALALIFTMAFGSTSPAQAAGKSNGEKKYIVGFKQTMSTMSAAKKKDVISEKGGKVQKQFKYVDAASATLNEKAVKELKKDPSVAYVEEDHVAQAYAQSVPYGVSQIKAPALHSQGFTGSNVKVAVIDSGIDSSHPDLKVAGGASMVPSETNPFQDNNSHGTHVAGTVAALNNSVGVLGVAPSASLYAVKVLGADGSGQYSWIINGIEWAIANNMDVINMSLGGPSGSAALKAAVDKAVASGVVVVAAAGNEGTSGGSSTVGYPGKYPSVIAVGAVNSSNQRASFSSVGSELDVMAPGVSIQSTLPGNKYGAYNGTSMASPHVAGAAALILSKHPNWTNTQVRSSLENTTTKLGDAFYYGKGLINVQAAAQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q6IT79			7	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8307978	Autoprocessing of prothiolsubtilisin E in which active-site serine 221 is altered to cysteine.	Subtilisin, an extracellular serine protease from Bacillus subtilis, requires the amino-terminal propeptide of 77 amino acid residues for the formation of the active enzyme. The propeptide is cleaved upon completion of folding. Serine 221 at the active center was substituted with cysteine, and the mutant enzyme (prothiolsubtilisin) was expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of a T7 promoter. Prothiosubtilisin, which was produced as inclusion bodies, was dissolved in 6 M guanidine HCl and purified to near homogeneity in the presence of 5 M urea. The purified protein was renatured by stepwise dialysis. In spite of the mutation at the active center, the propeptide was found to be autoprocessed with approximately 60-80 0.000000e+00fficiency. However, protease activity could not be detected in the final product by the spectrophotometric assay. Moreover, the cleaved propeptide remained tightly bound to thiolsubtilisin without being digested, as evident by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amino-terminal sequence of the processed thiolsubtilisin was determined and proved that the propeptide was cleaved at a site identical to that of wild-type prosubtilisin. The processed thiolsubtilisin was also found to contain one free SH group/molecule. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the processing of prosubtilisin occurs by an intramolecular autoprocessing mechanism.	1994 Feb	Li Y,Inouye M	The Journal of biological chemistry. 269(6) 4169-74	Prothiolsubtilizin E	AQSVPYGISQIKAPALHSQGYTGSNVKVAVIDSGIDSSHPDLNVRGGASFVPSETNPYQDGSSHGTHVAGTIAALNNSIGVLGVSPSASLYAVKVLDSTGSGQYSWIINGIEWAICNNMDVINMSLGGPTGSTALKTVVDKAVSSGIVVAAAAGNEGSSGSTSTVGYPAKYPSTIAVGAVNSSNQRASFSSAGSELDVMAPGVSIQSTLPGGTYGAYNGTSMATPHVAGAAALILSKHPTWTNAQVRDRLESTATYLGNSFYYGKGLINVQAAAQ		P04189			7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
8224227	Expression of fully active ammodytoxin A, a potent presynaptically neurotoxic phospholipase A2, in Escherichia coli.	A cDNA encoding the most presynaptically neurotoxic phospholipase A2, ammodytoxin A, from the venom of the long-nosed viper (Vipera ammodytes ammodytes) has been expressed in Escherichia coli. Ammodytoxin A was produced as a fusion protein with the 81 N-terminal residues of adenylate kinase followed by the tetrapeptide recognition site for factor Xa (IEGR) just preceding the first amino acid residue of the toxin. The fusion protein was expressed under the control of tac promoter without IPTG induction in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. It was dissolved in guanidine hydrochloride, S-sulfonated and refolded in a reoxidation mixture including a reduced/oxidized glutathione redox couple. Ammodytoxin A was fully activated by limited hydrolysis with trypsin that preferentially cleaves the fusion protein at the factor Xa recognition site and purified by cation-exchange chromatography. The correct N-terminus was confirmed by protein sequencing. Recombinant ammodytoxin A has been proved to be indistinguishable from the native toxin in its enzymatic activity and toxicity.	1993 Nov	Liang N S,Pungercar J,Krizaj I,Strukelj B,Gubensek F	FEBS letters. 334(1) 55-9	Phospholipase A2, ammodytoxin A	SLLEFGMMILGETGKNPLTSYSFYGCYCGVGGKGTPKDATDRCCFVHDCCYGNLPDCSPKTDRYKYHRENGAIVCGKGTSCENRICECDRAAAICFRKNLKTYNYIYRNYPDFLCKKESEKC		P00626			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
10377255	An aromatic, but not a basic, residue is involved in the toxicity of group-II phospholipase A2 neurotoxins.	Ammodytoxins (Atxs) A, B and C are basic phospholipase A2s from Vipera ammodytes ammodytes snake venom, and they exhibit presynaptic toxicity. The most toxic is AtxA, followed by AtxC, its naturally occurring F124--&gt;I/K128--&gt;E mutant, which is 17 times less toxic. Two mutants of AtxA have been produced in bacteria and characterized. The specific enzymic activity of the K128--&gt;E mutant on mixed phosphatidylcholine/Triton X-100 micelles is similar to that of the wild type. The K108--&gt;N/K111--&gt;N mutant, however, possesses 1600f the wild-type activity. Replacement of the two basic residues by uncharged, polar residues on the opposite side of the protein to the enzyme active site and interfacial adsorption surface results in increased enzymic activity at the water/lipid aggregate interface, due to a redistribution of electrostatic charge. The binding affinity of the double mutant for the specific acceptor in bovine brain was similar to that of AtxA, whereas the affinity of the single mutant was similar to that of AtxC, which was slightly weaker than that of AtxA. Interestingly, the substitution of any of these three basic surface residues did not significantly change the lethal potency of AtxA. Since the single mutant AtxA(K128--&gt;E) is equivalent to the AtxC(I124--&gt;F) mutant, this indicates that the residue at position 124 is important for presynaptic toxicity of Atxs. The more than 10-fold lower toxicity of AtxC, compared with AtxA, is a consequence of the substitution of Phe-124 (aromatic ring) with Ile (aliphatic chain). Exposed aromatic residues in the C-terminal region may also be important for the neurotoxicity of other similar toxins.	1999 Jul	Pungercar J,Krizaj I,Liang N S,Gubensek F	The Biochemical journal. 341 ( Pt 1) 139-45	Phospholipase A2, ammodytoxin A	SLLEFGMMILGETGKNPLTSYSFYGCYCGVGGKGTPKDATDRCCFVHDCCYGNLPDCSPKTDRYKYHRENGAIVCGKGTSCENRICECDRAAAICFRKNLKTYNYIYRNYPDFLCKKESEKC		P00626			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
15958258	Expression, immunochemical characterization and localization of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein p27.	Rv2108 is a gene of the PPE family of Mycobacterium tuberculosis specific for this bacterial complex and that may encode a putative protein p27. This gene was amplified, inserted into bacterial vectors, sequenced, and expressed as a recombinant protein. Specific antibodies to this protein were generated and used for immunochemical characterization and cellular localization. Mass spectrometric analysis of the expressed protein revealed a molecule that corresponded to the p27 putative protein. The expressed protein was immunologically active, and reacted with antibodies from tuberculosis patient sera. Specific immunoblot analysis confirmed the presence of the p27 antigen in Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain and in human clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, but not in other mycobacteria tested. Western blot and immunoelectron microscopic analysis of BCG strain indicated that the p27 protein is localized in the membrane of the cell. The specific expression of the p27 protein in the M. tuberculosis complex could provide a novel specific complimentary diagnostic test for the presence of and infection with M. tuberculosis.	2005 Jul	Le Moigne V,Robreau G,Borot C,Guesdon J-L,Mahana W	Tuberculosis (Edinburgh, Scotland). 85(4) 213-9	Hypothetical 27 kDa protein Also known as: PPE FAMILY PROTEIN	MPNFWALPPEINSTRIYLGPGSGPILAAAQGWNALASELEKTKVGLQSALDTLLESYRGQSSQALIQQTLPYVQWLTTTAEHAHKTAIQLTAAANAYEQARAAMVPPAMVRANRVQTTVLKAINWFGQFSTRIADKEADYEQMWFQDALVMENYWEAVQEAIQSTSHFEDPPEMADDYDEAWMLNTVFDYHNENAKEEVIHLVPDVNKERGPIELVTKVDKEGTIRLVYDGEPTFSYKEHPKF		P95315			7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9020046	The recombinant catalytic domain of mouse collagenase-3 depolymerizes type I collagen by cleaving its aminotelopeptides.	The sequence coding for the catalytic domain of mouse collagenase-3 (MMP-13) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant catalytic domain (CCD), mainly recovered as inclusion bodies, was renatured and purified to homogeneity by preparative SDS-PAGE. The purified CCD degraded gelatin, casein and a synthetic peptide. CCD was not able to cleave the triple-helical domain of type I collagen but conserved the specific property of full-length collagenase-3 to cleave the N-telopeptides. These results show that residues involved in the recognition and cleavage of the aminotelopeptides of type I collagen are located in the catalytic domain of mouse collagenase-3 and that the C-terminal domain is not required for this activity.	1997 Jan	Lemaître V,Jungbluth A,Eeckhout Y	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 230(1) 202-5	Collagenase 3 Also known as Matrix metalloproteinase-13	EYNVFPRTLKWSQTNLTYRIVNYTPDMSHSEVEKAFRKAFKVWSDVTPLNFTRIYDGTADIMISFGTKEHGDFYPFDGPSGLLAHAFPPGPNYGGDAHFDDDETWTSSSKGYNLFIVAAHELGHSLGLDHSKDPGALMFPIYTYTGKSHFMLPDDDVQGIQFLYG		P33435		catalytic domain (Glu 104 to Gly 268)	8.8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15535968	Expression of an immunologically reactive merozoite surface protein (MSP-1(42)) in E. coli.	The 42-kDa carboxyl-terminal processing fragment of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (PfMSP-1(42)) is one of the anti-malarial vaccine candidate antigens. In the present study, recombinant MSP-1(42) was expressed as a fusion protein in a novel E. coli host. The average yield of the recombinant protein was 48 mg/l of bacterial culture. The antigenicity and immunogenicity of the purified protein were evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained from a well-characterized recombinant MSP-1(42) (Bmp42) expressed in the baculovirus expression system previously described from our laboratory. We observed that there is a high degree of similarities between the two recombinant proteins. Based on the results from T and B cell response, in vitro parasite growth inhibition, as well as cross-reactivities with several well-characterized MSP-1 specific Mabs, the bacterial expressed protein is apparently comparable to Bmp42 in terms of immunoreactivities. Our results suggest that the bacterial expression system could be employed to express immunologically active recombinant MSP-1(42) at elevated levels. This system may be an attractive alternative for producing a protective vaccine for human use at lower cost.	2004 Nov	Leung W H,Meng Z Q,Hui G,Ho W K K	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1675(1-3) 62-70	Merozoite Surface Protein-1	VTHESYQELVKKLEALEDAVLTGYGLFHKEKMILNEEEITTKGASAQSGTSGTSGTSGTSGTSGTSGTSAQSGTSGTSAQSGTSGTSAQSGTSGTSGTSGTSPSSRSNTLPRSNTSSGASPPADASDSDAKSYADLKHRVRNYLFTIKELKYPELFDLTNHMLTLCDNIHGFKYLIDGYEEINELLYKLNFYFDLLRAKLNDVCANDYCQIPFNLKIRANELDVLKKLVFGYRKPLDNIKDNVGKMEDYIKKNKTTIANINELIEGSKKTIDQNKNADNEEGKKKLYQAQYDLSIYNKQLEEAHNLISVLEKRIDTLKKNENIKELLDKINEIKNPPPANSGNTPNTLLDKNKKIEEHEEKIKEIAKTIKFNIDSLFTDPLELEYYLREKNKKVDVTPKSQDPTKSVQIPKVPYPNGIVYPLPLTDIHNSLAADNDKNSYGDLMNPDTKEKINEKIITDNKERKIFINNIKKQIDLEEKKINHTKEQNKKLLEDYEKSKKDYEELLEKFYEMKFNNNFDKDVVDKIFSARYTYNVEKQRYNNKFSSSNNSVYNVQKLKKALSYLEDYSLRKGISEKDFNHYYTLKTGLEADIKKLTEEIKSSENKILEKNFKGLTHSANASLEVYDIVKLQVQKVLLIKKIEDLRKIELFLKNAQLKDSIHVPNIYKPQNKPEPYYLIVLKKEVDKLKEFIPKVKDMLKKEQAVLSSITQPLVAASETTEDGGHSTHTLSQSGETEVTEETEETEETVGHTTTVTITLPPKEVKVVENSIEHKSNDNSQALTKTVYLKKLDEFLTKSYICHKYILVSNSSMDQKLLEVYNLTPEEENELKSCDPLDLLFNIQNNIPAMYSLYDSMNNDLQHLFFELYQKEMIYYLHKLKEENHIKKLLEEQKQITGTSSTSSPGNTTVNTAQSATHSNSQNQQSNASSTNTQNGVAVSSGPAVVEESHDPLTVLSISNDLKGIVSLLNLGNKTKVPNPLTISTTEMEKFYENILKNNDTYFNDDIKQFVKSNSKVITGLTETQKNALNDEIKKLKDTLQLSFDLYNKYKLKLDRLFNKKKELGQDKMQIKKLTLLKEQLESKLNSLNNPHNVLQNFSVFFNKKKEAEIAETENTLENTKILLKHYKGLVKYYNGESSPLKTLSEVSIQTEDNYANLEKFRVLSKIDGKLNDNLHLGKKKLSFLSSGLHHLITELKEVIKNKNYTGNSPSENNKKVNEALKSYENFLPEAKVTTVVTPPQPDVTPSPLSVRVSGSSGSTKEETQIPTSGSLLTELQQVVQLQNYDEEDDSLVVLPIFGESEDNDEYLDQVVTGEAISVTMDNILSGFENEYDVIYLKPLAGVYRSLKKQIEKNIFTFNLNLNDILNSRLKKRKYFLDVLESDLMQFKHISSNEYIIEDSFKLLNSEQKNTLLKSYKYIKESVENDIKFAQEGISYYEKVLAKYKDDLESIKKVIKEEKEKFPSSPPTTPPSPAKTDEQKKESKFLPFLTNIETLYNNLVNKIDDYLINLKAKINDCNVEKDEAHVKITKLSDLKAIDDKIDLFKNHNDFEAIKKLINDDTKKDMLGKLLSTGLVQNFPNTIISKLIEGKFQDMLNISQHQCVKKQCPENSGCFRHLDEREECKCLLNYKQEGDKCVENPNPTCNENNGGCDADAKCTEEDSGSNGKKITCECTKPDSYPLFDGIFCS		P04934			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7982945	Construction of a ferroxidase center in human ferritin L-chain.	Ferritins are 24-mer proteins which store and detoxify intracellular iron. Mammalian ferritins are made of two subunit types, the H- and L-chains, with different functional specificity. The H-chain has a metal-binding site (the ferroxidase center) which confers ferroxidase activity to the protein and accelerates iron incorporation. In the L-chain the center is substituted by a salt bridge. We performed several site-directed mutageneses in the L-chain with the aim to construct the center and confer ferroxidase activity to the protein. Most variants were insoluble and did not refold into homopolymers, probably due to electrostatic repulsion introduced by the substitutions. However, they formed hybrids when they were renatured together with the L- or H-chains. The heteropolymers made of 90% L-chain and 100f an L-variant with all the ligand residues of the H-chain center had 25-300f the ferroxidase activity of the H-chain homopolymer. This corresponds to the activity of an H/L heteropolymer with 7% H-chain. It is concluded that: (i) it is possible to construct a ferroxidase center in the L-chain with an activity equivalent to that of the H-chain, (ii) the residues of the center interfere with the folding/assembly of the L-, but not of the H-chain, (iii) heteropolymers can be made even between ferritin subunits with large differences of refolding rates.	1994 Dec	Levi S,Corsi B,Rovida E,Cozzi A,Santambrogio P,Albertini A,Arosio P	The Journal of biological chemistry. 269(48) 30334-9	Ferritin light chain	SSQIRQNYSTDVEAAVNSLVNLYLQASYTYLSLGFYFDRDDVALEGVSHFFRELAEEKREGYERLLKMQNQRGGRALFQDIKKPAEDEWGKTPDAMKAAMALEKKLNQALLDLHALGSARTDPHLCDFLETHFLDEEVKLIKKMGDHLTNLHRLGGPEAGLGEYLFERLTLKHD		P02792			7.4	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

We examined the potential immobilization of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to cellulose with cellulose-binding domain (CBD) as a mediator, using a ligand selected from a phage-displayed random peptide library. A 15-mer random peptide library was panned on cellulose-coated plates covered with CBD in order to find a peptide that binds to CBD in its bound form. The sequence I/LHS, which was found to be an efficient binder of CBD, was fused to a synthetic gene of HRP as an affinity tag. The tagged enzyme (tHRP) was then immobilized on microcrystalline cellulose coated with CBD, thereby demonstrating the indirect immobilization of a protein to cellulose via three amino acids selected by phage display library and CBD.	2001 Jan	Levy I,Shoseyov O	Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society. 7(1) 50-7	Peroxidase N	QLSPDIYAKSCPNLLQIVRDQVKIALKAEIRMAASLIRLHFHDCFVNGCDASVLLDGTNSEKLAIPNVNSVRGFEVIDTIKAAVENACPGVVSCADILTLAARDSVYLSGGPQWRVALGRKDGLVANQSSANNLPSPFEPLDAIIAKFAAVGLNVTDVVALSGAHTFGQAKCDLFSNRLFNFTGAGTPDSTLETTLLSDLQTVCPIGGNGNKTAPLDRNSTDAFDNNYFKNLLEGKGLLSSDQILFSSDLAVNTTKRLVEAYSRSQYLFFRDFTCSMIRMGSLVNGASGEVRTNCRVIN		Q42517			8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12177338	The ferric uptake regulator of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has no essential cysteine residues and does not contain a structural zinc ion.	The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was expressed in Escherichia coli in its native form and as a fusion to the maltose-binding protein (MBP). Fur from the MBP fusion bound to MBP after proteolytic cleavage, and the two could only be separated by partial unfolding. The refolded protein was in the same conformation as native protein (as judged by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopies) and was fully active in DNA-binding assays. As-prepared native Fur contained small amounts of Zn(2+) that were easily removed by treatment with EDTA, and apo-protein could be reconstituted with approximately one Zn(2+) ion per monomer. Thus, the P. aeruginosa Fur can probably accommodate a single Zn(2+) ion bound to the metal-sensing site. The single cysteine residue of P. aeruginosa Fur aligns with a cysteine in other members of the Fur family that is essential for activity of the E. coli protein, and is believed to provide one of the ligands to a structural Zn(2+) ion. This cysteine residue was shown to be dispensable for the in vivo activity of P. aeruginosa Fur, which is consistent with the suggestion that the P. aeruginosa protein does not contain a structural Zn(2+) ion. Members of the Fur family contain a highly conserved His-His-Asp-His motif. Alanine substitutions of residues in this motif showed His-87 and His-89 of P. aeruginosa Fur to be essential for activity, whilst His-86 and Asp-88 are partially dispensable.	2002 Aug	Lewin Allison C,Doughty Phillip A,Flegg Lynda,Moore Geoffrey R,Spiro Stephen	Microbiology (Reading, England). 148(Pt 8) 2449-56	Ferric uptake regulation protein	MVENSELRKAGLKVTLPRVKILQMLDSAEQRHMSAEDVYKALMEAGEDVGLATVYRVLTQFEAAGLVVRHNFDGGHAVFELADSGHHDHMVCVDTGEVIEFMDAEIEKRQKEIVRERGFELVDHNLVLYVRKKK		Q03456			7	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15641362	Hydrophobic interaction chromatography correctly refolding proteins assisted by glycerol and urea gradients.	Chromatographic columns packed with commercially available hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) media were found to be able to suppress aggregation and nevertheless had a tendency to promote the structural misfolding resulting in higher soluble protein recovery and lower specific activity than that by dilution when they were used to refold lysozyme, a model protein. Moreover, this misfolding effect was exacerbated with increasing hydrophobicity of media. A novel strategy involving the combination of glycerol, a typical osmolyte, a urea gradient and commercially available HIC media was introduced to facilitate protein refolding correctly as well as improve mass recovery by providing a gradual change of the refolding environment in the HIC column. In this process, unfolded lysozyme was bound to Poros PE HIC column at high salt concentration and was released by a urea gradient followed by elution with refolding buffer in the presence of 50 % (v/v) glycerol, resulting in 86.3% activity yield and 85% mass recovery with the refolded product of native specific activity. For the absence of glycerol, only 50.9% activity yield and 59pecific activity recovery was obtained although mass recovery was closed to that in the presence of glycerol. It was also discovered that glycerol addition during elution process was necessary for correct refolding compared to mixing of glycerol with post-column fraction. The possible mechanism for refolding with this system was proposed to be relevant to the formation of an on-pathway intermediate that could slowly reactivate.	2004 Dec	Li Jing-Jing,Liu Yong-Dong,Wang Fang-Wei,Ma Guang-Hui,Su Zhi-Guo	Journal of chromatography.

16006145	Immobilized beta-cyclodextrin polymer coupled to agarose gel properly refolding recombinant Staphylococcus aureus elongation factor-G in combination with detergent micelle.	A novel artificial chaperone system using a combination of interactions between the unfolded protein, a detergent and a chromatographic column packed with immobilized beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) polymer coupled to an agarose gel, was introduced to refold recombinant Staphylococcus aureus elongation factor-G (EF-G). Pre-mixing of 10% Triton X-100 and unfolded EF-G at 24 mg/ml followed by a 20-fold dilution into refolding buffer led to successful capturing of EF-G by Triton X-100 resulting in formation of a detergent-protein complex at 1.2mg/ml of final protein concentration. The complex was subsequently applied to the immobilized beta-CD polymer column resulting in correct refolding of EF-G at a concentration of 530 microg/ml with 99% mass recovery. Detergent concentrations above critical micelle concentration were required for efficient capturing of EF-G at high protein concentration. Other detergents with hydrophile-lipophile-Balance values similar to that of Triton X-100 (Triton N-101, Noindet P40 (NP40), and Berol 185) also produced similar result. Soluble polymerized beta-CD was more efficient than the monomer to remove the detergent from the protein complex in a batch system. Immobilized beta-CD polymer column further improved the capability of detergent removal and was able to prevent aggregation that occurred with the addition of soluble beta-CD polymer at high protein concentration in the batch system. The mechanism for this system-assisted refolding was tentatively interpreted: the released protein could correctly refold in an enclosed hydrophilic environment provided by the integration of matrix and beta-CD polymer, and thus avoided aggregation during detergent removal.	2006 Jan	Li Jing-Jing,Venkataramana Musturi,Sanyal Suparna,Janson Jan-Christer,Su Zhi-Guo	Protein expression and purification. 45(1) 72-9	Elongation factor G	AREFSLEKTRNIGIMAHIDAGKTTTTERILYYTGRIHKIGETHEGASQMDWMEQEQDRGITITSAATTAAWEGHRVNIIDTPGHVDFTVEVERSLRVLDGAVTVLDAQSGVEPQTETVWRQATTYGVPRIVFVNKMDKLGANFEYSVSTLHDRLQANAAPIQLPIGAEDEFEAIIDLVEMKCFKYTNDLGTEIEEIEIPEDHLDRAEEARASLIEAVAETSDELMEKYLGDEEISVSELKEAIRQATTNVEFYPVLCGTAFKNKGVQLMLDAVIDYLPSPLDVKPIIGHRASNPEEEVIAKADDSAEFAALAFKVMTDPYVGKLTFFRVYSGTMTSGSYVKNSTKGKRERVGRLLQMHANSRQEIDTVYSGDIAAAVGLKDTGTGDTLCGEKNDIILESMEFPEPVIHLSVEPKSKADQDKMTQALVKLQEEDPTFHAHTDEETGQVIIGGMGELHLDILVDRMKKEFNVECNVGAPMVSYRETFKSSAQVQGKFSRQSGGRGQYGDVHIEFTPNETGAGFEFENAIVGGVVPREYIPSVEAGLKDAMENGVLAGYPLIDVKAKLYDGSYHDVDSSEMAFKIAASLALKEAAKKCDPVILEPMMKVTIEMPEEYMGDIMGDVTSRRGRVDGMEPRGNAQVVNAYVPLSEMFGYATSLRSNTQGRGTYTMYFDHYAEVPKSIAEDIIKKNKGE		P68789			8.6	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f

The mechanism for this system-assisted refolding was tentatively interpreted: the released protein could correctly refold in an enclosed hydrophilic environment provided by the integration of matrix and beta-CD polymer, and thus avoided aggregation during detergent removal.	2006 Jan	Li Jing-Jing,Venkataramana Musturi,Sanyal Suparna,Janson Jan-Christer,Su Zhi-Guo	Protein expression and purification. 45(1) 72-9	Elongation factor G	AREFSLEKTRNIGIMAHIDAGKTTTTERILYYTGRIHKIGETHEGASQMDWMEQEQDRGITITSAATTAAWEGHRVNIIDTPGHVDFTVEVERSLRVLDGAVTVLDAQSGVEPQTETVWRQATTYGVPRIVFVNKMDKLGANFEYSVSTLHDRLQANAAPIQLPIGAEDEFEAIIDLVEMKCFKYTNDLGTEIEEIEIPEDHLDRAEEARASLIEAVAETSDELMEKYLGDEEISVSELKEAIRQATTNVEFYPVLCGTAFKNKGVQLMLDAVIDYLPSPLDVKPIIGHRASNPEEEVIAKADDSAEFAALAFKVMTDPYVGKLTFFRVYSGTMTSGSYVKNSTKGKRERVGRLLQMHANSRQEIDTVYSGDIAAAVGLKDTGTGDTLCGEKNDIILESMEFPEPVIHLSVEPKSKADQDKMTQALVKLQEEDPTFHAHTDEETGQVIIGGMGELHLDILVDRMKKEFNVECNVGAPMVSYRETFKSSAQVQGKFSRQSGGRGQYGDVHIEFTPNETGAGFEFENAIVGGVVPREYIPSVEAGLKDAMENGVLAGYPLIDVKAKLYDGSYHDVDSSEMAFKIAASLALKEAAKKCDPVILEPMMKVTIEMPEEYMGDIMGDVTSRRGRVDGMEPRGNAQVVNAYVPLSEMFGYATSLRSNTQGRGTYTMYFDHYAEVPKSIAEDIIKKNKGE		P68789			8.6	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f

Recombinant Staphylococcus aureus elongation factor G (EF-G) is difficult to refold by dilution due to the formation of large amounts of misfolded structures.

11259612	Identification of two prokineticin cDNAs: recombinant proteins potently contract gastrointestinal smooth muscle.	The motility of gastrointestinal tract is regulated by classical neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and humoral agents. Two novel human cDNAs have been cloned based on their sequence similarity to a frog skin secretion protein, Bv8, and a nontoxic protein of mamba snake venom. These human cDNAs encode two secreted proteins of 86 and 81 amino acids. Northern blot hybridization has revealed that these cDNAs are expressed in gastrointestinal tract, particularly the stomach. Recombinant proteins with authentic N-terminal sequences have been produced in Escherichia coli and refolded into functional proteins by careful control of protein aggregation. Mass spectrometry has confirmed the formation of five pairs of disulfide bonds. The refolded recombinant proteins potently contract gastrointestinal smooth muscle with EC(50) values in the subnanomolar range. The contractile effects of the recombinant proteins are specific for gastrointestinal smooth muscle, because they have no effect on vascular or respiratory smooth muscle. To reflect their potent and specific effects on gastrointestinal smooth muscle cells, we have named these recombinant proteins prokineticins. Ligand binding studies with iodinated prokineticin revealed the presence of a high-affinity site in ileal smooth muscle. The displacement of specific binding by GTP gamma S suggests that the prokineticin receptor may belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Experiments with verapamil and nifedipine revealed that calcium influx is essential for the contractile activity of prokineticins on gastrointestinal smooth muscle. In summary, we have identified two novel endogenous regulators of gastrointestinal motility. The availability of recombinant prokineticins should provide novel therapeutic agents for disorders involving impaired gastrointestinal motility.	2001 Apr	Li M,Bullock C M,Knauer D J,Ehlert F J,Zhou Q Y	Molecular pharmacology. 59(4) 692-8	Prokineticin-2	AVITGACDKDSQCGGGMCCAVSIWVKSIRICTPMGKLGDSCHPLTRKNNFGNGRQERRKRKRSKRKKEVPFFGRRMHHTCPCLPGLACLRTSFNRFICLAQK	C-terminal hexahistidine tag+GST tag	Q9HC23			4.5	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9032126	Elevated expression of endothelin-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: possible involvement of proinflammatory cytokines.	Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoconstrictor, bronchoconstrictor, and mitogenic peptide which is enzymatically converted from a biologically inactive big ET to mature ET (21 amino acid) by the ET-converting enzyme (ECE). Here, we investigate the expression of ECE-1, big ET-1, and ET-1 in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and compare it to those of normal subjects using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In normal lungs, focal moderate expression of all three molecules is localized to airway epithelium, pulmonary endothelium, and airway and vascular smooth muscle cells. Serous bronchial glands also expressed ET-1 and ECE-1. In IPF, strong diffuse expression of ECE-1 was seen in airway epithelium, proliferating type II pneumocytes, and in endothelial and inflammatory cells. ECE-1 immunostaining was colocalized to big ET-1 and ET-1 immunostaining, and correlated with disease activity (P &lt; 0.05). To study regulatory mechanisms of ET-1 and ECE-1 expression, human normal bronchial epithelial (NBE) cells were treated with cytokines and analyzed by radioimmunoassay and Northern blot. Incubation of human NBE cells with IL-1alpha and -beta or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) resulted in a significant increase in ET-1 release and mRNA expression. TNFalpha resulted in a significant increase in ECE-1 mRNA expression. These findings demonstrated the colocalization of the precursor and active ET-1, and ECE-1 in the same cell, and that ECE-1 expression is elevated in IPF. In addition, increased expression of ET-1 and ECE-1 in IPF may be mediated by proinflammatory cytokines.	1997 Feb	Saleh D,Furukawa K,Tsao M S,Maghazachi A,Corrin B,Yanagisawa M,Barnes P J,Giaid A	American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology. 16(2) 187-93	Erythromycin resistance protein also known as rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase	MARAPRSPHPARSRETSRAHPPYGTRADRAPGRGRDRDRSPDSPGNTSSRDGGRSPDRARRELSQNFLARRAVAERVARLVRPAPGGLLLEVGAGRGVLTEALAPYCGRLVAHEIDPRLLPALRDRFGGPHHAHVRISGGDFLAAPVPREPFALAGNIPYSRTAGIVDWALRARTLTSATFVTQLEYARKRTGDYGRWSLLTVRTWPRHEWRLLGRVSRREFRPVPRVDSGILRIERRERPLLPSAALGDYHRMVELGFSGVGGSLYASLRRAHRAGPLDAAFRAARLDRSVVVAYVTPEQWLTVFRTLRPVRSRPAGR	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P45439			7	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
15721787	Production of recombinant amyloid-beta peptide 42 as an ubiquitin extension.	Amyloid-beta peptide 42 (Abeta42) mediates neuronal degeneration in Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). We sought to produce recombinant Abeta42 as an ubiquitin extension. A synthetic oligonucleotide encoding Abeta42 was constructed and cloned as an extended polypeptide of hexahistidine-tagged ubiquitin (H(6)Ub) using the pET vector. Isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside induction of transformed Escherichia coli resulted in the production of large amounts of insoluble H(6)Ub-Abeta42 fusion protein. H(6)Ub-Abeta42 was solubilized in 8 M urea and applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column for purification. Column washing removed the urea and soluble H(6)Ub-Abeta42 was eluted, indicating that covalently attached ubiquitin prevented Abeta42 from aggregating. Abeta42 was cleaved from H(6)Ub using recombinant yeast ubiquitin hydrolase-1 (YUH-1) and purified using reverse-phase chromatography. The recombinant Abeta42 prepared in this study has the same toxic effect on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells comparing with chemically synthesized, commercial one. The peptide yield was more than 4 mg/L culture, indicating this ubiquitin fusion technique is an attractive method for production of aggregation-prone peptides such as Abeta42.	2005 Mar	Lee Eun Kyung,Hwang Jin Ha,Shin Dong Yeon,Kim Dae Ihn,Yoo Yung Joon	Protein expression and purification. 40(1) 183-9	Amyloid beta A4 protein Cleaved into: Beta-amyloid protein 42	MQIFVKTLTGKTITLEVEPSDTIENVKAKIQDKEGIPPDQQRLIFAGKQLEDGRTLSDYNIQKESTLHLVLRLRGGDAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P05067			8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

15843041	Dictyostelium CBP3 associates with actin cytoskeleton and is related to slug migration.	Calcium-binding protein 3 (CBP3) expression was up-regulated under the control of the actin 15 promoter and down-regulated by RNA interference in Dictyostelium discoideum. The overexpression of CBP3 accelerated cell aggregation and formed small aggregates and fruiting body. CBP3-inhibited cells showed uneven aggregation and increased slug trail lengths toward the directed light, whereas CBP3-overexpressing cells showed the opposite phenomena. Under dark condition, the enhanced slug trail length was also observed in the CBP3-inhibited cells. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified actin 8 as interacting protein with CBP3. The interaction between CBP3 and actin was confirmed by beta-galactosidase assay and surface plasmon resonance. CBP3 was associated with Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeleton in the presence of Ca(2+) and the interaction of CBP3 with cytoskeleton was increased by the addition of Ca(2+). Using fluorescence microscopy, CBP3 was also shown to associate with the actin cytoskeleton during development. Subcellular fractionation indicated that CBP3 was enriched in cytosolic fraction. Taken together, these results suggest that CBP3 interacts with actin cytoskeleton and has a role during cell aggregation and slug migration of Dictyostelium.	2005 Apr	Lee Chang-Hun,Jeong Sun-Young,Kim Beom-Jun,Choi Chang-Hoon,Kim Ji-Sun,Koo Byung-Mo,Seok Young-Jae,Yim Hyung-Soon,Kang Sa-Ouk	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1743(3) 281-90	Calcium-binding protein C also known as Calcium-binding protein 3	MLTNNEIYQEVQKFAKGYDLNQDGVLTSQEIYYSLLKKMNGNSYEASKATGVLCSTIDINKDGKFSYHEIAKYCADNAKKLIEQNADIAALADVEAFLLRFDKDKDRKLNKTEFVEYFKGGTDTPYSDRDYVLKIIDLDKDGCVSANELQEWFKKKRIDYASRPHC	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q54QT7			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16122942	Purification and antigenicity of two recombinant forms of Boophilus microplus yolk pro-cathepsin expressed in inclusion bodies.	The tick Boophilus microplus is a bovine ectoparasite present in tropical and subtropical areas of the world and the use of vaccines is a promising method for tick control. BYC is an aspartic proteinase found in eggs that is involved in the embryogenesis of B. microplus and was proposed as an important antigen in the development of an anti-tick vaccine. The cDNA of BYC was amplified by PCR and cloned for expression in two forms with and without thioredoxin fusion protein (Trx), coding recombinant proteins named rBYC-Trx and rBYC, respectively. Expression, solubility, and yields of the two forms were analyzed. The recombinant proteins were expressed in inclusion bodies (IBs) and three denaturant agents (N-lauroyl sarcosine, guanidine hydrochloride, and urea) were tested for IBs solubilization. The N-lauroyl sarcosine solubilized 90.4 and 92.40f rBYC-Trx and rBYC IBs, respectively, and was the most efficient denaturant. Two recombinant forms were affinity-purified by Ni2+-Sepharose under denaturing conditions. After dialysis, the yield of soluble protein was 84.1 0.000000or r-BYC-Trx and 5.9 0.000000or rBYC. These proteins were immune-reactive against sera from rabbit, mouse, and bovine previously immunized with native BYC, which confirms the antigenicity of the recombinant BYCs expressed in the Escherichia coli system.	2006 Jan	Leal Alexandre T,Pohl Paula C,Ferreira Carlos A S,Nascimento-Silva Maria C L,Sorgine Marcos H F,Logullo Carlos,Oliveira Pedro L,Farias Sandra E,da Silva Vaz Itabajara,Masuda Aoi	Protein expression and purification. 45(1) 107-14	Yolk cathepsin	RKDRIIMSNLFHSSSEEVGQTIPLNYTQLQYFGNITIGTPPQTFRVIFDTASNLTWVPSVGCSVEQCQDRPLYDNRHSSTYGAYGIWVTAPYIGGGAITGTAAYETITIAGINVTNQLFVEATVIDPKIYNGVQFDGSIGLSIESLYLSQHWSIFDNMFINHLLPEPVFAFYFHPTVNGSDGELILGGIEKSHYEGELTYTQSATDEWLIRLQGVKVGMRWLQTEYIYAKPVSTLPYIYGPQSQIDSINKALNASKTSGDEYTVDCSNITALPIISIKISGKNFDLRPQDYIVEVNSXCYSGFVVDEDHQQPGASTWLLGQNFLRRVYTIFKTGIFLWDKQLAFAYTRPIVY	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q56CZ1			9	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
1666621	High level expression in Escherichia coli of isopenicillin N synthase genes from Flavobacterium and Streptomyces, and recovery of active enzyme from inclusion bodies.	A T7 promoter-based vector was used to express the isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) genes of Flavobacterium sp. 12,154 and Streptomyces jumonjinensis in Escherichia coli. Most of the IPNS synthesized at 37 degrees C, and representing some 22% and 510f the total cell protein respectively, occurred in an insoluble, enzymatically inactive form. Active IPNS was recovered in a rapid and simple two-step procedure in which the insoluble material was first denatured in 5 M urea and then refolded by passing the solubilized IPNS through a G-25 Sephadex sizing column. Further chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose resulted in highly active IPNS preparations. This procedure was found to be well suited for scaling up to produce large amounts of IPNS.	1991 Dec	Landman O,Shiffman D,Av-Gay Y,Aharonowitz Y,Cohen G	FEMS microbiology letters. 68(3) 239-44	Isopenicillin N synthetase	MNRHADVPVIDISGLSGNDMDVKKDIAARIDRACRGSGFFYAANHGVDLAALQKFTTDWHMAMSAEEKWELAIRAYNPANPRNRNGYYMAVEGKKANESFCYLNPSFDADHATIKAGLPSHEVNIWPDEARHPGMRRFYEAYFSDVFDVAAVILRGFAIALGREESFFERHFSMDDTLSAVSLIRYPFLENYPPLKLGPDGEKLSFEHHQDVSLITVLYQTAIPNLQVETAEGYLDIPVSDEHFLVNCGTYMAHITNGYYPAPVHRVKYINAERLSIPFFANLSHASAIDPFAPPPYAPPGGNPTVSYGDYLQHGLLDLIRANGQT		P16020			8	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16195554	Ionic liquids as refolding additives: N&#39;-alkyl and N&#39;-(omega-hydroxyalkyl) N-methylimidazolium chlorides.	The purpose of this work was to investigate the influence of a series of N&#39;-alkyl and N&#39;-(omega-hydroxy-alkyl)-N-methylimidazolium chlorides on the renaturation of two model proteins, namely hen egg white lysozyme and the single-chain antibody fragment ScFvOx. All tested ionic liquids acted as refolding enhancers, with varying efficacies and efficiencies. The results of the refolding screening could be interpreted by taking into account the effect of the studied ionic liquids on protein aggregation, together with the systematic variations of their influence on the stability of native proteins in solution. More hydrophobic imidazolium cations carrying longer alkyl chains were increasingly destabilizing, while terminal hydroxylation of the alkyl chain made the salts more compatible with protein stability. The studied ionic liquids can be classified as preferentially bound, slightly to moderately chaotropic cosolvents for proteins.	2005 Oct	Lange Christian,Patil Ganesh,Rudolph Rainer	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 14(10) 2693-701	Lysozyme	MRSLLILVLCFLPLAALGKVFGRCELAAAMKRHGLDNYRGYSLGN		Q6LEL2			8.2	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15575723	Operational regimes for a simplified one-step artificial chaperone refolding method.	The &quot;artificial chaperone method&quot; for protein refolding developed by Rozema et al. (Rozema, D.; Gellman, S. H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117 (8), 2373-2374) involves the sequential dilution of denatured protein into a buffer containing detergent (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) and then into a refolding buffer containing cyclodextrin (CD). In this paper a simplified one-step artificial chaperone method is reported, whereby CTAB is added directly to the denatured solution, which is then diluted directly into a refolding buffer containing beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). This new method can be applied at high protein concentrations, resulting in smaller processing volumes and a more concentrated protein solution following refolding. The increase in achievable protein concentration results from the enhanced solubility of CTAB at elevated temperatures in concentrated denaturant. The refolding yields obtained for the new method were significantly higher than for control experiments lacking additives and were comparable to the yields obtained with the classical two-step approach. A study of the effect of beta-CD and CTAB concentrations on refolding yield suggested two operational regimes: slow stripping (beta-CD/CTAB approximately 1), most suited for higher protein concentrations, and fast stripping (beta-CD/CTAB approximately 2.7), best suited for lower protein concentrations. An increased chaotrope concentration resulted in higher refolding yields and an enlarged operational regime.

The apical membrane antigen 1 of Plasmodium falciparum is one of the leading candidate antigens being developed as a vaccine to prevent malaria. This merozoite transmembrane protein has an ectodomain that can be divided into three subdomains (D I, D II, and D III). We have previously expressed a major portion of this ectodomain and have shown that it can induce antibodies that prevent merozoite invasion into red blood cells in an in vitro growth and invasion assay. To analyze the antibody responses directed against the individual subdomains, we constructed six different genes that express each of the domains separately (D I, D II, or D III) or in combination with another domain (D I+II, D II+III, or D I+III). These proteins were purified and used to immunize rabbits to raise construct-specific antibodies. We demonstrated that D I+II induced a significant amount of the growth-inhibitory antibodies active in the growth and invasion assay.	2004 Aug	Lalitha P V,Ware Lisa A,Barbosa Arnoldo,Dutta Sheetij,Moch J Kathleen,Haynes J David,Fileta Bader B,White Charles E,Lanar David E	Infection and immunity. 72(8) 4464-70	Apical membrane antigen 1	AEPAPQEQNLFSSIEIVERSNYMGNPWTEYMAKYDIEEVHGSGIRVDLGEDAEVAGTQYRLPSGKCPVFGKGIIIENSNTTFLTPVATGNQYLKDGGFAFPPTEPLMSPMTLDEMRHFYKDNKYVKNLDELTLCSRHAGNMIPDNDKNSNYKYPAVYDDKDKKCHILYIAAQENNGPRYCNKDESKRNSMFCFRPAKDISFQNYTYLSKNVVDNWEKVCPRKNLQNAKFGLWVDGN	N-terminal +C terminal hexahistidine tag	P22621		AMA-1 subdomain I (DI)	8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

9761798	Identification of residues in a hydrophilic loop of the Papaver rhoeas S protein that play a crucial role in recognition of incompatible pollen.	The self-incompatibility response involves S allele-specific recognition between stigmatic S proteins and incompatible pollen. This response results in pollen inhibition. Defining the amino acid residues within the stigmatic S proteins that participate in S allele-specific inhibition of incompatible pollen is essential for the elucidation of the molecular basis of the self-incompatibility response. We have constructed mutant derivatives of the S1 protein from Papaver rhoeas by using site-directed mutagenesis and have tested their biological activity. This has enabled us to identify amino acid residues in the stigmatic S proteins of P. rhoeas that are required for S-specific inhibition of incompatible pollen. We report here the identification of several amino acid residues in the predicted hydrophilic loop 6 of the P. rhoeas stigmatic S1 protein that are involved in the inhibition of S1 pollen. Mutation of the only hypervariable amino acid, which is situated in this loop, resulted in the complete loss of ability of the S protein to inhibit S1 pollen. This clearly demonstrates that this residue plays a crucial role in pollen recognition and may also participate in defining allelic specificity. We have also established the importance of highly conserved amino acids adjacent to this hypervariable site. Our studies demonstrate that both variable and conserved amino acids in the region of the S protein corresponding to surface loop 6 are key elements that play a role in the recognition and inhibition of incompatible pollen in the pollen-pistil self-incompatibility reaction.	1998 Oct	Kakeda K,Jordan N D,Conner A,Ride J P,Franklin-Tong V E,Franklin F C	The Plant cell. 10(10) 1723-32	Self-incompatibility protein	RFLPVIEVRIMNKRGNGHSIGIHCRSKDDDLGYHRISDGQQVHFSFRENFFHTTTFNCDIEWDSRRHFNFDSYRAQRDDHGRCTTECLWKTTDEGLYGYDQEHEYWQLYYLAKK		O65870			8	14	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16109374	Conformational change in the catalytic site of the ribonuclease YoeB toxin by YefM antitoxin.	The eubacterial chromosome encodes various addiction modules that control global levels of translation through RNA degradation. Crystal structures of the Escherichia coli YefM2 (antitoxin)-YoeB (toxin) complex and the free YoeB toxin have been determined. The structure of the heterotrimeric complex reveals an asymmetric disorder-to-order recognition strategy, in which one C terminus of the YefM homodimer exclusively interacts with an atypical microbial ribonuclease (RNase) fold of YoeB. Comparison with the YefM-free YoeB structure indicates a conformational rearrangement of the RNase catalytic site of YoeB, induced by interaction with YefM. Complementary biochemical experiments demonstrate that the YoeB toxin has an in vitro RNase activity that preferentially cleaves at the 3&#39; end of purine ribonucleotides.	2005 Aug	Kamada Katsuhiko,Hanaoka Fumio	Molecular cell. 19(4) 497-509	Toxin yoeB	MKLIWSEESWDDYLYWQETDKRIVKKINELIKDTRRTPFEGKGKPEPLKHNLSGFWSRRITEEHRLVYAVTDDSLLIAACRYHY		P69348			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

A kringle fragment (type IV (9)-IV (10)-V) from human apolipoprotein (a) (called LK68) was expressed in an inclusion body in Escherichia coli. The LK68 in this inclusion body was rendered soluble with urea, and efficiently refolded via oxidation in the presence of re-dox couple. The refolded LK68 was then purified via two steps of ion exchange chromatography, concentrated via preparative reversed-phase chromatography, and freeze-dried, at a final yield of approximately 30%. The purified LK68 exhibited profound affinity for lysine and fibrinogen, which suggests the proper folding of the kringle fragment, and also indicates that the native characteristics of apolipoprotein (a) were preserved. The purified LK68 was determined to be highly homogeneous upon reversed-phase HPLC analysis and size-exclusion HPLC analysis, in the presence of 20% (v/v) acetonitrile. However, on size-exclusion HPLC analysis without acetonitrile, it was determined to be somewhat heterogeneous, and this was corroborated by native analyses, including native PAGE and IEF.	2006 Jan	Kang Kwan-Yub,Kim Sung-Geun,Kim Won-Kyung,You Hyun-Kyung,Kim Young-Jo,Lee Jong-Hyuk,Jung Kyung-Hwan,Kim Chan-Wha	Protein expression and purification. 45(1) 216-25	Apolipoprotein(a)	APTEQRPGVQECYHGNGQSYRGTYSTTVTGRTCQAWSSMTPHSHSRTPEYYPNAGLIMNYCRNPDAVAAPYCYTRDPGVRWEYCNLTQCSDAEGTAVAPPTVTPVPSLEAPSEQ		P08519		Kringle 4	8.8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
15866716	The C subunit of Ideonella dechloratans chlorate reductase: expression, purification, refolding, and heme reconstitution.	The C subunit of Ideonella dechloratans chlorate reductase has been expressed in Escherichia coli as a GST fusion protein. Purification from inclusion bodies, followed by refolding and reconstitution with heme, produced a protein with a heme/protein ratio of 0.4, and with UV-vis spectral characteristics similar to those of native chlorate reductase. Wavelength maxima for the alpha and beta bands in the reduced state were 559 and 529 nm for both native chlorate reductase and the reconstituted recombinant subunit, whereas the reduced Soret bands were found at 426 and 424 nm, respectively. These results support the notion of the C subunit as the cytochrome b moiety of I. dechloratans chlorate reductase. Moreover, the availability of a recombinant version of the C subunit is expected to facilitate further studies of electron transfer and protein interaction included in the reaction catalyzed by chlorate reductase.	2005 Jun	Karlsson Jan,Nilsson Thomas	Protein expression and purification. 41(2) 306-12	Chlorate reductase subunit gamma	AQGAVPQAQRIIRVLSVAGGDAASPQAAVWKKAPTTQVTLLTAFPGHISIVGTAATQKLAAQAVRASGRLFVRLAWSDRTANTVMKDTDQFLDGAAVEFPVNGKVATLPFMGDPVNVVNVWHWRADGRTLNLLAKGFGTSTPVPTEDLRSASVRTGDGWEVVLSRPLRVKAEEGANLQGRRTMPIGFAAWDGENQERDGLKAVTMEWWQLRF	GST	P60000			8.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7764560	High-level expression of porcine muscle adenylate kinase in Escherichia coli: effects of the copy number of the gene and the translational initiation signals.	Porcine muscle adenylate kinase (ADK) was overproduced in Escherichia coli using the expression plasmid with double A-T-G codon at the translational starting site and the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence 10 bp apart from the first A-T-G. We used the expression vectors pKK223-3 and pMK2. pMK2 is about 10-20 times larger in copy number than pK223-3. For both vectors, duplication of A-T-G was effective and the quantity of the expressed ADK from the double A-T-G plasmid was 2 approximately 4-fold more than that achieved when only one A-T-G was present. The amount of the produced ADK was maximum in the case of using pMK2 with double A-T-G. The overproduced ADK formed inclusion bodies in E. coli. It was solubilized in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and refolded. Through two steps of column chromatography, ADK was purified. It has the same amino acid composition and grossly the same activity as that reported by Schirmer et al. (1970). Its amino acid sequence of the NH2-terminal region was identical with that deduced from the cDNA sequence including the NH2-terminal methionine.	1994 Feb	Hibino T,Misawa S,Wakiyama M,Maeda S,Yazaki K,Kumagai I,Ooi T,Miura K	Journal of biotechnology. 32(2) 139-48	Adenylate kinase	MEEKLKKSKIIFVVGGPGSGKGTQCEKIVQKYGYTHLSTGDLLRAEVSSGSARGKMLSEIMEKGQLVPLETVLDMLRDAMVAKVDTSKGFLIDGYPREVKQGEEFERKIGQPTLLLYVDAGPETMTKRLLKRGETSGRVDDNEETIKKRLETYYKATEPVIAFYEKRGIVRKVNAEGSVDDVFSQVCTHLDTLK		P00571			7.4	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12834976	Effect of column dimensions and flow rates on size-exclusion refolding of beta-lactamase.	We have investigated the effect of changing the column diameter and length on the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) refolding of beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli-derived inclusion bodies (IBs). Inclusion bodies were recovered and solubilised in 6 M GdnHCl and 5 mM DTT. Up to 16 mg of denatured, solubilised beta-lactamase was loaded onto size exclusion columns packed with Sephacryl S-300 media (fractionation range: 10(4)-1.5 x 10(6) Da). beta-Lactamase was refolded by eluting the loaded sample with 1 M urea in 0.05 M phosphate buffer, pH 7 at 23 degrees C. The following columns were studied: 26 x 400, 16 x 400 and 26 x 200 mm, with a range of mobile phase flow rates from 0.33 to 4.00 ml/min. beta-Lactamase was successfully refolded in all three columns and at all flow rates studied. The beta-lactamase activity peak coincided with the major protein peak. Reducing the column diameter had little effect on refolding performance. The enzyme activity recovered was relatively independent of the mobile phase linear velocity. Reducing the column length gave a poorer resolution of the protein peaks, but the enzyme activity peaks were well resolved. Calculation of the partition coefficients for beta-lactamase activity showed that the 26 x 400 column gave the greatest refolding performance.	2003 Jun	Harrowing Sarah R,Chaudhuri Julian B	Journal of biochemical and biophysical methods. 56(1-3) 177-88	beta-lactamase	APQQINDIVHRTITPLIEQQKIPGMAVAVIYQGKPYYFTWGYADIAKKQPVTQQTLFELGSVSKTFTGVLGGDAIARGEIKLSDPTTKYWPELTAKQWNGITLLHLATYTAGGLPLQVPDEVKSSSDLLRFYQNWQPAWAPGTQRLYANSSIGLFGALAVKPSGLSFEQAMQTRVFQPLKLNHTWINVPPAEEKNYAWGYREGKAVHVSPGALDAEAYGVKSTIEDMARWVQSNLKPLDINEKTLQQGIQLAQSRYWQTGDMYQGLGWEMLDWPVNPDSIINGSDNKIALAARPVKAITPPTPAVRASWVHKTGATGGFGSYVAFIPEKELGIVMLANKNYPNPARVDAAWQILNALQ		P00811			7	0	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10049672	Purification and characterization of a plant antimicrobial peptide expressed in Escherichia coli.	MiAMP1 is a low-molecular-weight, cysteine-rich, antimicrobial peptide isolated from the nut kernel of Macadamia integrifolia. A DNA sequence encoding MiAMP1 with an additional ATG start codon was cloned into a modified pET vector under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The pET vector was cotransformed together with the vector pSB161, which expresses a rare arginine tRNA. The peptide was readily isolated in high yield from the insoluble fraction of the Escherichia coli extract. The purified peptide was shown to have an identical molecular weight to the native peptide by mass spectroscopy indicating that the N-terminal methionine had been cleaved. Analysis by NMR spectroscopy indicated that the refolded recombinant peptide had a similar overall three-dimensional structure to that of the native peptide. The peptide inhibited the growth of phytopathogenic fungi in vitro in a similar manner to the native peptide. To our knowledge, MiAMP1 is the first antimicrobial peptide from plants to be functionally expressed in E. coli. This will permit a detailed structure-function analysis of the peptide and studies of its mode of action on phytopathogens.	1999 Mar	Harrison S J,McManus A M,Marcus J P,Goulter K C,Green J L,Nielsen K J,Craik D J,Maclean D J,Manners J M	Protein expression and purification. 15(2) 171-7	Antimicrobial peptide 1	SAFTVWSGPGCNNRAERYSKCGCSAIHQKGGYDFSYTGQTAALYNQAGCSGVAHTRFGSSARACNPFGWKSIFIQC	N-terminal methionine	P80915				0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
15135414	Purification and refolding of human alpha5-subunit (PSMA5) of the 20S proteasome, expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.	The 20S proteasome is the central enzyme of nonlysosomal protein degradation in both the cytosol and nucleus. It is composed of 28 protein subunits which are arranged into four staggered heptameric rings. The outer rings consist of alpha-subunits which are responsible for binding of proteasome activators, inhibitors, and regulators. To better characterize human alpha5-subunit (PSMA5) of the 20S proteasome, we have established a high-efficiency Escherichia coli expression system. The DNA-coding sequence for the human PSMA5, which was subcloned into the vector pET-22b (+), has been expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 (DE3). To produce the native PSMA5, straightforward protocols have been developed for refolding the human PSMA5 in the presence of surfactants using dilution refolding and size-exclusion chromatography matrix refolding methods. After refolding, recovery yields of about 20% were obtained, respectively, with purity above 95%. The human PSMA5 was detected by dynamic light scattering in refolding process, and the molecular weight of the final refolded product was measured using gel filtration chromatography, which indicates that the human PSMA5 exists mainly as tetramer.	2004 Jun	Han Yu-Gang,Liu He-Li,Zheng Hong-Jin,Li Sheng-Guang,Bi Ru-Chang	Protein expression and purification. 35(2) 360-5	Proteasome subunit alpha type-5	MFLTRSEYDRGVNTFSPEGRLFQVEYAIEAIKLGSTAIGIQTSEGVCLAVEKRITSPLMEPSSIEKIVEIDAHIGCAMSGLIADAKTLIDKARVETQNHWFTYNETMTVESVTQAVSNLALQFGEEDADPGAMSRPFGVALLFGGVDEKGPQLFHMDPSGTFVQCDARAIGSASEGAQSSLQEVYHKSMTLKEAIKSSLIILKQVMEEKLNATNIELATVQPGQNFHMFTKEELEEVIKDI	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P28066			7.3	30	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

9531469	Bacterial expression and characterization of human secretory class V phospholipase A2.	Mammalian secretory class V phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is a newly discovered PLA2 that is implicated in eicosanoid formation in inflammatory cells. As a first step towards understanding the structure, function and regulation of this PLA2, we constructed a bacterial expression vector for human secretory class V PLA2 (hV-PLA2), over-expressed and purified the protein, and determined its physical and kinetic properties. When compared with human class IIa enzyme (hIIa-PLA2), hV-PLA2 has several distinct properties. First, hV-PLA2 can catalyse the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine more effectively than hIIa-PLA2 by two orders of magnitude. Secondly, hV-PLA2 has much higher binding affinity and activity for compactly packed phosphatidylcholine bilayers than hIIa-PLA2. Finally, hV-PLA2 has much reduced thermal stability compared with hIIa-PLA2. These data suggest that hV-PLA2 is better suited than hIIa-PLA2 for acting on the outer cellular membrane and liberating arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Also, the unusually low thermal stability of hV-PLA2 might contribute to tighter regulation of its activities in extracellular media.	1998 Apr	Han S K,Yoon E T,Cho W	The Biochemical journal. 331 ( Pt 2) 353-7	Phospholipase A2	AVWQFRKMIKCVIPGSDPFLEYNNYGCYCGLGGSGTPVDELDKCCQTHDNCYDQAKKLDSCKFLLDNPYTHTYSYSCSGSAITCSSKNKECEAFICNCDRNAAICFSKAPYNKAHKNLDTKKYCQS		P04054			7.4	25	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15614567	Cloning, recombinant expression and biochemical characterisation of novel esterases from Bacillus sp. associated with the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba.	Two novel esterases (EstB1 and EstB2) were isolated from a genomic library of Bacillus sp. associated with the marine sponge Aplysina aerophoba. EstB1 shows low identity (26-44%) with the published hydrolases of the genus Bacillus, whereas EstB2 shows high identity (73-74%) with the carboxylesterases from B. cereus and B. anthracis. Both esterases were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of T7 promoter using the vector pET-22b(+). Recombinant EstB1 was purified in a single step to electrophoretic homogeneity by IMAC. A method for the refolding of inclusion bodies formed by the recombinant EstB2 was established to obtain active enzyme. Substrate specificity of the two enzymes towards p-nitrophenyl and methyl esters and the respective kinetic parameters K(m) and V(max) were determined. The temperature optima of EstB1 and EstB2 were determined to be in the range of 30-50 degrees C and 20-35 degrees C, respectively. The pH optima were found to be in the range of 6.5-7.5 and 6.5-8.0, respectively. Both enzymes showed the highest stability in up to 50% (v/v) DMSO followed by methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. The influence of high NaCl and KCl concentrations was tested. The inhibition effect of 10-50 mM Zn(2+) and 50 mM Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) ions was observed for both esterases. One to five millimolar PMSF deactivated the enzymes, whereas beta-mercaptoethanol, DTT and EDTA had no effect on the enzymes activity.	2005 Apr	Karpushova A,Brümmer F,Barth S,Lange S,Schmid R D	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 67(1) 59-69	Estrases also known as EstB2	MKVVAPKPFTFEGGNRAVLMLHGFTGNSADVRMMGRYLQEQGYTCHAPQYKGHGVPPEELVHTGPSDWWKDVQEGYNKLKEMGHDEIAVVGLSLGGVFSLKLGYTVPVKGIVPMCAPMDMKDEETMYEGVLAYARDYKKYERKSPEQIEEEMEAFKETPMNTLGELRDLIYDVRDNIDMIYAPTFVVQARHDEMINTDSANVIHDNIESDEKSLKWYENSTHVITLGKEKEVLHEDVLEFLNGLDWKE	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q6DV84			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9753643	Gene synthesis, expression, and mutagenesis of zucchini mavicyanin: the fourth ligand of blue copper center is Gln.	The gene coding for the 109-amino-acid, non-glycosylated form of mavicyanin was synthesized and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein refolded from E. coli inclusion bodies was purified and characterized. Its spectroscopic properties are fully identical to those of mavicyanin isolated from zucchini, even in the absence of its carbohydrate moiety. The blue cooper center of mavicyanin strongly binds three ligands (2His and Cys) as well as many blue copper proteins. To disclose the fourth ligand of mavicyanin, Met was substituted for Gln95 by site-directed mutagenesis. The replacement changes from a rhombic EPR signal to an axial one and exhibits the quite similar absorption and CD spectra to those of plastocyanin. The midpoint potential of Gln95--&gt;Met mavicyanin shows the positive shift of 187 mV compared with the recombinant protein, being close to the values of plastocyanins. The differences of the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties between mavicyanin and its mutant demonstrate that the fourth ligand of mavicyanin is Gln95.	1998 Sep	Kataoka K,Nakai M,Yamaguchi K,Suzuki S	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 250(2) 409-13	Mavicyanin	ATVHKVGDSTGWTTLVPYDYAKWASSNKFHVGDSLLFNYNNKFHNVLQVDQEQFKSCNSSSPAASYTSGADSIPLKRPGTFYFLCGIPGHCQLGQKVEIKVDPGSSSA	N-terminal T7 tag	P80728			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

15769595	Overexpression and characterization of a novel chitinase from Trichoderma atroviride strain P1.	We describe the overexpression and characterization of a new 30 kDa family 18 chitinase (Ech30) from Trichoderma atroviride strain P1. Sequence alignments indicate that the active site architecture of Ech30 resembles that of endochitinases such as hevamine from the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). The ech30 gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli without its signal peptide and with an N-terminal His-tag. The enzyme was produced as inclusion bodies, from which active chitinase could be recovered using a simple refolding procedure. The enzyme displayed an acidic pH-optimum (pH 4.5-5.0), probably due to the presence of a conserved Asn residue near the catalytic glutamate, which is characteristic for acidic family 18 chitinases. Studies with oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine [(GlcNAc)(n)], 4-methylumbelliferyl (4-MU) labelled GlcNAc oligomers and beta-chitin reveal enzymatic properties typical of an endochitinase: 1) low activity towards short substrates (kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of 4-MU-(GlcNAc)2 were K(m), 149+/-29 microM and k(cat), 0.0048+/-0.0005 s(-1)), and 2) production of relatively large amounts of trimers and tetramers during degradation of beta-chitin. Detailed studies with GlcNAc oligomers indicated that Ech30 has as many as seven subsites for sugar binding. As expected for a family 18 chitinase, catalysis proceeded with retention of the beta-anomeric configuration.	2005 May	Hoell Ingunn A,Klemsdal Sonja S,Vaaje-Kolstad Gustav,Horn Svein J,Eijsink Vincent G H	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1748(2) 180-90	Chitinase ECH30	MYFRKAAAVTSLLAALSSAQPSGPELAVYWGAEDDSTTLNDVCSDSSYGIVNLAFLDTFFAAGGFPQLSLSGLDGPSQAQQSAGATGLKDGSSLVDAIQQCQSAGKLVLLSLGGAGADVTLQSDSDGEKIADTLWNLFGGGTDNQELRPFGDIKLDGFDLDNESGNPTGYLAMVQRFKSNFQNDTSKSYFLSAAPQCPFPDASQSQDVCSELDFVWVQFYNNGDCNIAQCDFLNSVQTWSSGIGNAKLYIGALASGADGDQGFADANTLLGAIQDVKNMNLPNYAGAMLWEAQLAVQNGNFQQKIAPGL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q56VR5			8	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9367813	Refolding of a recombinant collagen-targeted TGF-beta2 fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli.	In this study, a tripartite transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta2) fusion protein bearing an N-terminal purification tag and an auxiliary collagen binding decapeptide has been constructed and expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli. The resulting recombinant protein accumulates in an insoluble and biologically inactive inclusion-body complex. The insoluble protein was solubilized in guanidine hydrochloride and a Ni-chelating affinity column was utilized to isolate the 13.5-kDa TGF-beta2 fusion protein, which was then refolded into its native conformation under controlled redox conditions. The formation of native homodimers was monitored by nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gradient gels and the bioactivity determined by a quantitative TGF-beta assay system using mink lung epithelial cells transfected with a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter/luciferase reporter plasmid. To optimize yields, renaturation conditions including denaturants, limiting protein concentrations, redox ratios, dialysis conditions, and refolding kinetics were studied and monitored by bioactivity. These studies demonstrate that recombinant TGF-beta2 fusion proteins can be produced in E. coli and renatured into biologically active homodimers. Furthermore, they confirm that the auxiliary collagen binding domain effectively targets the recombinant growth factor to type I collagen. Taken together, these studies advance the technology necessary to generate large quantities of targeted TGF-beta fusion proteins for specific biomedical applications.	1997 Nov	Han B,Hall F L,Nimni M E	Protein expression and purification. 11(2) 169-78	Transforming growth factor beta 2	ALDAAYCFRNVQDNCCLRPLYIDFKRDLGWKWIHEPKGYNANFCAGACPYLWSSDTQHSRVLSLYNTINPEASASPCCVSQDLEPLTILYYIGKTPKIEQLSNMIVKSCKCS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P61812			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12597887	Expression, oxidative refolding, and characterization of six-histidine-tagged recombinant human LECT2, a 16-kDa chemotactic protein with three disulfide bonds.	Human LECT2 is a 16-kDa chemotactic protein that consists of 133 amino acids and three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Here, we present the oxidative refolding of (His)(6)-LECT2, an N-terminally (His)(6)-tagged recombinant protein of human LECT2. (His)(6)-LECT2 was overproduced in Escherichia coli in the form of insoluble aggregates, solubilized with 8 M urea in the presence of 10 mM DTT, and purified and refolded on Ni-NTA agarose by lowering the urea concentration before the elution. This process, however, gave a mixture of oligomers of (His)(6)-LECT2 as well as the monomer, whose composition was as low as 36%. The oligomers formed as a result of incorrect intermolecular disulfide bonds. After the refolding on Ni-NTA agarose (step 1), the disulfide bonds were shuffled using a glutathione redox buffer (step 2) and the remaining thiols were completely oxidized (step 3) to improve the yield of correctly folded, monomeric (His)(6)-LECT2. The monomer composition was significantly improved to 810y the three-step refolding method and the monomer thus obtained was shown to have the same conformation as the authentic LECT2 produced in CHO cells by CD and NMR spectroscopies. The yield of (His)(6)-LECT2 was 1.0 mg/L E. coli culture and was 16 times as high as that in our previous report, in which (His)(6)-LECT2 was purified from the soluble fractions of E. coli cell lysates.	2003 Feb	Ito Mie,Nagata Koji,Kato Yusuke,Oda Yoshifumi,Yamagoe Satoshi,Suzuki Kazuo,Tanokura Masaru	Protein expression and purification. 27(2) 272-8	Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2	GPWANICAGKSSNEIRTCDRHGCGQYSAQRSQRPHQGVDVLCSAGSTVYAPFTGMIVGQEKPYQNKNAINNGVRISGRGFCVKMFYIKPIKYKGPIKKGEKLGTLLPLQKVYPGIQSHVHIENCDSSDPTAYL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O14960			7.9	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9731180	Bacterial overexpression, purification, and reconstitution of the carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier from rat liver mitochondria.	The carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier from rat liver mitochondria was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein, recovered as inclusion bodies, was solubilized with sarkosyl and purified by Sephadex G-200 and celite chromatography. A yield of 15 mg of purified transport protein per liter of cell culture was obtained. Upon reconstitution into liposomes, the purified carrier catalyzed a [3H]carnitine/carnitine exchange inhibited by maleimides, mercurials, and sulfobetaines. Carnitine esters of various lengths were also transported. The Km for carnitine uptake was 0.47 +/- 0.11 mM, the Vmax of the exchange was 0.78 +/- 0.24 mmol/min per gram of protein, and the Ki for octanoylcarnitine was 13.5 +/- 4.3 microM. The transport properties of the recombinant carrier were virtually identical to those of the native transporter. These studies represent the first overexpression of the functionally active mitochondrial carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier, thus enabling structure/function analysis of this protein by site-directed mutagenesis.	1998 Aug	Indiveri C,Iacobazzi V,Giangregorio N,Palmieri F	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 249(3) 589-94	Carnitine/acylcarnitine carrier protein mitochondrial	MAEEPKPISPLKNLLAGGFGGVCLVFVGHPLDTVKVRLQTQPPSLPGQPPMYSGTIDCFRKTLFREGITGLYRGMAAPIIGVTPMFAVCFFGFGLGKRLQQKSPEDELTYPQLFTAGMLSGVFTTGIMTPGERIKCLLQIQASSGKNKYSGTLDCAKKLYQEFGIRGFYKGTALTLMRDVPASGMYFMTYEWLKNLFTPQGKSVHDLSVPRVLVAGGFRGIFNWVVAIPPDVLKSRFQTAPPGKYPNGFRDVLRELIREEGVTSLYKGFNAVMIRAFPANAACFLGFEIPMKILNWIAPNL		P97521			7	0	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2659343	Primary structure of nitrile hydratase deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a Rhodococcus species and its expression in Escherichia coli.	The nitrile hydratase (NHase) of Rhodococcus species N-774, which is composed of two subunits, alpha and beta, catalyzes the hydration of various nitrile compounds to the corresponding amides. The amino acid sequences of the NH2 termini and the fragments obtained by digesting each of the two subunits with lysyl endopeptidase were determined for preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides as hybridization probes. A 4.4-kb SphI fragment which contained DNA sequences hybridizing to several of the probes was cloned in pBR322 in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequences together with the determined amino acid sequences indicated that the alpha and beta subunits of NHase consisted of 207 amino acids (Mr, 22918) and 212 amino acids (Mr, 23428), respectively. The open reading frame for the alpha subunit includes that for the beta subunit with a short interval of only 26 base pairs; the two genes are probably translated in a polycistronic manner. Although large amounts of the alpha- and beta-subunit proteins were produced as insoluble forms in E. coli when the cloned genes were placed under the control of the lac promoter, no enzymatic activity was detected. The activity of the enzyme was restored, to some extent, by solubilization of the proteins with 8 M urea and subsequent dialysis for refolding at pH 10 in the presence of Fe2+ and pyrroloquinoline quinone.	1989 May	Ikehata O,Nishiyama M,Horinouchi S,Beppu T	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 181(3) 563-70	Nitrile hydratase	MSEHVNKYTEYEARTKAIETLLYERGLITPAAVDRVVSYYENEIGPMGGAKVVAKSWVDPEYRKWLEEDATAAMASLGYAGEQAHQISAVFNDSQTHHVVVCTLCSCYPWPVLGLPPAWYKSMEYRSRVVADPRGVLKRDFGFDIPDEVEVRVWDSSSEIRYIVIPERPAGTDGWSEDELAKLVSRDSMIGVSNALTPQEVIV		Q59786			10	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16095563	Conformational change in full-length mouse prion: a site-directed spin-labeling study.	The structure of the mouse prion (moPrP) was studied using site-directed spin-labeling electron spin resonance (SDSL-ESR). Since a previous NMR study by Hornemanna et al., [Hornemanna, Korthb, Oeschb, Rieka, Widera, Wüthricha, Glockshubera, Recombinant full-length murine prion protein, mPrP (23-231): purification and spectroscopic characterization, FEBS Lett. 413 (1997) 277-281] has indicated that N96, D143, and T189 in moPrP are localized in a Cu(2+) binding region, Helix1 and Helix2, respectively, three recombinant moPrP mutations (N96C, D143C, and T189C) were expressed in an Escherichia coli system, and then refolded by dialysis under low pH and purified by reverse-phase HPLC. By using the preparation, we succeeded in preserving a target cystein residue without alteration of the alpha-helix structure of moPrP and were able to apply SDSL-ESR with a methane thiosulfonate spin label to the full-length prion protein. The rotational correlation times (tau) of 1.1, 3.3, and 4.8ns were evaluated from the X-band ESR spectra at pH 7.4 and 20 degrees C for N96R1, D143R1, and T189R1, respectively. tau reflects the fact that the Cu(2+) binding region is more flexible than Helix1 or Helix2. ESR spectra recorded at various temperatures revealed two phases together with a transition point at around 20 degrees C in D143R1 and T189R1, but not in N96R1. With the variation of pH from 4.0 to 7.8, ESR spectra of T189R1 at 20 degrees C showed a gradual increase of tau from 2.9 to 4.8ns. On the other hand, the pH-dependent conformational changes in N96R1 and D143R1 were negligible. These results indicated that T189 located in Helix2 possessed a structure sensitive to physiological pH changes; simultaneously, N96 in the Cu(2+) binding region and D143 in Helix1 were conserved.	2005 Sep	Inanami Osamu,Hashida Shukichi,Iizuka Daisuke,Horiuchi Motohiro,Hiraoka Wakako,Shimoyama Yuhei,Nakamura Hideo,Inagaki Fuyuhiko,Kuwabara Mikinori	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 335(3) 785-92	Prion	KKRPKPGGWNTGGSRYPGQGSPGGNRYPPQGGTWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGSWGQPHGGSWGQPHGGGWGQGGGTHNQWNKPSKPKTNLKHVAGAAAAGAVVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPMIHFGNDWEDRYYRENMYRYPNQVYYRPVDQYSNQNNFVHDCVNITIKQHTVTTTTKGENFTETDVKMMERVVEQMCVTQYQKESQAYYDGRRS		P04925			4	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

DNA encoding the last 48 residues of the propart and the whole mature sequence of Plasmepsin II was inserted into the T7 dependent vector pET 3a for expression in E. coli.

Following solubilisation with urea, the zymogen was refolded and, after purification by ion-exchange chromatography, was autoactivated to generate mature Plasmepsin II. The ability of this enzyme to hydrolyse several chromogenic peptide substrates was examined; despite an overall identity of approximately 350 human renin, Plasmepsin II was not inhibited significantly by renin inhibitors.	1994 Sep	Hill J,Tyas L,Phylip L H,Kay J,Dunn B M,Berry C	FEBS letters. 352(2) 155-8	Plasmepsin 2	MDITVREHDFKHGFIKSNSTFDGLNIDNSKNKKKIQKGFQILYVLLFCSVMCGLFYYVYENVWLQRDNEMNEILKNSEHLTIGFKVENAHDRILKTIKTHKLKNYIKESVNFLNSGLTKTNYLGSSNDNIELVDFQNIMFYGDAEVGDNQQPFTFILDTGSANLWVPSVKCTTAGCLTKHLYDSSKSRTYEKDGTKVEMNYVSGTVSGFFSKDLVTVGNLSLPYKFIEVIDTNGFEPTYTASTFDGILGLGWKDLSIGSVDPIVVELKNQNKIENALFTFYLPVHDKHTGFLTIGGIEERFYEGPLTYEKLNHDLYWQITLDAHVGNIMLEKANCIVDSGTSAITVPTDFLNKMLQNLDVIKVPFLPFYVTLCNNSKLPTFEFTSENGKYTLEPEYYLQHIEDVGPGLCMLNIIGLDFPVPTFILGDPFMRKYFTVFDYDNQSVGIALAKKNL	N-terminal T7 tag	Q8I6V3			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
14529283	Bacterial expression, characterization, and disulfide bond determination of soluble human NTPDase6 (CD39L2) nucleotidase: implications for structure and function.	The ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) control extracellular nucleotide concentrations, thereby modulating many important biological responses, including blood clotting and pain perception. NTPDases1-4 are oligomeric integral membrane proteins, whereas NTPDase5 (CD39L4) and NTPDase6 (CD39L2) are soluble monomeric enzymes, making them more amenable to thorough structural and functional analyses than the membrane-bound forms. Therefore, we report here the bacterial expression, refolding, purification, and biochemical characterization of the soluble portion of human NTPDase6. Consistent with the enzyme expressed in mammalian cells, this recombinant NTPDase6 efficiently hydrolyzes GDP, IDP, and UDP (specific activity of approximately 50000 micromol mg(-1) h(-1)), with slower hydrolysis of CDP, ITP, GTP, CTP, ADP, and UTP and virtually no hydrolysis of ATP. The K(m) for GDP (130 +/- 30 microM) is similar to that determined for the soluble rat NTPDase6 expressed in mammalian cells. The secondary structure of the refolded enzyme was determined by circular dichroism to be 33% alpha-helix, 180eta-sheet, and 49% random coil, consistent with the secondary structure predicted from the amino acid sequence of soluble NTPDase6. Four of the five cysteine residues in the soluble NTPDase6 are highly conserved among all the NTPDases, while the fifth residue is not. Mutation of this nonconserved cysteine resulted in an enzyme very similar to wild type in its enzymology and secondary structure, indicating that this cysteine exists as a free sulfhydryl and is not essential for structure or function. The disulfide pairing of the other four cysteine residues was determined as Cys(249)-Cys(280) and Cys(340)-Cys(354) by HPLC and mass spectral analysis of tryptic peptides. Due to conservation of these cysteine residues, these two disulfide bonds are likely to exist in all NTPDases. A structural model for NTPDase6, incorporating these and other findings obtained with other NTPDases, is proposed.	2003 Oct	Ivanenkov Vasily V,Murphy-Piedmonte Deirdre M,Kirley Terence L	Biochemistry. 42(40) 11726-35	Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 6 (CD39L2)	MKKGIRYETSRKTSYIFQQPQHGPWQTRMRKISNHGSLRVAKVAYPLGLCVGVFIYVAYIKWHRATATQAFFSITRAAPGARWGQQAHSPLGTAADGHEVFYGIMFDAGSTGTRVHVFQFTRPPRETPTLTHETFKALKPGLSAYADDVEKSAQGIRELLDVAKQDIPFDFWKATPLVLKATAGLRLLPGEKAQKLLQKVKEVFKASPFLVGDDCVSIMNGTDEGVSAWITINFLTGSLKTPGGSSVGMLDLGGGSTQIAFLPRVEGTLQASPPGYLTALRMFNRTYKLYSYSYLGLGLMSARLAILGGVEGQPAKDGKELVSPCLSPSFKGEWEHAEVTYRVSGQKAAASLHELCAARVSEVLQNRVHRTEEVKHVDFYAFSYYYDLAAGVGLIDAEKGGSLVVGDFEIAAKYVCRTLETQPQSSPFSCMDLTYVSLLLQEFGFPRSKVLKLTRKIDNVETSWALGAIFHYIDSLNRQKSPAS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O75354			8.35	23	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
16230023	Novel immunotoxin: a fusion protein consisting of gelonin and an acetylcholine receptor fragment as a potential immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of Myasthenia gravis.	In continuation of our attempts for antigen-specific suppression of the immune system [I.L. Urbatsch, R.K.M. Sterz, K. Peper, W.E. Trommer, Eur. J. Immunol. 23(1993) 776-779] a novel fusion protein composed of amino acids 4-181 of the extracellular domain of the alpha-subunit of the human muscle acetylcholine receptor and the plant toxin gelonin was expressed in Escherichia coli. The fusion protein formed inclusion bodies but could be solubilized in the presence of guanidinium hydrochloride. After a simple two step purification and refolding procedure, it exhibited a native structure at least in the main immunogenic region as shown by antibodies recognizing a conformational epitope. Half maximal inhibition of translation was achieved at 46 ng/ml as compared to 4.6 ng/ml for native and 2.4 for recombinant gelonin. Its use as therapeutic agent for the treatment of Myasthenia gravis was investigated in an animal model. Female Lewis rats were immunized with complete acetylcholine receptor from the electric ray Torpedo californica and developed thereafter experimental autoimmune M. gravis. Quantitative assessment of the disease was achieved by repetitive stimulation of the Nervus tibialis. Rats showed no symptoms of M. gravis, neither visually nor electrophysiologically after treatment with the fusion protein as determined one and seven weeks after the second application. This approach may also be useful for the therapy of further autoimmune diseases by substituting other autoantigens for the AchR fragment in the fusion protein.	2006 Mar	Hossann Martin,Li Zhuoyu,Shi Yawei,Kreilinger Ulrike,Büttner Jörn,Vogel Pia D,Yuan Jingming,Wise John G,Trommer Wolfgang E	Protein expression and purification. 46(1) 73-84	Gelonin-acetylcholine receptor alpha sub unit	GLDTVSFSTKGATYITYVNFLNELRVKLKPEGNSHGIPLLRKKCDDPGKCFVLVALSNDNGQLAEIAIDVTSVYVVGYQVRNRSYFFKDAPDAAYEGLFKNTIKTRLHFGGSYPSLEGEKAYRETTDLGIEPLRIGIKKLDENAIDNYKPTEIASSLLVVIQMVSEAARFTFIENQIRNNFQQRIRPANNTISLENKWGKLSFQIRTSGANGMFSEAVELERANGKKYYVTAVDQVKPKIALLKFVETRLVANLLENYNKVIRPVEHHTHFVDITVGLQLIQLISVDEVNQIVETNVRLRQQWIDVRLRWNPADYGGIKKIRLPSDDVWLPDLVLYNNADGDFAIVHMTKLLLDYGKIMWTPPAIFKSYCEIIVTHFPFDQQNCTMKLGIWTYDGTKVSISPESDRPDLSTFMESGEEWVIKESLSNN	N-terminal hexahistidine tag				8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16112459	Purification, characterization, cDNA cloning, and expression of asialofetuin-binding C-type lectin from eggs of shishamo smelt (Osmerus [Spirinchus] lanceolatus).	A novel C-type lectin (OLABL) was isolated from the eggs of shishamo smelt [Osmerus (Spirinchus) lanceolatus] by affinity chromatography on asialofetuin-Sepharose. OLABL had a molecular mass of 29 kDa on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and two subunits with masses of 15 kDa (OLABL-H) and 14 kDa (OLABL-L) under reducing conditions. Thus, OLABL is a heterodimeric protein. cDNA sequence analysis revealed that the H- and L-subunits of OLABL were composed of 137 and 136 amino acid residues, respectively, and showed almost identical (95%) sequences, with slight differences in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Since each subunit contained only the characteristic motif of C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD), EPN-E-WND, OLABL is a member of group VII of the CTLD-containing protein family. Although OLABL had an EPN sequence that is known as a mannose-specific motif found in the collectin family, OLABL agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes without the addition of Ca(2+) ion, and this activity was inhibited by l-rhamnose and d-galactose derivatives, but not by d-mannose and d-glucose. These results indicate that OLABL has similar characteristics to AJL-2, a calcium-independent lactose specific lectin isolated from Japanese eel skin mucus. Recombinant OLABLs (rHisOLABLs), His-tagged homodimers of the H- and L-subunits, were refolded from inclusion bodies expressed by Escherichia coli. rHisOLABL-L was recovered as a soluble form, but rHisOLABL-H was hardly dissolved in a renaturing buffer. The specific activities of rHisOLABL-L, rHisOLABL-H, and native OLABL were 500, 36, and 20, respectively. These findings suggest that the combination of subunits may affect the solubility and activity of these dimeric form lectins.	2005 Sep	Hosono Masahiro,Sugawara Shigeki,Ogawa Yukiko,Kohno Takayuki,Takayanagi Motoaki,Nitta Kazuo	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1725(2) 160-73	C-type lectin also known as asialofetuin-binding C-type`	SYPSCPSRQWTKNGQRCYLSVSAPNNWVGAEQYCLRQGANLASVHSFSEYTFLQQLVGSESNGHPVTWIGGTDAFQDRVWFWSDGSSFDYAAWAAGEPNNYGGRREPCIEMNWGADHRWNDSPCDNKRGFICSFKLC	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q3LHY4			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16232802	Direct refolding of recombinant human growth differentiation factor 5 for large-scale production process.	An efficient downstream process for the production of recombinant human growth differentiation factor 5 (rhGDF5) has been developed for industrial application utilizing a novel &quot;direct refolding&quot; method. In this method, the starting material is an inclusion body produced in Escherichia coli, and the critical step is the direct refolding step that follows directly after solubilization of the inclusion body. rhGDF5 can be refolded at a markedly high concentration of 2.4 mg.ml(-1), which is 24 times that hitherto achieved by the proteins of the TGF-beta superfamily. The refolding yield is 63%, and after purification by diafiltration, isoelectric precipitation and reverse-phase chromatography, the final purification yield is 20% with purity higher than 99%. The yield is more than twice that of a conventionally established process having three chromatography steps and the purity is equivalent. The first pilot-scale trial shows a refolding yield of 51% and a final yield of 11%. The final yield is 1.4 times that of the conventional process, and further optimization at pilot-scale is expected to bring this figure up to or above that of laboratory-scale. As a result, the calculated production cost of rhGDF5 has been reduced dramatically. This type of efficient and simple process is beneficial particularly in the large-scale production of recombinant proteins in which high yield and quality are required.	2000 	Honda J,Andou H,Mannen T,Sugimoto S	Journal of bioscience and bioengineering. 89(6) 582-9	Growth/differentiation factor 5	APLATRQGKRPSKNLKARCSRKALHVNFKDMGWDDWIIAPLEYEAFHCEGLCEFPLRSHLEPTNHAVIQTLMNSMDPESTPPTCCVPTRLSPISILFIDSANNVVYKQYEDMVVESCGCR		P43026			8.9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11281710	Solution studies of recombinant human stromal-cell-derived factor-1.	Stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1alpha) is an 8-kDa chemokine that is constitutively expressed in bone-marrow-derived stromal cells and has been identified as a ligand for the CXCR4 receptor. We produced the chemokine recombinantly as methionine-SDF-1alpha in Escherichia coli without the leader peptide sequence. The protein was denatured, refolded, and further purified by reversed-phase HPLC. SDF-1alpha was shown to be &gt;95d0c850ure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The final yield of purified and refolded SDF-1alpha was 1-2 mg per gram of wet cell paste. The refolded protein is a ligand for the CXCR4 receptor and has been used to block HIV-mediated cell fusion and downmodulates the CXCR4 receptor. Our ability to purify hundreds of milligrams of refolded protein allowed us to conduct detailed studies of the biophysical properties of the protein. We have used a combination of biophysical techniques to study the solution properties of SDF-1alpha. The average mass of SDF-1alpha, as determined by static light scattering, gave us the first indications that the chemokine may self-associate. Further investigation with sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation confirmed the existence of two species. The measured s(20, W) values defined two masses corresponding to monomer and dimer. Finally, sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation and dynamic light scattering yielded a composite value of 150 +/- 30 microM for the dimerization constant. We conclude that SDF-1alpha exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium.	2001 Apr	Holmes W D,Consler T G,Dallas W S,Rocque W J,Willard D H	Protein expression and purification. 21(3) 367-77	Stromal cell-derived factor-1a	VSLSYRCPCRFFESHVARANVKHLKILNTPNCALQIVARLKNNNRQVCIDPKLKWIQEYLEKALN		P48061			8	22	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9619369	Expression of active thrombopoietin and identification of its key residues responsible for receptor binding.	In this report expression of the biologically active N-terminal half (amino acids 1-153) of thrombopoietin (TPO153) in Escherichia coli is described and the structure-function relationships in TPO are explored. TPO153 was chosen for expression because of its full biological activity. Since natural TPO153 cDNA expressed poorly, synthetic cDNA was constructed with a unique polymerase chain reaction to enhance the expression. In addition, the 5&#39;-end codons of the synthetic cDNA were altered to maximize the expression. The expressed TPO153 was refolded and then purified to homogeneity. The protein is biologically active, and interestingly, the EC50 of this protein is 8-10-fold smaller in a TPO-dependent cell proliferation assay than that of full-length wild-type TPO. In order to identify the amino acid residues that are involved in the interaction between TPO and its receptor, all charged residues and some of the uncharged residues on the four putative helices of TPO were mutated and biological activities of the mutant proteins were examined. The mutagenesis studies suggest that there are at least two clusters of residues that are vital for TPO to be able to interact with its receptor. These residues are centred respectively around arginine 10 on helix 1 and around lysine 138 on helix IV. The successful expression of the protein in E. coli will greatly facilitate biochemical and crystallographic studies of TPO, and the structure-function relationship studies suggest that TPO has two binding sites which may interact with two individual receptors, resulting in dimerization of the receptors.	1998 May	Hou J,Zhan H	Cytokine. 10(5) 319-30	Thrombopoietin	SPAPPACDLRVLSKLLRDSHVLHSRLSQCPEVHPLPTPVLLPAVDFSLGEWKTQMEETKAQDILGAVTLLLEGVMAARGQLGPTCLSSLLGQLSGQVRLLLGALQSLLGTQLPPQGRTTAHKDPNAIFLSFQHLLRGKVRFLMLVGGSTLCVRR		P40225			6.5	0	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
13679369	Enzymic, phylogenetic, and structural characterization of the unusual papain-like protease domain of Plasmodium falciparum SERA5.	Serine repeat antigen 5 (SERA5) is an abundant antigen of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum and is the most strongly expressed member of the nine-gene SERA family. It appears to be essential for the maintenance of the erythrocytic cycle, unlike a number of other members of this family, and has been implicated in parasite egress and/or erythrocyte invasion. All SERA proteins possess a central domain that has homology to papain except in the case of SERA5 (and some other SERAs), where the active site cysteine has been replaced with a serine. To investigate if this domain retains catalytic activity, we expressed, purified, and refolded a recombinant form of the SERA5 enzyme domain. This protein possessed chymotrypsin-like proteolytic activity as it processed substrates downstream of aromatic residues, and its activity was reversed by the serine protease inhibitor 3,4-diisocoumarin. Although all Plasmodium SERA enzyme domain sequences share considerable homology, phylogenetic studies revealed two distinct clusters across the genus, separated according to whether they possess an active site serine or cysteine. All Plasmodia appear to have at least one member of each group. Consistent with separate biological roles for members of these two clusters, molecular modeling studies revealed that SERA5 and SERA6 enzyme domains have dramatically different surface properties, although both have a characteristic papain-like fold, catalytic cleft, and an appropriately positioned catalytic triad. This study provides impetus for the examination of SERA5 as a target for antimalarial drug design.	2003 Nov	Hodder Anthony N,Drew Damien R,Epa V Chandana,Delorenzi Mauro,Bourgon Richard,Miller Susanne K,Moritz Robert L,Frecklington David F,Simpson Richard J,Speed Terence P,Pike Robert N,Crabb Brendan S	The Journal of biological chemistry. 278(48) 48169-77	Serine-repeat antigen protein	TEDDDEDDYTEYKLTESIDNILVKMFKTNENNDKSELIKLEEVDDSLKLELMNYCSLLKDVDTTGTLDNYGMGNEMDIFNNLKRLLIYHSEENINTLKNKFRNAAVCLKNVDDWIVNKRGLVLPELNYDLEYFNEHLYNDKNSPEDKDNKGKGVVHVDTTLEKEDTLSYDNSDNMFCNKEYCNRLKDENNCISNLQVEDQGNCDTSWIFASKYHLETIRCMKGYEPTKISALYVANCYKGEHKDRCDEGSSPMEFLQIIEDYGFLPAESNYPYNYVKVGEQCPKVEDHWMNLWDNGKILHNKNEPNSLDGKGYTAYESERFHDNMDAFVKIIKTEVMNKGSVIAYIKAENVMGYEFSGKKVQNLCGDDTADHAVNIVGYGNYVNSEGEKKSYWIVRNSWGPYWGDEGYFKVDMYGPTHCHFNFIHSVVIFNVDLPMNN		Q9TY95		SERA5	8	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16289919	Prokaryotic expression, purification, and polyclonal antibody production against a novel drug resistance gene of Leishmania donovani clinical isolate.	Diseases produced by protozoan parasites are one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality around the world, affecting millions of people. Among these, leishmaniasis has become the second most common cause of death and the problem is further complicated by the expansion of parasite resistance to the conventional drugs. The high rate of therapeutic failure thus calls for new rational approaches to develop alternative drugs. Understanding resistance mechanisms may help identify new targets for drug development. So we present here the cloning, expression, purification, and antibody production of a gene implicated in imparting resistance to pentavalent antimony (SbV) in clinical isolates of kala azar with a view to gain insight into the novel mechanism of its drug resistance.	2006 Jan	Kothari Hema,Kumar Pranav,Singh Neeloo	Protein expression and purification. 45(1) 15-21	Serine-repeat antigen protein	MSNRFFQKFYLRCGNCTAIQRSAQGYKPIANPILFKSDEHCRNYHDEQRRAAGYAGMMVTTRCDKCNRVHSNWKVLDAQEFLDVKLSLTPAERTKRLWASSK	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9NB19			8	0	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9322755	Cloning, expression and activation of a truncated 92-kDa gelatinase minienzyme.	The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of highly homologous zinc-endopeptidases that degrade extracellular matrix components. Human 92-kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) represents one of the MMPs that cleaves native collagen type IV. As a basis for structural investigations, the short form (catalytic domain, amino acid residues 113-450) of the 92-kDa gelatinase cDNA was cloned and expressed in E. coli as a minienzyme. By combination of reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the truncated 92-kDa gelatinase-cDNA was amplified from the corresponding mRNA derived from ovarian carcinoma cells. The cDNA fragment obtained was cloned in E. coli and sequenced. With the exception of one nucleotide inversion at position 745 (gt--&gt;tg) the cDNA sequence was identical to the nucleotide sequence of the 92-kDa gelatinase as has been previously reported. The protein was expressed in E. coli using the vector pET-12b. The recombinant protein was stored in inclusion bodies and extracted as a 38 kDa species from the inclusion bodies by solubilization in 8 M urea. The product was purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Amino-terminal sequence analysis confirmed the identity with the catalytic domain of 92-kDa gelatinase. The recombinant protein was refolded in the presence of Ca2+ and Zn2+ and yielded an active minienzyme with gelatinolytic activity. It degrades the native substrate collagen type IV and the synthetic substrate Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 x AcOH like the full-length 92-kDa gelatinase. The catalytic activity could be inhibited by the specific MMP inhibitors TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.	1997 Sep	Kröger M,Tschesche H	Gene. 196(1-2) 175-80	Gelatinase B also known as Matrix metalloproteinase-9 &amp; 92 kDa gelatinase	ITYWIQNYSEDLPRAVIDDAFARAFALWSAVTPLTFTRVYSRDADIVIQFGVAEHGDGYPFDGKDGLLAHAFPPGPGIQGDAHFDDDELWSLGKGVVVPTRFGNADGAACHFPFIFEGRSYSACTTDGRSDGLPWCSTTANYDTDDRFGFCPSERLYTRDGNADGKPCQFPFIFQGQSYSACTTDGRSDGYRWCATTANYDRDKLFGFCPTRADSTVMGGNSAGELCVFPFTFLGKEYSTCTSEGRGDGRLWCATTSNFDSDKKWGFCPDQGYSLFLVAAHEFGHALGLDHSSVPEALMYPMYRFTEGPPLHKDDVNGIRHLYGPRPEPE	N-terminal methionine	P14780		amino acid residues 113-450		0	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12147358	In vitro reconstitution of the spinach chloroplast cytochrome b6 protein from a fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli.	We have developed a strategy for overproduction of spinach apocytochrome b6 as a fusion protein to maltose-binding protein (MBP) in Escherichia coli, using the expression vector pMal-c2. The fusion protein was purified to virtual homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography and the method of insertion of hemes into fusion protein was elaborated. The ambient and low-temperature absorption spectra of the reconstituted cytochrome b6 were similar to those of cytochrome b6 spectra in isolated proteins or cytochrome b6f complexes and are typical for bis-histidine ligated b-type cytochromes. Optical circular dichroism (CD) spectra of the visible region further confirmed the appropriate binding of hemes by the apocytochrome b6 protein. We found that the incorporation of hemes was required for the refolding of the cytochrome b6 protein into the more compact structure found in the native cytochrome protein. Heme staining experiments suggested that the two hemes in the reconstituted cytochrome b6 protein are bound with different affinities. The reconstituted cytochrome b6 protein was cleaved by Xa factor proteolysis from fusion protein and separated for characterization. The procedure presented in this work for reconstitution of hemes into the cytochrome b6 protein should provide an important tool for structure/function studies of membrane-bound cytochrome proteins.	2002 Jul	Króliczewski Jarosław,Szczepaniak Andrzej	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1598(1-2) 177-84	Cytochrome b6	MSKVYDWFEERLEIQAIADDITSKYVPPHVNIFYCLGGITLTCFLVQVATGFAMTFYYRPTVTDAFASVQYIMTEVNFGWLIRSVHRWSASMMVLMMILHVFRVYLTGGFKKPRELTWVTGVVLGVLTASFGVTGYSLPWDQIGYWAVKIVTGVPDAIPVIGSPLVELLRGSASVGQSTLTRFYSLHTFVLPLLTAVFMLMHFLMIRKQGISGPL		P00165			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

A refolding strategy was described for on-column refolding of recombinant human interferon-gamma (rhIFN-gamma) inclusion bodies by expanded bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography. After the denatured rhIFN-gamma protein bound onto the cation exchanger of STREAMLINE SP, the refolding process was performed in expanded bed by gradually decreasing the concentration of urea in the buffer and the refolded rhIFN-gamma protein was recovered by the elution in packed bed mode. It was demonstrated that the denatured rhIFN-gamma protein could be efficiently refolded by this method with high yield. Under appropriate experimental conditions, the protein yield and specific activity of rhIFN-gamma was up to 52.7% and 8.18 x 10(6) IU/mg, respectively.	2006 Mar	Jin Ting,Guan Yi-Xin,Yao Shan-Jing,Lin Dong-Qiang,Cho Man-Gi	Biotechnology and bioengineering. 93(4) 755-60	Interferon gamma	QDPYVKEAENLKKYFNAGHSDVADNGTLFLGILKNWKEESDRKIMQSQIVSFYFKLFKNFKDDQSIQKSVETIKEDMNVKFFNSNKKKRDDFEKLTNYSVTDLNVQRKAIHELIQVMAELSPAAKTGKRKRSQMLFRG		P01579			7.5	0	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14976985	Beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein-2 (betaGRP-2)from Manduca sexta; an acute-phase protein that binds beta-1,3-glucan and lipoteichoic acid to aggregate fungi and bacteria and stimulate prophenoloxidase activation.	We have isolated and characterized a new beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein that is present in Manduca sexta cuticle and hemolymph. This 52 kDa protein, designated betaGRP-2, is 57 0dentical in sequence to betaGRP-1 from larval hymolymph of the same insect. BetaGRP-2 differs from betaGRP-1 in its absence of the naive larvae before the wandering stage begins. Transcription of the betaGRP-2 was up-regulated in larvae challenged with yeast or bacteria. BetaGRP-2 contains a region with sequence similarity to several glucanases but lacks glucanase activity. It aggregates yeasts and bacteria to, perhaps, limit the spread of invading cells and ensure a localized defense reaction. BetaGRP-2 binds laminarin and lipoteichoic acid, but not lipopolysaccharide. Laminarin-triggered prophenoloxidase activation was greatly enhanced in the induced larval hemolymph supplemented with purified betaGRP-2. Complementing other studies on pattern recognition molecules in M. sexta, these results indicate that a complex system of protein sensors is an integral component of the insect immune system and that different recognition molecules have overlapping binding specificity and functions.	2004 Jan	Jiang Haobo,Ma Congcong,Lu Zhi-Qiang,Kanost Michael R	Insect biochemistry and molecular biology. 34(1) 89-100	Beta-1,3-glucan recognition protein 2 also known as BetaGRP-2	RGGPYKVPDAKLEAIYPKGLRVSVPDDGYSLFAFHGKLNEEMEGLEAGHWSRDITKAKQGRWIFRDRNAELKLGDKIYFWTYVIKDGLGYRQDNGEWTVTEFVNENGTVVDTSTAPPPVAPAVSEEDQSPGPQWRPCERSLTESLARERVCKGSLVFSEDFDGSSLADLGNWTAEVRFPGEPDYPYNLYTTDGTVGFESGSLVVRPVMTESKYHEGIIYDRLDLERCTGQLGTLECRRESSGGQIVPPVMTAKLATRRSFAFKFGRIDIKAKMPRGDWLIPELNLEPLDNIYGNQRYASGLMRVAFVRGNDVYAKKLYGGPIMSDADPFRSMLLKDKQGLANWNNDYHVYSLLWKPNGLELMVDGEVYGTIDAGDGFYQIAKNNLVSHASQWLKGTVMAPFDEKFFITLGLRVAGIHDFTDGPGKPWENKGTKAMINFWNNRFRWFPTWHDTSLKVDYVRVYAL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8ISB6			6.8	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2670934	Cloning and expression of a synthetic gene for Cerebratulus lacteus neurotoxin B-IV.	A synthetic gene encoding Cerebratulus lacteus neurotoxin B-IV has been designed, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Although expression of the toxin alone appears to be incompatible with host viability, large amounts could be synthesized as a fusion protein with either E. coli beta-galactosidase or the gene 9 protein of bacteriophage T7, the latter system being the more efficient. The fusion protein has been purified, and, after Factor Xa-catalyzed hydrolysis at a customized linker site, we have obtained the equivalent of 12 mg of pure toxin B-IV per liter of bacterial culture. The recombinant protein is identical with B-IV isolated from Cerebratulus with respect to high performance liquid chromatography mobility and secondary structure, and its amino acid composition differs only by the presence of an amino-terminal methionine residue and replacement of Hyp10 by Pro. Quantal bioassay indicates that the cloned protein is comparable to the natural toxin in specific toxicity. The small differences observed in comparing the activities of the two proteins are most likely due to the presence of the methionine extension at the amino terminus of the recombinant, although lack of hydroxylation of Pro10 may also contribute.	1989 Sep	Howell M L,Blumenthal K M	The Journal of biological chemistry. 264(26) 15268-73	Neurotoxin B-IV	ASATWGAAYPACENNCRKKYDLCIRCQGKWAGKRGKCAAHCIIQKNNCKGKCKKE	C-terminal T7 tag	P01525			8.3	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7764497	Purification and renaturation of recombinant human lymphotoxin (tumour necrosis factor beta) expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies.	High level expression of recombinant human tumour necrosis factor beta (rhTNF-beta) in Escherichia coli results in the formation of two portions of protein, namely soluble active protein and insoluble protein which is inactive and aggregates in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs). In this study, a procedure for purification and renaturation of rhTNF-beta from inclusion bodies has been designed and verified experimentally with a product purity of more than 90% and a recovery of about 30%. The procedure includes washing of IBs with specific wash buffer (Triton X-100/EDTA/lysozyme/PMSF), their solubilization with 8 mol dm-3 alkaline urea, purification with ion-exchange columns, refolding with renaturation buffer and finally concentration and desalination with an ultrafiltration membrane.

10940560	Genetic engineering of Escherichia coli to produce a 1:1 complex of the anabaena sp. PCC 7120 nuclease NucA and its inhibitor NuiA.	A series of T7-promoter based bicistronic expression vectors was constructed in order to produce the complex of the Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 DNA/RNA non-specific nuclease NucA and its inhibitor NuiA. With all constructs, tandem expression of nucA and nuiA results in aggregation and inclusion body formation of NucA, independent of the order of the genes, the relative expression of the two proteins and the temperature applied during expression. Two constructs in which nuiA is the first and nucA the second cistron lead to an approximately one order of magnitude higher expression of nuiA compared with nucA. In these cells inclusion bodies are formed which contain NucA and NuiA in a 1:1 molar ratio. The complex can be solubilized with 6M urea after disruption of the cells by sonication, renatured by dialysis and purified to homogeneity. 2mg of the complex are obtained from 1l Escherichia coli culture. As shown by gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation, our system leads to a highly pure and homogeneous complex preparation, as required for biophysical and structural studies. Thus, our new method is a superior alternative for the production of the NucA/NuiA complex in which separately produced nuclease and inhibitor are mixed, and an excess of one or the other component, as well as aggregates of NucA, have to be removed from the preparation.	2000 Aug	Korn C,Meiss G,Gast F,Gimadutdinow O,Urbanke C,Pingoud A	Gene. 253(2) 221-9	Nuclease	QVPPLTELSPSISVHLLLGNPSGATPTKLTPDNYLMVKNQYALSYNNSKGTANWVAWQLNSSWLGNAERQDNFRPDKTLPAGWVRVTPSMYSGSGYDRGHIAPSADRTKTTEDNAATFLMTNMMPQTPDNNRNTWGNLEDYCRELVSQGKELYIVAGPNGSLGKPLKGKVTVPKSTWKIVVVLDSPGSGLEGITANTRVIAVNIPNDPELNNDWRAYKVSVDELESLTGYDFLSNVSPNIQTSIESKVDN	N-terminal GST	P38446			8.2	0	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
16025134	The structure of the TRAPP subunit TPC6 suggests a model for a TRAPP subcomplex.	The TRAPP (transport protein particle) complexes are tethering complexes that have an important role at the different steps of vesicle transport. Recently, the crystal structures of the TRAPP subunits SEDL and BET3 have been determined, and we present here the 1.7 Angstroms crystal structure of human TPC6, a third TRAPP subunit. The protein adopts an alpha/beta-plait topology and forms a dimer. In spite of low sequence similarity, the structure of TPC6 strikingly resembles that of BET3. The similarity is especially prominent at the dimerization interfaces of the proteins. This suggests heterodimerization of TPC6 and BET3, which is shown by in vitro and in vivo association studies. Together with TPC5, another TRAPP subunit, TPC6 and BET3 are supposed to constitute a family of paralogous proteins with closely similar three-dimensional structures but little sequence similarity among its members.	2005 Aug	Kümmel Daniel,Müller Jürgen J,Roske Yvette,Misselwitz Rolf,Büssow Konrad,Heinemann Udo	EMBO reports. 6(8) 787-93	Trafficking protein particle complex subunit 6A	MADTVLFEFLHTEMVAELWAHDPDPGPGGQKMSLSVLEGMGFRVGQALGERLPRETLAFREELDVLKFLCKDLWVAVFQKQMDSLRTNHQGTYVLQDNSFPLLLPMASGLQYLEEAPKFLAFTCGLLRGALYTLGIESVVTASVAALPVCKFQVIPKS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O75865				0	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
11237694	Expression, purification, and characterization of the active immunoglobulin-like domain of human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor in Escherichia coli.	We succeeded in the expression, purification, and refolding of the immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain of human granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor with amino-terminal His-tag in Escherichia coli. The refolded Ig domain bound to a G-CSF affinity column and could be eluted with free G-CSF as a receptor-ligand complex, demonstrating that the Ig domain has the information necessary for binding its ligand, G-CSF. The eluted His-Ig/G-CSF complex could be separated from excess G-CSF by Ni-NTA column chromatography. The yield of this active recombinant His-Ig protein is about 0.72 mg per liter of culture. Its small size and the ease of production make this receptor fragment a useful reagent for the structural analysis of its complex with G-CSF.	2001 Mar	Ishibashi M,Tokunaga H,Arakawa T,Tokunaga M	Protein expression and purification. 21(2) 317-22	Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor	ATPLGPASSLPQSFLLKCLEQVRKIQGDGAALQEKLVSECATYKLCHPEELVLLGHSLGIPWAPLSSCPSQALQLAGCLSQLHSGLFLYQGLLQALEGISPELGPTLDTLQLDVADFATTIWQQMEELGMAPALQPTQGAMPAFASAFQRRAGGVLVASHLQSFLEVSYRVLRHLAQP	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P09919			8	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10406963	Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a snake venom metalloprotease.	A cDNA clone, MT-d, encoding metalloprotease precursor was isolated from snake (Agkistrodon halys brevicaudus) venom gland cDNA library. MT-d-I protein containing both metalloprotease and disintegrin domains, and MT-d-II protein containing the metalloprotease domain only were expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded successfully into their functional forms. Each of the refolded enzyme species exhibited distinct substrate specificity. Proteolytic activity of the MT-d-1 was able to hydrolyse type I gelatin, type-III and V collagens in contrast with the catalytic function of MT-d-II. MT-d-I protein having metalloprotease activity was also able to inhibit platelet aggregation. Functionally active MT-d-I protein underwent autoproteolytic processing in vitro to produce metalloprotease and disintegrin; this processing was accompanied by significant changes in the substrate specificity of the enzyme activity. Experimental evidence strongly suggests that the disintegrin domain in the metalloprotease precursor modulates the catalytic function of the enzyme in hydrolysing extracellular matrix proteins.	1999 Jul	Jeon O H,Kim D S	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 263(2) 526-33	metalloprotease also know as Zinc metalloproteinase/disintegrin	PAHQRYIELVIVADHGMFTKYNGDSDKIREWVRQMVNTVDEIYSYMYIDVALAGLEIWSNEDLINVQPAAPHTLDSFGKWRERDLLHRIHHDNAMLLTAIDFDGPTIGLAYVGTMCKPKGSTGVVQDHSTINLRVAVTMAHEIGHNLGIHHDTGSCSCGGYSCIMSPVISHEPSKYFSDCSYTQCWDFIMNQKPQCILNKPPLRTDTVSTPVSGNELLEAGEECDCGSPGNPCCDAATCKLRQGAQCAEGLCCDQCRFMKEGTICRRARGDDLDDYCNGISAGCPRNPFHA	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q90WC0			7.5	0	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18333624	Preparation, characterization and refolding in vitro of a recombinant human cyclophilin A mutant: effect of a single Pro/Ser substitution on cyclophilin A structure and properties.	A recombinant cyclophilin A (CypA) mutant, which carries a serine instead of proline at sequence 16, was prepared for structural and functional assessment for human CypA. Soluble expression of the recombinant CypA mutant in E. coli was obtained under 30 degrees C, 180 rpm culture condition after being induced by IPTG. Ion exchange chromatography was used to purify the CypA mutant in a single step, and a high activity recovery of target protein with a high purity was achieved. Peptide fragments produced by trypsin proteolysis were applied to MALDI-TOF-MS, and searching results from the NCBI protein databank confirmed the protein attribution as well as the mutation sequence. Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity was assayed for the CypA mutant using tetrapeptide substrate Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide, and the calculated kcat/Km value was 1.5 x 106 M-1 s-1 at 10 degrees C, which was 10-fold lower than the previously reported constant for wild-type CypA. An Eyring plot was also carried out. Inhibition by cyclosporine A demonstrated that the IC50 value was 26.5 nM. Meanwhile the expected enhancement of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was quenched by the mutation. The effect of CypA mutant on accelerating protein refolding in vitro was investigated in ribonuclease A refolding process, and it was found that 10low phase could be catalyzed by CypA. The protein was subject to urea and GdmCl denaturation, where both activity and fluorescence served as structural probes. Activity recovery indicated this CypA mutant was extremely sensitive to GdmCl and the susceptibility to urea was increased. Low pH could also destabilize CypA. Furthermore the refolding of this CypA mutant itself was studied. Although the activity yield was nearly unchanged, the former proposed folding/assembly pathway might be altered. Fluorescence chart also demonstrated that the folding time was extended, and fast-folding and slow-folding analysis indicated the slow-folding rate constant presented a concentration dependence property denoting the autocatalysis of the foldase.

12837779	Crystal structure of a putative methyltransferase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis: misannotation of a genome clarified by protein structural analysis.	Bioinformatic analyses of whole genome sequences highlight the problem of identifying the biochemical and cellular functions of many gene products that are at present uncharacterized. The open reading frame Rv3853 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been annotated as menG and assumed to encode an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase that catalyzes the final step in menaquinone biosynthesis. The Rv3853 gene product has been expressed, refolded, purified, and crystallized in the context of a structural genomics program. Its crystal structure has been determined by isomorphous replacement and refined at 1.9 A resolution to an R factor of 19.0% and R(free) of 22.0%. The structure strongly suggests that this protein is not a SAM-dependent methyltransferase and that the gene has been misannotated in this and other genomes that contain homologs. The protein forms a tightly associated, disk-like trimer. The monomer fold is unlike that of any known SAM-dependent methyltransferase, most closely resembling the phosphohistidine domains of several phosphotransfer systems. Attempts to bind cofactor and substrate molecules have been unsuccessful, but two adventitiously bound small-molecule ligands, modeled as tartrate and glyoxalate, are present on each monomer. These may point to biologically relevant binding sites but do not suggest a function. In silico screening indicates a range of ligands that could occupy these and other sites. The nature of these ligands, coupled with the location of binding sites on the trimer, suggests that proteins of the Rv3853 family, which are distributed throughout microbial and plant species, may be part of a larger assembly binding to nucleic acids or proteins.	2003 Jul	Johnston Jodie M,Arcus Vickery L,Morton Craig J,Parker Michael W,Baker Edward N	Journal of bacteriology. 185(14) 4057-65	Regulator of ribonuclease activity A (gene RV3853)	MAISFRPTADLVDDIGPDVRSCDLQFRQFGGRSQFAGPISTVRCFQDNALLKSVLSQPSAGGVLVIDGAGSLHTALVGDVIAELARSTGWTGLIVHGAVRDAAALRGIDIGIKALGTNPRKSTKTGAGERDVEITLGGVTFVPGDIAYSDDDGIIVV	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P0A666			8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15604787	High level production of bovine angiogenin in E. coli by an efficient refolding procedure.	Recombinant bovine angiogenin (rbAng) was expressed in E. coli at up to 300f total cell proteins but was produced as inclusion bodies. By investigating the effect of various factors on the refolding yield, we obtained about 60% refolding. After chromatographic purification, about 60 mg purified angiogenin was obtained from 1 l culture. The purified recombinant bovine angiogenin was identical to native bovine angiogenin (nbAng) obtained from cow&#39;s milk. Our approach is highly efficient and can be generally used for the production of various types of angiogenin for functional and structural studies as well as therapeutic purposes.	2004 Oct	Jang Seung-Hwan,Kang Dong-Ku,Chang Soo-Ik,Scheraga Harold A,Shin Hang-Cheol	Biotechnology letters. 26(19) 1501-4	Angiogenin	MVMVLSPLFLVFILGLGLTPVAPAQDDYRYIHFLTQHYDAKPKGRNDEYCFNMMKNRRLTRPCKDRNTFIHGNKNDIKAICEDRNGQPYRGDLRISKSEFQITICKHKGGSSRPPCRYGATEDSRVIVVGCENGLPVHFDESFITPRH		Q2NKV1			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8522515	Purification and regulatory properties of MarA protein, a transcriptional activator of Escherichia coli multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance promoters.	Expression of the marA or soxS genes is induced by exposure of Escherichia coli to salicylate or superoxides, respectively. This, in turn, enhances the expression of a common set of promoters (the mar/soxRS regulons), resulting in both multiple antibiotic and superoxide resistance. Since MarA protein is highly homologous to SoxS, and since a MalE-SoxS fusion protein has recently been shown to activate soxRS regulon transcription, the ability of MarA to activate transcription of these genes was tested. MarA was overexpressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein, purified, cleaved with thrombin (leaving one N-terminal histidine residue), and renatured. Like MalE-SoxS, MarA (i) activated the transcription of zwf, fpr, fumC, micF, nfo, and sodA; (ii) required a 21-bp &quot;soxbox&quot; sequence to activate zwf transcription; and (iii) was &quot;ambidextrous,&quot; i.e., required the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase for activation of zwf but not fumC or micF. Thus, the mar and soxRS systems use activators with very similar specificities and mechanisms of action to respond to different environmental signals.	1995 Dec	Jair K W,Martin R G,Rosner J L,Fujita N,Ishihama A,Wolf R E	Journal of bacteriology. 177(24) 7100-4	Multiple antibiotic resistance protein marA	MSRRNTDAITIHSILDWIEDNLESPLSLEKVSERSGYSKWHLQRMFKKETGHSLGQYIRSRKMTEIAQKLKESNEPILYLAERYGFESQQTLTRTFKNYFDVPPHKYRMTNMQGESRFLHPLNHYNS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P0ACH5			8.5	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
10600457	Expression of a recombinant Toxoplasma gondii ROP2 fragment as a fusion protein in bacteria circumvents insolubility and proteolytic degradation.	A 268-amino-acid-residue carboxy-terminal antigenic fragment of the Toxoplasma gondii rhoptry protein ROP2 (recROP2(t), residues 196-464) was expressed in Escherichia coli. This recombinant fragment was produced at low concentration and in a highly insoluble form. By contrast, the level of recROP2(t) production was drastically greater when the same coding sequence was fused to the C-terminus of thioredoxin (TRX) or to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) gene. While both fusion proteins were found to be mainly insoluble, solubilization could be achieved without significant degradation. MBP was more efficient than TRX in increasing the recovery of soluble protein with more than 100f total MBP-recROP2(t) being readily expressed in a soluble form. Moreover, the insoluble form of MBP-recROP2(t) could be correctly refolded with a recovery of more than 80%. Both forms of MBP-recROP2(t) were purified to homogeneity by amylose chromatography. In contrast, the refolding of TRX-recROP2(t) promoted aggregation of the protein, which was prevented by the use of zwitterionic detergent during the one-step purification by gel filtration. Subsequent proteolytic cleavages of purified TRX-recROP2(t) and of MBP-recROP2(t) led respectively to the complete degradation or to the truncation of the recROP2(t) moiety. However, recROP2(t), despite the presence of the fusion partners, adopted a suitable conformation recognized by human serum-derived antibodies from T. gondii-seropositive individuals. Finally, both fusion proteins were able to induce specific humoral and cell-mediated immune response to the ROP2 fragment. Such fusions could represent an alternative to study the immunogenicity of T. gondii proteins which are difficult to produce because of insolubility and degradation.	1999 Dec	Jacquet A,Daminet V,Haumont M,Garcia L,Chaudoir S,Bollen A,Biemans R	Protein expression and purification. 17(3) 392-400	Rhoptry protein	LRLLRGIKNQKQAKVHLRFIFPFDLVKDPKKRKMIRVRLDERDMWVLSRFFLYPRMQSNLQMLGDVLLSHSSTHKSLVHHARLQLTLQLIRLLASLHHYGLVHADFQVSNILLDQRGGVFLTGFEHLVRDGASAVSPIGRGFAPPETTAERMLPFGQHHPTLMTFAFDTWTLGLAIYWIWCADLPNTDDAALGGSEWIFRSCKNIPQPVRALLEGFLRYPKEDRLLPLQAMETPEYEQLRTELSAVLPLYQTDGEPA	C-terminal maltose-binding protein	Q06AK3			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16368975	Production and characterization of guinea pig recombinant gamma interferon and its effect on macrophage activation.	Gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) plays a critical role in the protective immune responses against mycobacteria. We previously cloned a cDNA coding for guinea pig IFN-gamma (gpIFN-gamma) and reported that BCG vaccination induced a significant increase in the IFN-gamma mRNA expression in guinea pig cells in response to living mycobacteria and that the virulent H37Rv strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis stimulated less IFN-gamma mRNA than did the attenuated H37Ra strain. In this study, we successfully expressed and characterized recombinant gpIFN-gamma with a histidine tag at the N terminus (His-tagged rgpIFN-gamma) in Escherichia coli. rgpIFN-gamma was identified as an 18-kDa band in the insoluble fraction; therefore, the protein was purified under denaturing conditions and renatured. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the recombinant protein yielded the sequence corresponding to the N terminus of His-tagged gpIFN-gamma. The recombinant protein upregulated major histocompatibility complex class II expression in peritoneal macrophages. The antiviral activity of rgpIFN-gamma was demonstrated with a guinea pig fibroblast cell line (104C1) infected with encephalomyocarditis virus. Interestingly, peritoneal macrophages treated with rgpIFN-gamma did not produce any nitric oxide but did produce hydrogen peroxide and suppressed the intracellular growth of mycobacteria. Furthermore, rgpIFN-gamma induced morphological alterations in cultured macrophages. Thus, biologically active rgpIFN-gamma has been successfully produced and characterized in our laboratory. The study of rgpIFN-gamma will further increase our understanding of the cellular and molecular responses induced by BCG vaccination in the guinea pig model of pulmonary tuberculosis.	2006 Jan	Jeevan A,McFarland C T,Yoshimura T,Skwor T,Cho H,Lasco T,McMurray D N	Infection and immunity. 74(1) 213-24	Interferon gamma	MKYTSSILALQFCIILSFSSYYCQSRFTNEIRILKNYFNADNSDVGDNGTLFVGILKNCQEESERKIFQSQIVSFYFKLFEKHFTDNQTVQNSMNTIKEQIITKFFKDNSSNKVQAFKNLIQISVNDEHVQRQAIIELKKVIDDLSPNQRKRRRTQMLFQSRRASK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8CGS0			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16330538	Human C4b-binding protein, structural basis for interaction with streptococcal M protein, a major bacterial virulence factor.	Human C4b-binding protein (C4BP) protects host tissue, and those pathogens able to hijack this plasma glycoprotein, from complement-mediated destruction. We now show that the first two complement control protein (CCP) modules of the C4BP alpha-chain, plus the four residues connecting them, are necessary and sufficient for binding a bacterial virulence factor, the Streptococcus pyogenes M4 (Arp4) protein. Structure determination by NMR reveals two tightly coupled CCP modules in an elongated arrangement within this region of C4BP. Chemical shift perturbation studies demonstrate that the N-terminal, hypervariable region of M4 binds to a site including strand 1 of CCP module 2. This interaction is accompanied by an intermodular reorientation within C4BP. We thus provide a detailed picture of an interaction whereby a pathogen evades complement.	2006 Feb	Jenkins Huw T,Mark Linda,Ball Graeme,Persson Jenny,Lindahl Gunnar,Uhrin Dusan,Blom Anna M,Barlow Paul N	The Journal of biological chemistry. 281(6) 3690-7	C4b-binding protein alpha chain also known as Proline-rich protein	CGPPPTLSFAAPMDITLTETRFKTGTTLKYTCLPGYVRSHSTQTLTCNSDGEWVYNTFCIYKRCRHPGELRNGQVEIKTDLSFGSQIEFSCSEGFFLIGSTTSRCEVQDRGVGWSHPLPQCEIV	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P04003			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
15642470	Optimization of expression and purification of two biologically active chimeric fusion proteins that consist of human interleukin-13 and Pseudomonas exotoxin in Escherichia coli.	We have previously reported that a variety of solid human tumor cell lines express a large number of receptors for interleukin-13 (IL-13). These receptors could be targeted with a chimeric fusion protein consisting of human IL-13 and a truncated form of Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE). We describe here optimization of critical steps involved in high yield expression of two recombinant chimeric fusion proteins for obtaining highly purified and biologically active cytotoxins in Escherichia coli. The chimeric constructs of human IL-13 and two 38 kDa truncated PEs: (i) PE38 and (ii) PE38QQR, (three lysine residues in PE38 at 590, 606, and 613 substituted with two glutamine and one arginine) were used for protein expression in pET prokaryotic expression vector system with kanamycin as a selection antibiotic. Our results suggest that fresh transformation of E. coli and induction by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 6 h resulted in maximum protein expression. To further improve the yield, we used a genetically modified E. coli strain, BL21(DE3)pLysS, which carries a plasmid for lysozyme with a weak promoter that inhibits T7 RNA polymerase and minimizes protein production in the absence of IPTG. Use of this strain eliminated the need for lysozyme digestion of the induced bacteria to release inclusion bodies, which resulted in expression of purer protein as compared to the conventional BL21(DE3) strain. Additional protocol optimizations included 16 h solubilization of inclusion bodies, constitution of refolding buffer, and timing of dialysis. These proteins were finally purified by Q-Sepharose, mono-Q, and gel filtration chromatography. Between 14-22 and 21-28 mg highly purified and biologically active protein was obtained from 1L of BL21 (DE3) and BL21 (DE3) pLysS bacteria culture, respectively. As IL-13R targeting for brain tumor therapy offers an exciting treatment option, optimization of production of IL-13PE will enhance production of clinical grade material for Phase III clinical trials.	2005 Feb	Joshi Bharat H,Puri Raj K	Protein expression and purification. 39(2) 189-98	Fusion protein consisting of interleukin 13 and pseudomonas exotoxin	GPVPPSTALRELIEELVNITQNQKAPLCNGSMVWSINLTAGMYCAALESLINVSGCSAIEKTQRMLSGFCPHKVSAGQFSSLHVRDTKIEVAQFVKDLLLHLKKLFREGRFNAEEAFDLWNECAKACVLDLKDGVRSSRMSVDPAIADTNGQGVLHYSMVLEGGNDALKLAIDNALSITSDGLTIRLEGGVEPNKPVRYSYTRQARGSWSLNWLVPIGHEKPSNIKVFIHELNAGNQLSHMSPIYTIEMGDELLAKLARDATFFVRAHESNEMQPTLAISHAGVSVVMAQAQPRREKRWSEWASGKVLCLLDPLDGVYNYLAQQRCNLDDTWEGKIYRVLAGNPAKHDLDIKPTVISHRLHFPEGGSLAALTAHQACHLPLETFTRHRQPRGWEQLEQCGYPVQRLVALYLAARLSWNQVDQVIRNALASPGSGGDLGEAIREQPEQARLALTLAAAESERFVRQGTGNDEAGAASADVVSLTCPVAAGECAGPADSGDALLERNYPTGAEFLGDGGDISFSTRGTQNWTVERLLQAHRQLEERGYVFVGYHGTFLEAAQSIVFGGVRARSQDLDAIWRGFYIAGDPALAYGYAQDQEPDARGRIRNGALLRVYVPRSSLPGFYRTGLTLAAPEAAGEVERLIGHPLPLRLDAITGPEEEGGRLETILGWPLAERTVVIPSAIPTDPRNVGGDLDPSSIPDKEQAISALPDYASQPGKPPREDLK					8	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15303285	Cloning, overexpression, and characterization of cobrotoxin.	Cobrotoxin (CBTX) is a highly toxic short neurotoxin, isolated from the Taiwan cobra (Naja naja atra) venom. In the present study for the first time we report the cloning and expression of CBTX in high yields (12mg/L) in Escherichia coli. CBTX fused to the IgG-binding domain of protein A (IgG-CBTX) was expressed in the soluble form. The misfolded CBTX portion (of the overexpressed fusion protein) was refolded under optimal redox conditions. The fusion protein (IgG-CBTX) was observed to undergo auto-catalytic cleavage to yield CBTX with additional 5 amino acids upstream of its N-terminal end. The far UV and near UV circular dichroism spectra of the recombinant CBTX were identical to those of the toxin isolated from the crude venom source. Recombinant CBTX was isotope labeled (15N and 13C) and all the resonances (&#39;H, 13C, and 15N) in the protein have been unambiguously assigned. &#39; H &#39;5N HSQC spectrum of recombinant CBTX revealed that the protein is in a biologically active conformation. 1H-15Nchemical shift perturbation data showed that recombinant CBTX binds to a peptide derived from the alpha7 subunit of the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AchR) with high affinity. The AchR peptide is found to bind to residues located at the tip of Loop-2 in CBTX. The results of the present study provide an avenue to understand the structural basis for the high toxicity exhibited by CBTX. In addition, complete resonance assignments in CBTX (reported in this study) are expected to trigger intensive research towards the design of new pharmacological agents against certain neural disorders.	2004 Aug	Hsieh Hui-Chu,Kumar Thallampuranam Krishnaswamy S,Yu Chin	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 320(4) 1374-81	Cobrotoxin	LECHNQQSSQTPTTTGCSGGETNCYKKRWRDHRGYRTERGCGCPSVKNGIEINCCTTDRCNN	N-terminal IgG tag	P60770			8	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f
10962094	The preparation and catalytic properties of recombinant human prostate-specific antigen (rPSA).	The serine proteinase prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and its complex with the serine proteinase inhibitor alpha(1)-antichymotrypsin (ACT), have been used as markers for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. PSA prepared from seminal fluid is typically contaminated with the trypsin-like glandular kallikrein (hK2). Here we describe a convenient and reproducible preparation of catalytically active recombinant PSA (rPSA) and demonstrate an overall similarity in the properties of cloned and refolded rPSA to PSA purified from seminal fluid. We also present results that are relevant for increasing the sensitivity of assays of PSA activity in biological fluids, for the putative role of PSA activity in physiologically important processes, including prostate cancer metastasis, and for the design of PSA inhibitors. Specifically, we find that added salts, in particular NaCl, give rise to dramatic increases in rPSA catalytic activity, as does added glycerol. On the other hand, Zn(2+), spermine, and spermidine, each a major component of seminal and prostatic fluid, strongly inhibit rPSA activity, with Zn(2+) being a non-competitive inhibitor while spermine is a competitive inhibitor. Citrate, also a major component of seminal and prostatic fluid, spermine, and spermidine each protect rPSA from Zn(2+) inhibition, presumably via Zn(2+) sequestration. Finally, rPSA efficiently proteolyzes several protein substrates.	2000 Aug	Hsieh M C,Cooperman B S	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1481(1) 75-87	Prostate-specific antigen	IVGGWECEKHSQPWQVLVASRGRAVCGGVLVHPQWVLTAAHCIRNKSVILLGRHSLFHPEDTGQVFQVSHSFPHPLYDMSLLKNRFLRPGDDSSHDLMLLRLSEPAELTDAVKVMDLPTQEPALGTTCYASGWGSIEPEEFLTPKKLQCVDLHVISNDVCAQVHPQKVTKFMLCAGRWTGGKSTCSGDSGGPLVCNGVLQGITSWGSEPCALPERPSLYTKVVHYRKWIKDTIVANP		P07288			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9274049	Optimization of the solubilization and renaturation of fish growth hormone produced by Escherichia coli.	Growth hormone (GH) enhances the growth rate of aquacultured fish and shellfish, but it is difficult to extract native GH from fish pituitary glands. However, fish recombinant GH (rGH) can be efficiently synthesized by Escherichia coli cells, although it exists in denatured form in inclusion bodies (IB). We studied the solubilization of IB and the renaturation of rGH to help facilitate the production of a large amount of biologically active rGH. A 100-ml sample of rGH-producing E. coli produced 73.43 +/- 5.47 mg IB (dry weight, n = 3) after 20 h induction by 1 mM isopropyl beta-o-thiogalactopyranoside. Interestingly, if the bacteria were induced by 0.1 mM beta-lactose, 95.3 +/- 3.43 mg of IB was obtained. The optimal conditions for denaturation and renaturation of rGH were when IB were solubilized in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and then dialysed against pH 10 dialysis buffer (50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 2 mM EDTA) containing 100 mM L-arginine, 2 mM oxidized glutathione and 2 mM reduced glutathione for 24 h at 4 degrees C in a volume ratio of 3 to 500. At least 200f the denaturated rGH in IB was renatured. Juvenile black sea bream injected with 0.05 microgram/g resultant rGH once every 2 weeks exhibited significant increases (P &lt; 0.05) in weight gain (84%) relative to fish in the control group over a 16-week period. This process is an economical and effective way to obtain an active form of rGH biosynthesized by a prokaryotic system.	1997 Jul	Hsih M H,Kuo J C,Tsai H J	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 48(1) 66-72	Somatotropin also known as Growth hormone	QPITDSQRLFSIAVSRIQHLHLLAQRLFSDFESSLQTEEQRQLNKIFLQDFCNSDYIISPIDKHETQRSSVLKLLSISYRLVQSWEFPSRSLSGGSALRNQISPKLSELKTGIHLLIRANQDGAEMFADSSALQLAPYGNYYQSLGADESLRRSYELLACFKKDMHKVETYLTVAKCRLSPEANCTL		P34747			8	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18482572	Refolding of endostatin from inclusion bodies using high hydrostatic pressure.	High hydrostatic pressure was used for concomitant solubilization and refolding of insoluble endostatin (ES) aggregated as inclusion bodies (IBs). High hydrostatic pressure (200 MPa or 2 kbar) was applied in combination with nondenaturing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride. High levels of correctly folded ES (90 mg/L culture) were obtained after optimization/standardization of the procedure by applying pressures of 200 MPa for 16 h in 1.5 M guanidine hydrochloride/0.5 mM oxidized glutathione and reduced glutathione. Refolded ES was purified by affinity chromatography on a heparin column and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, size exclusion HPLC, circular dichroism, and intrinsic fluorescence. We demonstrated that high pressure can successfully convert insoluble IBs of ES expressed in Escherichia coli into an ES preparation with native tertiary structure and full biological activity.	2008 Aug	Chura-Chambi Rosa Maria,Genova Luis Antonio,Affonso Regina,Morganti Ligia	Analytical biochemistry. 379(1) 32-9	 Endostatin	HTHQDFQPVLHLVALNTPLSGGMRGIRGADFQCFQQARAVGLSGTFRAFLSSRLQDLYSIVRRADRGSVPIVNLKDEVLSPSWDSLFSGSQGQLQPGARIFSFDGRDVLRHPAWPQKSVWHGSDPSGRRLMESYCETWRTETTGATGQASSLLSGRLLEQKAASCHNSYIVLCIENSFMTSFSK		P39061			7.5	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

11054461	Apo(a)-kringle IV-type 6: expression in Escherichia coli, purification and in vitro refolding.	Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] belongs to the class of highly thrombo-atherogenic lipoproteins. The assembly of Lp(a) from LDL and the specific apo(a) glycoprotein takes place extracellularly in a two-step process. First, an unstable complex is formed between LDL and apo(a) due to the interaction of the unique kringle (K) IV-type 6 (T6) in apo(a) with amino groups on LDL, and in the second step this complex is stabilized by a disulfide bond between apo(a) KIV-T9 and apoB(100). In order to understand this process better, we overexpressed and purified apo(a) KIV-T6 in Escherichia coli. Recombinant KIV-T6 was expressed as a His-tag fusion protein under control of the T7 promoter in BL21 (DE3) strain. After one-step purification by affinity chromatography the yield was 7 mg/l of bacterial suspension. Expressed fusion apo(a) KIV-T6 was insoluble in physiological buffers and it also lacked the characteristic kringle structure. After refolding using a specific procedure, high-resolution (1)H-NMR spectroscopy revealed kringle structure-specific signals. Refolded KIV-T6 bound to Lys-Sepharose with a significantly lower affinity than recombinant apo(a) (EC(50) with epsilon-ACA 0.47 mM versus 2-11 mM). In competition experiments a 1000-fold molar excess of KIV-T6 was needed to reach 60 0nhibition of Lp(a) assembly.	2000 Sep	Hrzenjak A,Frank S,Maderegger B,Sterk H,Kostner G M	Protein engineering. 13(9) 661-6	Apolipoprotein(a)(lipoprotein kringle)	APTEQSPGVQDCYHGDGQSYRGSFSTTVTGRTCQSWSSMTPHWHQRTTEYYPNGGLTRNYCRNPDAEISPWCYTMDPNVRWEYCNLTQCPVTESSVLATSTAVSEQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P08519		Kringle 4 type 6	8	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f
15048833	Characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana stellacyanin: a comparison with umecyanin.	The cupredoxin domain of a putative type 1 blue copper protein (BCB) from Arabidopsis thaliana was overexpressed and purified. A recursive polymerase chain reaction method was used to synthesize an artificial coding region for the cupredoxin domain of horseradish stellacyanin (commonly known as umecyanin), prior to overexpression and purification. The recombinant proteins were refolded from inclusion bodies and reconstituted with copper, and their in vitro characteristics were studied. Recombinant umecyanin, which is nonglycosylated, has identical spectroscopic and redox properties to the native protein. The UV/Vis and EPR spectra of recombinant BCB and umecyanin demonstrate that they have comparable axial type 1 copper binding sites. Paramagnetic (1)H NMR spectroscopy highlights the similarity between the active site architectures of BCB and umecyanin. The reduction potential of recombinant BCB is 252 mV, compared to 293 mV for recombinant umecyanin. Identical pK(a) values of 9.7 are obtained for the alkaline transitions in both proteins. This study demonstrates that BCB is the A. thaliana stellacyanin and the results form the biochemical basis for a discussion of BCB function in the model vascular plant.	2004 May	Harrison Mark D,Dennison Christopher	Proteins. 55(2) 426-35	Blue copper-binding protein	YTTWATGKTFRVGDELEFDFAAGRHDVAVVSEAAFENCEKEKPISHMTVPPVKIMLNTTGPQYFICTVGDHCRFGQKLSITVVAAGATG		Q07488		cuprodoxin domain (Glu25 to Gly130)	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
8700899	Azotobacter vinelandii NIFL is a flavoprotein that modulates transcriptional activation of nitrogen-fixation genes via a redox-sensitive switch.	The NIFL regulatory protein controls transcriptional activation of nitrogen fixation (nif) genes in Azotobacter vinelandii by direct interaction with the enhancer binding protein NIFA. Modulation of NIFA activity by NIFL, in vivo occurs in response to external oxygen concentration or the level of fixed nitrogen. Spectral features of purified NIFL and chromatographic analysis indicate that it is a flavoprotein with FAD as the prosthetic group, which undergoes reduction in the presence of sodium dithionite. Under anaerobic conditions, the oxidized form of NIFL inhibits transcriptional activation by NIFA in vitro, and this inhibition is reversed when NIFL is in the reduced form. Hence NIFL is a redox-sensitive regulatory protein and may represent a type of flavoprotein in which electron transfer is not coupled to an obvious catalytic activity. In addition to its ability to act as a redox sensor, the activity of NIFL is also responsive to adenosine nucleotides, particularly ADP. This response overrides the influence of redox status on NIFL and is also observed with refolded NIFL apoprotein, which lacks the flavin moiety. These observations suggest that both energy and redox status are important determinants of nif gene regulation in vivo.	1996 Mar	Hill S,Austin S,Eydmann T,Jones T,Dixon R	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 93(5) 2143-8	Nitrogen fixation regulatory protein	MTPANPTLSNEPQAPHAESDELLPEIFRQTVEHAPIAISITDLKANILYANRAFRTITGYGSEEVLGKNESILSNGTTPRLVYQALWGRLAQKKPWSGVLVNRRKDKTLYLAELTVAPVLNEAGETIYYLGMHRDTSELHELEQRVNNQRLMIEAVVNAAPAAMVVLDRQHRVMLSNPSFCRLARDLVEDGSSESLVALLRENLAAPFETLENQGSAFSGKEISFDLGGRSPRWLSCHGRAIHIENEQAHVFFAPTEERYLLLTINDISELRQKQQDSRLNALKALMAEEELLEGMRETFNAAIHRLQGPVNLISAAMRMLERRLGDKAGNDPVLSAMREASTAGMEALENLSGSIPVRMAESKMPVNLNQLIREVITLCTDQLLAQGIVVDWQPALRLPWVMGGESSQRSMIKHLVDNAIESMSQNQVSRRELFISTRVENHLVRMEITDSGPGIPPDLVLKVFEPFFSTKPPHRVGRGMGLPVVQEIVAKHAGMVHVDTDYREGCRIVVELPFSAST	C-terminal hexahistidine + tryptophan				8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

11297757	Domain specific monoclonal anti-factor VIII antibodies generated by inclusion body-renatured factor VIII peptides.	Production of monoclonal anti-factor VIII (FVIII) antibodies was hampered by the availability of FVIII proteins devoid of albumin and the von Willebrand factor (vWF). We showed a successful way to generate domain specific anti-FVIII antibodies by using a series of Escherichia coli expressed FVIII fusion peptides. A total of eight fusion peptides were synthesized to cover almost the entire coding region of FVIII. All except one of the fusion peptides were insoluble and became aggregated as inclusion bodies. Purification and refolding of the peptides were accomplished by solublizing them with denaturants and dialyzing them in appropriate buffers, this being followed by chromatography of the refolded fractions on a metal-ion chelating column. These purified FVIII fusion peptides were used individually or as a pool to immunize mice and generate antibodies. Three monoclonal antibodies, D2, E6 and B12, were obtained. D2 recognizes a region (residues 1680-1703) of the light chain of FVIII, E6 recognizes a fragment (residues 744-1021) in the heavy chain, and B12, the A1 domain (residues 89-326). Both D2 and B12 inhibited &gt;80 0.000000VIII function. The affinities (k(A)) of the antibodies for FVIII were 1.62x10(7) M(-1) for D2 and 2.2x10(8) M(-1) for E6. Although B12 is inhibitory, it did not show a strong binding affinity with FVIII. The specificity of D2 and E6 for FVIII was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the FVIII protein in full-length recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) supplemented FVIII-deficient plasma, but not in FVIII-deficient plasma alone. An enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) using D2 or E6 was designed to detect plasma FVIII. The system may be useful in monitoring FVIII in cultured supernatants and in mouse models for gene therapy experiments.	2001 Mar	Huang C C,Li L T,Shen M C,Chen J Y,Lin S W	Thrombosis research. 101(5) 405-15	Coagulation factor VIII	ATRRYYLGAVELSWDYMQSDLGELPVDARFPPRVPKSFPFNTSVVYKKTLFVEFTDHLFNIAKPRPPWMGLLGPTIQAEVYDTVVITLKNMASHPVSLHAVGVSYWKASEGAEYDDQTSQREKEDDKVFPGGSHTYVWQVLKENGPMASDPLCLTYSYLSHVDLVKDLNSGLIGALLVCREGSLAKEKTQTLHKFILLFAVFDEGKSWHSETKNSLMQDRDAASARAWPKMHTVNGYVNRSLPGLIGCHRKSVYWHVIGMGTTPEVHSIFLEGHTFLVRNHRQASLEISPITFLTAQTLLMDLGQFLLFCHISSHQHDGMEAYVKVDSCPEEPQLRMKNNEEAEDYDDDLTDSEMDVVRFDDDNSPSFIQIRSVAKKHPKTWVHYIAAEEEDWDYAPLVLAPDDRSYKSQYLNNGPQRIGRKYKKVRFMAYTDETFKTREAIQHESGILGPLLYGEVGDTLLIIFKNQASRPYNIYPHGITDVRPLYSRRLPKGVKHLKDFPILPGEIFKYKWTVTVEDGPTKSDPRCLTRYYSSFVNMERDLASGLIGPLLICYKESVDQRGNQIMSDKRNVILFSVFDENRSWYLTENIQRFLPNPAGVQLEDPEFQASNIMHSINGYVFDSLQLSVCLHEVAYWYILSIGAQTDFLSVFFSGYTFKHKMVYEDTLTLFPFSGETVFMSMENPGLWILGCHNSDFRNRGMTALLKVSSCDKNTGDYYEDSYEDISAYLLSKNNAIEPRSFSQNSRHPSTRQKQFNATTIPENDIEKTDPWFAHRTPMPKIQNVSSSDLLMLLRQSPTPHGLSLSDLQEAKYETFSDDPSPGAIDSNNSLSEMTHFRPQLHHSGDMVFTPESGLQLRLNEKLGTTAATELKKLDFKVSSTSNNLISTIPSDNLAAGTDNTSSLGPPSMPVHYDSQLDTTLFGKKSSPLTESGGPLSLSEENNDSKLLESGLMNSQESSWGKNVSSTESGRLFKGKRAHGPALLTKDNALFKVSISLLKTNKTSNNSATNRKTHIDGPSLLIENSPSVWQNILESDTEFKKVTPLIHDRMLMDKNATALRLNHMSNKTTSSKNMEMVQQKKEGPIPPDAQNPDMSFFKMLFLPESARWIQRTHGKNSLNSGQGPSPKQLVSLGPEKSVEGQNFLSEKNKVVVGKGEFTKDVGLKEMVFPSSRNLFLTNLDNLHENNTHNQEKKIQEEIEKKETLIQENVVLPQIHTVTGTKNFMKNLFLLSTRQNVEGSYDGAYAPVLQDFRSLNDSTNRTKKHTAHFSKKGEEENLEGLGNQTKQIVEKYACTTRISPNTSQQNFVTQRSKRALKQFRLPLEETELEKRIIVDDTSTQWSKNMKHLTPSTLTQIDYNEKEKGAITQSPLSDCLTRSHSIPQANRSPLPIAKVSSFPSIRPIYLTRVLFQDNSSHLPAASYRKKDSGVQESSHFLQGAKKNNLSLAILTLEMTGDQREVGSLGTSATNSVTYKKVENTVLPKPDLPKTSGKVELLPKVHIYQKDLFPTETSNGSPGHLDLVEGSLLQGTEGAIKWNEANRPGKVPFLRVATESSAKTPSKLLDPLAWDNHYGTQIPKEEWKSQEKSPEKTAFKKKDTILSLNACESNHAIAAINEGQNKPEIEVTWAKQGRTERLCSQNPPVLKRHQREITRTTLQSDQEEIDYDDTISVEMKKEDFDIYDEDENQSPRSFQKKTRHYFIAAVERLWDYGMSSSPHVLRNRAQSGSVPQFKKVVFQEFTDGSFTQPLYRGELNEHLGLLGPYIRAEVEDNIMVTFRNQASRPYSFYSSLISYEEDQRQGAEPRKNFVKPNETKTYFWKVQHHMAPTKDEFDCKAWAYFSDVDLEKDVHSGLIGPLLVCHTNTLNPAHGRQVTVQEFALFFTIFDETKSWYFTENMERNCRAPCNIQMEDPTFKENYRFHAINGYIMDTLPGLVMAQDQRIRWYLLSMGSNENIHSIHFSGHVFTVRKKEEYKMALYNLYPGVFETVEMLPSKAGIWRVECLIGEHLHAGMSTLFLVYSNKCQTPLGMASGHIRDFQITASGQYGQWAPKLARLHYSGSINAWSTKEPFSWIKVDLLAPMIIHGIKTQGARQKFSSLYISQFIIMYSLDGKKWQTYRGNSTGTLMVFFGNVDSSGIKHNIFNPPIIARYIRLHPTHYSIRSTLRMELMGCDLNSCSMPLGMESKAISDAQITASSYFTNMFATWSPSKARLHLQGRSNAWRPQVNNPKEWLQVDFQKTMKVTGVTTQGVKSLLTSMYVKEFLISSSQDGHQWTLFFQNGKVKVFQGNQDSFTPVVNSLDPPLLTRYLRIHPQSWVHQIALRMEVLGCEAQDLY		P00451				10	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11596093	High-level expression of recombinant dengue viral NS-1 protein and its potential use as a diagnostic antigen.	The prevalence of NS1 Ab response in patients with dengue viral infection and the potential of using recombinant NS1 protein as a diagnostic antigen for dengue viral infection were investigated. In this study, the full-length and C-terminal half of NS1 proteins (rNS1, rNS1-C) were highly expressed (10-30 mg/l) and further purified and refolded. The good antigenicity of the full-length rNS1 protein was confirmed by interaction with 19 dengue NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) in ELISA; however, the antigenicity of rNS1-C was relatively lower. The full-length rNS1 antigen also differentiated reliably between sera from dengue virus-infected patients and sera from normal controls. When rNS1 was used as an antigen to detect human anti-NS1 IgM and IgG Ab, the anti-NS1 Ab response was found in 15 of 17 patients (88%) with primary dengue infection and all 16 patients (100%) with secondary dengue infection. These results indicated that using the full-length rNS1 whose antigenicity is restored as ELISA antigen, a high anti-NS1 antibody prevalence could be detected in patients with either primary or secondary dengue infection. This finding suggested that the anti-NS1 antibody appeared not only in secondary and severe dengue virus infection and might not correlate the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever. The study also verified that our purified rNS1 protein showed similar immunological properties as native dengue viral proteins. Genetic engineering production of recombinant NS1 antigen could provide a safe and valuable resource for dengue virus serodiagnosis.	2001 Nov	Huang J L,Huang J H,Shyu R H,Teng C W,Lin Y L,Kuo M D,Yao C W,Shaio M F	Journal of medical virology. 65(3) 553-60	 Non-structural protein 1	DSGCVVSWKNKELKCGSGIFITDNVHTWTEQYKFQPESPSKLASAIQKAHEEGICGIRSVTRLENLMWKQITPELNHILSENEVKLTIMTGDIKGIMQAGKRSLRPQPTELKYSWKTWGKAKMLSTESHNQTFLIDGPETAECPNTNRAWNSLEVEDYGFGVFTTNIWLKLKEKQDVFCDSKLMSAAIKDNRAVHADMGYWIESALNDTWKIEKASFIEVKNCHWPKSHTLWSNGVLESEMIIPKNLAGPVSQHNYRPGYHTQITGPWHLGKLEMDFDFCDGTTVVVTEDCGNRGPSLRTTTASGKLITEWCCRSCTLPPLRYRGEDGCWYGMEIRPLKEKEENLVNSLVTA		P29990				0	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15968051	Functional analysis of the Burkholderia cenocepacia ZmpA metalloprotease.	Burkholderia cenocepacia ZmpA is expressed as a preproenzyme typical of thermolysin-like proteases such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa LasB and Bacillus thermoproteolyticus thermolysin. The zmpA gene was expressed using the pPRO-EXHTa His(6) tag expression system, which incorporates a six-His tag at the N-terminal end of the protein, and recombinant ZmpA was purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. Upon refolding of the recombinant His(6)-pre-pro-ZmpA (62 kDa), the fusion protein was autoproteolytically cleaved into 36-kDa (mature ZmpA) and 27-kDa peptides. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to infer the identity of the active site residues of ZmpA and to confirm that the enzyme undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage. Oligonucleotide mutagenesis was used to replace H(465) with G(465) or A(465), E(377) with A(377) or D(377), or H(380) with P(380) or A(380). Mutagenesis of H(465), E(377), or H(380) resulted in the loss of both autocatalytic activity and proteolytic activity. ZmpA with either substitution in H(380) was not detectable in B. cenocepacia cell extracts. The activity of the recombinant ZmpA was inhibited by EDTA and 1,10 phenanthroline, indicating that it is a zinc metalloprotease. ZmpA, however, was not inhibited by phosphoramidon, a classical inhibitor of the thermolysin-like proteases. The refolded mature ZmpA enzyme was proteolytically active against various substrates including hide powder azure, type IV collagen, fibronectin, neutrophil alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, alpha(2)-macroglobulin, and gamma interferon, suggesting that B. cenocepacia ZmpA may cause direct tissue damage to the host or damage to host tissues through a modulation of the host&#39;s immune system.	2005 Jul	Kooi C,Corbett C R,Sokol P A	Journal of bacteriology. 187(13) 4421-9	Extracellular zinc metalloprotease	GDQPAAVDKALQLIQQNPSAFSLAAGGTARTLKFAGPQAGAPTDGDQFQVRDVIVDPDGTEHVRFDRFHAGLPVIGGDVVVHSSKGQLKQASVTQLAPINLAGSIGKVGNRAVIRNAPDVGATRARHIAAARFNSDVRRVDDAELVVFARDVTPTLAYAVRVYGKATETHGDAVLYYVDARTGTLLDAQDLIKTAAATGTGRSLYYGNLTLTTDQTGTNAYRMLDPSRGGGSVYDGRGLSSDEVEQATDLPIFTSSTNVWGNNATTDRQTVAADIDYGLALTWDYYKTTHNRNGIFNDGRGVKSYAHVVFNTGSGTTGANAAWLSSRVMAYGDGVPGTRLPKPVVSVDVAGHEMSHGVTEATANLNYSGDAGGLNESTSDIFGTLVKFYANNPNDPGNYVIGARVVSGGLRKMYKQDLDGRSFSCYPSGGFSWSNPRHDPHFTSGVGNRFFYLLSEGPSVPPTDTGLSRTQLVCNGDTTFSGLGRDKAGKIWYRTLTVYLNANSSYPNARRASIQAANDLYGANSAESATVARAWSAVGVN	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q2VL24			8	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16256937	Investigation of CC and CXC chemokine quaternary state mutants.	The chemokine family forms two different types of homodimer despite members sharing nearly identical folds. To study the formation of quaternary structure in this family, rational mutagenesis was employed on a representative member of each subfamily (MIP-1beta and IL-8). The variants were studied by analytical ultracentrifugation and NMR, and it was determined that formation of a folded monomer from a natural chemokine dimer is reasonably facile, while conversion between dimer types is not. Monomeric variants of MIP-1beta and IL-8 were randomly mutated and a lambda phage-based selection system was employed in a novel way to screen for dimerization. A total of 6,000,000 random mutants were screened, but no dimers were formed, suggesting again that the chemokine fold is robust and amenable to sequence variation, while the chemokine dimer is much more difficult to attain. This work represents a biophysical analysis of an array of chemokine quaternary state variants.	2005 Dec	Jin Hongjun,Hayes Garret L,Darbha Nithyanada S,Meyer Erik,LiWang Patricia J	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 338(2) 987-99	C-C motif chemokine 4 Also known as MIP-1-beta	MGSDPPTACCFSYTARKLPRNFVVDYYETSSLCSQPAVVFQTKRSKQVCADPSESWVQEYVYDLELN		P13236			7.5	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18485276	Appraisal of casein&#39;s inhibitory effects on aggregation accompanying carbonic anhydrase refolding and heat-induced ovalbumin fibrillogenesis.	It is well accepted that whole casein and its purified major components, due to their chaperone-like activity, are able to suppress the thermal and chemical aggregation of several substrate proteins. In this study, we set out to determine whether whole and beta-casein are able to prevent (or attenuate) aggregation accompanying refolding of chemically denatured carbonic anhydrase or to recover lost biological activity after its denaturation. Additionally, we showed attenuated heat-induced fibrillar aggregation of egg white ovalbumin in the presence of these commonly occurring unfolded proteins, as molecular chaperones. Also, the extent, rate and order of aggregation, in the presence and absence of aggregation suppressors, were compared. Although beta-casein did not prevent aggregation as strong as whole casein, both chaperones were efficient not only in suppressing the aggregation extent of denatured carbonic anhydrase, but also in delaying elongation process of amyloid fibril formation with no effect on nucleation phase.	2008 Sep	Khodarahmi Reza,Beyrami Mehdi,Soori Hosnieh	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 477(1) 67-76	Beta-casein	RELEELNVPGEIVESLSSSEESITRINKKIEKFQSEEQQQTEDELQDKIHPFAQTQSLVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPPLTQTPVVVPPFLQPEVMGVSKVKEAMAPKHKEMPFPKYPVEPFTESQSLTLTDVENLHLPLPLLQSWMHQPHQPLPPTVMFPPQSVLSLSQSKVLPVPQKAVPYPQRDMPIQAFLLYQEPVLGPVRGPFPIIV		P02666			7.75	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18479345	Cloning and expression of Bacillus phytase gene (phy) in Escherichia coli and recovery of active enzyme from the inclusion bodies.	AIMS:To isolate, clone and express a novel phytase gene (phy) from Bacillus sp. in Escherichia coli; to recover the active enzyme from inclusion bodies; and to characterize the recombinant phytase.METHODS AND RESULTS:The molecular weight of phytase was estimated as 40 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A requirement of Ca(2+) ions was found essential both for refolding and activity of the enzyme. Bacillus phytase exhibited a specific activity of 16 U mg(-1) protein; it also revealed broad pH and temperature ranges of 5.0 to 8.0 and 25 to 70 degrees C, respectively. The K(m) value of phytase for hydrolysis of sodium phytate has been determined as 0.392 mmol l(-1). The activity of enzyme has been inhibited by EDTA. The enzyme exhibited ample thermostability upon exposure to high temperatures from 75 to 95 degrees C. After 9 h of cultivation of transformed E. coli in the bioreactor, the cell biomass reached 26.81 g wet weight (ww) per l accounting for 4289 U enzyme activity compared with 1.978 g ww per l producing 256 U activity in shake-flask cultures. In silico analysis revealed a beta-propeller structure of phytase.CONCLUSIONS:This is the first report of its kind on the purification and successful in vitro refolding of Bacillus phytase from the inclusion bodies formed in the transformed E. coli.SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:Efficient and reproducible protocols for cloning, expression, purification and in vitro refolding of Bacillus phytase enzyme from the transformed E. coli have been developed. The novel phytase, with broad pH and temperature range, renaturation ability and substrate specificity, appears promising as an ideal feed supplement. Identification of site between 179th amino acid leucine and 180th amino acid asparagine offers scope for insertion of small peptides/domains for production of chimeric genes without altering enzyme activity.	2008 Oct	Rao D E C S,Rao K V,Reddy V D	Journal of applied microbiology. 105(4) 1128-37	Phytase	MNHSKTLLLTAAAGLMLTCGAVSSQAKHKLSDPYHFTVNAAAETEPVDTAGDAADDPAIWLDPKTPQNSKLITTNKKSGLVVYSLDGKMLHSYNTGKLNNVDIRYDFPLNGKKVDIAAASNRSEGKNTIEIYAIDGKNGTLQSMTDPDHPIATAINEVYGFTLYHSQKTGKYYAMVTGKEGEFEQYELKADKNGYISGKKVRAFKMNSQTEGMAADDEYGRLYIAEEDEAIWKFSAEPDGGSNGTVIDRADGRHLTPDIEGLTIYYAADGKGYLMASSQGNSSYAIYDRQGKNKYVADFRITDGPETDGTSDTDGIDVLGFGLGPEYPFGIFVAQDGENIDHGQKANQNFKIVPWERIADQIGFRPLANEQVDPRKLTDRSGK		B1GSN6			7	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18479092	Microscale NMR screening of new detergents for membrane protein structural biology.	The rate limiting step in biophysical characterization of membrane proteins is often the availability of suitable amounts of protein material. It was therefore of interest to demonstrate that microcoil nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology can be used to screen microscale quantities of membrane proteins for proper folding in samples destined for structural studies. Micoscale NMR was then used to screen a series of newly designed zwitterionic phosphocholine detergents for their ability to reconstitute membrane proteins, using the previously well characterized beta-barrel E. coli outer membrane protein OmpX as a test case. Fold screening was thus achieved with microgram amounts of uniformly (2)H, (15)N-labeld OmpX and affordable amounts of the detergents, and prescreening with SDS-gel electrophoresis ensured efficient selection of the targets for NMR studies. A systematic approach to optimize the phosphocholine motif for membrane protein refolding led to the identification of two new detergents, 138-Fos and 179-Fos, that yield 2D [ (15)N, (1)H]-TROSY correlation NMR spectra of natively folded reconstituted OmpX.	2008 Jun	Zhang Qinghai,Horst Reto,Geralt Michael,Ma Xingquan,Hong Wen-Xu,Finn M G,Stevens Raymond C,Wüthrich Kurt	Journal of the American Chemical Society. 130(23) 7357-63	Outer membrane protein X	ATSTVTGGYAQSDAQGQMNKMGGFNLKYRYEEDNSPLGVIGSFTYTEKSRTASSGDYNKNQYYGITAGPAYRINDWASIYGVVGVGYGKFQTTEYPTYKHDTSDYGFSYGAGLQFNPMENVALDFSYEQSRIRSVDVGTWIAGVGYRF		P0A917			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f

18400514	Expression, purification, refolding and characterization of a putative lysophospholipase from Pyrococcus furiosus: retention of structure and lipase/esterase activity in the presence of water-miscible organic solvents at high temperatures.	A putative lysophospholipase (PF0480) encoded by the Pyrococcus furiosus genome has previously been cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Studies involving crude extracts established the enzyme to be an esterase; however, owing presumably to its tendency to precipitate into inclusion bodies, purification and characterization have thus far not been reported. Here, we report the overexpression and successful recovery and refolding of the enzyme from inclusion bodies. Dynamic light scattering suggests that the enzyme is a dimer, or trimer, in aqueous solution. Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy show, respectively, that it has mixed beta/alpha structure and well-buried tryptophan residues. Conformational changes are negligible over the temperature range of 30-80 degrees C, and over the concentration range of 0-50% (v/v) of water mixtures with organic solvents such as methanol, ethanol and acetonitrile. The enzyme is confirmed to be an esterase (hydrolyzing p-NP-acetate and p-NP-butyrate) and also shown to be a lipase (hydrolyzing p-NP-palmitate), with lipolytic activity being overall about 18- to 20-fold lower than esterase activity. Against p-NP-palmitate the enzyme displays optimally activity at pH 7.0 and 70 degrees C. Remarkably, over 50% activity is retained at 70 degrees C in the presence of 25% acetonitrile. The high organic solvent stability and thermal stability suggest that this enzyme may have useful biodiesel-related applications, or applications in the pharmaceutical industry, once yields are optimized.	2008 Jun	Chandrayan Sanjeev Kumar,Dhaunta Neeraj,Guptasarma Purnananda	Protein expression and purification. 59(2) 327-33	Lysophospholipase	MTQVYKAKFGTPNRGWVIIVHGLGEHSGRYSKLVSMLVNEGYAVYTFDWPGHGKSPGKRGHTSVEEAMEIIDFIIEEINDKPFLFGHSLGGLTVIRYAETRPEKIRGVIASSPALAKSPKTPSFMVALAKILGVLLPSLTLSNGIDPNLLSRNPDAVKRYIEDPLVHDRISAKLGRSIFKNMDLAHREAHKIKVPVLLLVGTGDVITPPEGARKLYGEIKVEDKEIVEFEGAYHEIFEDPEWGEEFHKKIVEWIKKH	N-terminal +C terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8U3I6			7	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f
18430585	Recombinant human epidermal growth factor inclusion body solubilization and refolding at large scale using expanded-bed adsorption chromatography from Escherichia coli.	Amongst the various endogenous growth factors, epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays an important role in normal wound healing of tissue such as skin, cornea and gastrointestinal tract. Various studies have proved that supplementing recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) results in significant augmentation of wound healing. In the present work, a high level expression system with poly-arginine sequences was used for the production of recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized and the protein was refolded by using expanded-bed adsorption chromatography. The renatured protein was digested with appropriate concentration of trypsin and subsequently the digested rhEGF is purified by passing through ion-exchange chromatography (Toyopearl-SP) to obtain a biologically active protein. This process is the shortest process with reduced number of steps of purification, eliminates the usage of preparative reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) for final purification, which is an expensive technique. The purified protein was analyzed by RP-HPLC, showing a purity &gt; 99% and size exclusion chromatography profile shows that there are minimal aggregates, with 99% renatured active protein. The purified rhEGF showed a specific activity of 5 x 10(5) IU/mg protein, in comparison with NIBSC standard (1st International Standard of rDNA-derived EGF, Code 91/530). The process has been successfully adopted at 100 L fermentation scale and the rhEGF based formulation has been commercialized with brand name REGEN D, with excellent clinical results.	2008 Jul	Sharma K,Babu P V Cherish,Sasidhar P,Srinivas V K,Mohan V Krishna,Krishna Ella	Protein expression and purification. 60(1) 7-14	Epidermal Growth Factor	NSDSECPLSHDGYCLHDGVCMYIEALDKYACNCVVGYIGERCQYRDLKWWELR	N-terminal TrpE + C-terminal six arginine	P01133			6.5	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
2404941	The regulatory VirG protein specifically binds to a cis-acting regulatory sequence involved in transcriptional activation of Agrobacterium tumefaciens virulence genes.	Virulence genes of Agrobacterium tumefaciens are induced in parallel in the presence of plant phenolic compounds such as acetosyringone and the two regulatory vir genes virA and virG. In this study we identified a cis-acting regulatory sequence in the 5&#39;-noncoding region of the virE operon that is essential for this activation. To do this, we constructed a series of deletion mutants by using exonuclease Bal 31. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that the 70 base pairs upstream of the transcriptional start site were sufficient for full virE gene induction. A conserved dodecadeoxynucleotide sequence (vir box), which was previously identified in the nontranscribed sequences of all vir genes, was located at 5&#39; end of the minimum required promoter sequence. Deletion of this vir box only completely abolished induction of the virE gene. This demonstrates that the vir box functions as an upstream regulatory sequence. To study the role of the VirG protein in the activation process, we overproduced the native-sized VirG protein in Escherichia coli by fusing the lacZ&#39; start codon ATG with the second virG codon AAA using site-directed mutagenesis. The VirG protein was purified and renatured from E. coli and was shown to bind to a specific sequence in two vir gene promoters. Footprinting analysis of the virE and virB promoters identified the 12-base-pair vir box as the VirG-binding core sequence.	1990 Feb	Jin S G,Roitsch T,Christie P J,Nester E W	Journal of bacteriology. 172(2) 531-7	VirG	MKHILVIDDDAAMRHLIKEYLTVHALRVTAVSDSQQFTRVLASETVDVVVVDLNLGREDGLEIVRSLATKSDVPIIIISGDRLDEADKVVALELGASDFIAKPFGTREFLARIRVALRERPNVMRTKDRRTFCFAGWTLSLRQRRLTSTQGGDVKLTAGEFNLLVAFLEKPRDVLSREQLLIASRVREEEVYDRSIDVLILRLRRKLEEDAANPHLIKTARGAGYFFDADVNISFGGMMAA		Q8VT91			7.4	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12600998	A developmentally regulated two-component signal transduction system in Chlamydia.	Two-component systems allow bacteria to adapt to changing environmental conditions and may induce developmental changes necessary for survival. Chlamydia trachomatis alternates between two distinct developmental forms, each optimized for survival in a separate niche. Transcriptional regulation of development is not understood. The C. trachomatis genome sequence revealed a single pair of genes (ctcB-ctcC) predicted to encode proteins with sequence conservation to bacterial two-component systems. Sequence analysis revealed that the sensor kinase, CtcB, possessed an energy-sensing PAS domain and phosphorylation site. The response regulator, CtcC, had homology to sigma(54) activators, possessing conserved receiver and ATPase domains and phosphorylation site, but lacked the C-terminal DNA-binding domain. ctcB and ctcC were expressed late in the developmental cycle, and both proteins were detected in EB lysates. Recombinant CtcB and CtcC were purified from denatured Escherichia coli inclusion bodies and refolded. CtcC was found to aggregate as dimers and tetramers in solution. In vitro phosphorylation assays showed that CtcB autophosphorylated in the presence of Mg(2+), Mn(2+), and Fe(2+) and transferred the phosphoryl group in the presence of CtcC. Collectively, these results show that CtcB and CtcC function as a two-component system and are likely responsible for transcriptional regulation by sigma(54) holoenzyme during late-stage chlamydial development.	2003 May	Koo Ingrid Chou,Stephens Richard S	The Journal of biological chemistry. 278(19) 17314-9	CtcC	MSIEHILIIDDDPHILALLSEILGARNFSVSSAPGVKQAIKQISNCPFDLIISDMNMPDGSGLDIIQYTKQHRPQTPILVITAFGTIQNAVEAMRFGAFNYLTKPFSPDALFTLIAKAEELQALQQDNLFLQSQGSSISHPLIAESPSMKQLLDKARRAANSSANIFVHGESGCGKENLSFFIHKHSPRSTKPYIKVNCAAIPDTLLESEFFGHEKGAFTGATTKKVGRFELAHQGTLLLDEITEIPIHLQAKLLRAIQEQEFEHIGGIKTLPVNIRFLATSNRDLEEAIETKVLRQDLYYRLSVISLHIPPLRDRKEDILPLAHYYLEKFCKMNNKPPKTLSLEAQRNLLDYSWPGNVRELSNVLERTVILENDPAITPSMLALL		O84474			7.6	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

15781971	Dystonia-associated forms of torsinA are deficient in ATPase activity.	Early-onset dystonia is caused by mutations in the torsinA protein, a putative member of the AAA+ class of ATPases. In this study we have evaluated the ATPase activity of bacterially expressed wild-type torsinA and its disease-associated mutant forms. Upon overexpression in Escherichia coli, recombinant torsinA proteins were accumulated as insoluble inclusion bodies and required refolding to become soluble and catalytically active. The refolded wild-type and mutant torsinA proteins were capable of hydrolyzing ATP, but their specific ATPase activities differed significantly. Deletions of the amino acid residues E302/303 and F323-Y328 resulted in a decrease of ATPase activity to approximately 35% and approximately 750f the wild-type level, respectively. ATPase activity of wild-type and mutant torsinA proteins was influenced by factors that varied with cell stress, such as temperature, pH, and ionic strength, and was inhibited by sodium vanadate. Our results provide the first direct evidence for a role of torsinA as an active ATPase and suggest that the mutations in torsinA might affect normal functions of the protein by reducing its enzymatic activity.	2005 	Konakova Marina,Pulst Stefan M	Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN. 25(1) 105-17	Torsin-1A Also known as: Dystonia 1 protein	VEPISLGLALAGVLTGYIYPRLYCLFAECCGQKRSLSREALQKDLDDNLFGQHLAKKIILNAVFGFINNPKPKKPLTLSLHGWTGTGKNFVSKIIAENIYEGGLNSDYVHLFVATLHFPHASNITLYKDQLQLWIRGNVSACARSIFIFDEMDKMHAGLIDAIKPFLDYYDLVDGVSYQKAMFIFLSNAGAERITDVALDFWRSGKQREDIKLKDIEHALSVSVFNNKNSGFWHSSLIDRNLIDYFVPFLPLEYKHLKMCIRVEMQSRGYEIDEDIVSRVAEEMTFFPKEERVFSDKGCKTVFTKLDYYYDD		O14656			9	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
9649315	Effect of N-terminal truncation and solution conditions on chemokine dimer stability: nuclear magnetic resonance structural analysis of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta mutants.	Chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are a family of immune system proteins, several of which have been shown to block human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in various cell types. While the solved structures of most chemokines reveal protein dimers, evidence has accumulated for the biological activity of individual chemokine monomers, and a debate has arisen regarding the biological role of the chemokine dimer. Concurrent with this debate, several N-terminal truncations and modifications in the CC subfamily of chemokines have been shown to have functional significance, in many cases antagonizing their respective receptors and in some cases retaining the ability to block HIV entry to the cell. As the dimer interface of CC chemokines is located at their N-terminus, a structural study of N-terminally truncated chemokines will address the effect that this type of mutation has on the dimer-monomer equilibrium. We have studied the structural consequences of N-terminal truncation in macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta (MIP-1 beta), a CC chemokine that has been shown to block HIV infection. Examination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of a series of N-terminally truncated MIP-1 beta variants reveals that these proteins possess a range of ability to dimerize. A mutant beginning at amino acid Asp6 [termed MIP(6)] has near wild-type dimer properties, while further truncation results in weakened dimer affinity. The mutant MIP(9) (beginning with amino acid Thr9) has been found to exist solely as a folded monomer. Relaxation measurements yield a rotational correlation time of 8.6 +/- 0.1 ns for wild-type MIP-1 beta and 4.5 +/- 0.1 ns for the MIP(9) mutant, consistent with a wild-type dimer and a fully monomeric MIP(9) variant. The presence of physiological salt concentration drastically changes the monomer-dimer equilibrium for both wild-type and most mutant proteins, heavily favoring the dimeric form of the protein. These results have implications for structure-function analysis of existing chemokine mutants as well as for the larger debate regarding the biological existence and activity of the chemokine dimer.	1998 Jun	Laurence J S,LiWang A C,LiWang P J	Biochemistry. 37(26) 9346-54	Macrophage inflammatory protein 1-beta	MGSDPPTACCFSYTARKLPRNFVVDYYETSSLCSQPAVVFQTKRSKQVCADPSESWVQEYVYDLELN	Thioredoxin	P13236			7.4	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
15592653	Recombinant mouse canstatin inhibits chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation.	Human canstatin, a 24 kD fragment of the alpha2 chain of type IV collagen, has been proved to be one of the most effective inhibitors of angiogenesis and tumor growth. To investigate in vivo antiangiogenesis activity and in vitro effects on endothelial cell proliferation of recombinant mouse canstatin, the cDNA of mouse canstatin was introduced into an expression vector pQE40 to construct a prokaryotic expression vector pQE-mCan. The recombinant mouse canstatin efficiently expressed in E. coli M15 after IPTG induction was monitored by SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting with an anti-hexahistidine tag antibody. The expressed mouse canstatin, mainly as inclusion bodies, accounted for approximately 350f the total bacterial proteins. The inclusion bodies were washed, lysed and purified by the nickel affinity chromatography to a purity of approximately 93%. The refolded mouse canstatin was tested on the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membranes (CAM), and a large number of newly formed blood vessels were significantly regressed. In addition, recombinant mouse canstatin potently inhibited endothelial cell proliferation with no inhibition on non-endothelial cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the recombinant mouse canstatin effectively inhibited angiogenesis of the chicken embryo in a dose-dependent manner and specially suppressed in vitro the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.	2004 Dec	Hou Wei-Hong,Wang Tian-Yun,Yuan Bao-Mei,Chai Yu-Rong,Jia Yan-Long,Tian Fang,Wang Jian-Min,Xue Le-Xun	Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica. 36(12) 845-50	Canstatin	GEPGEPGLVGYQGPPGRPGPIGQMGPMGAPGRPGPPGPPGPKGQPGNRGLGFYGQKGEKGDIGQPGPNGIPSDITLVGPTTSTIHPDLYKGEKGDEGEQGIPGVISKGEEGIMGFPGIRGFPGLDGEKGVVGQKGSRGLDGFQGPSGPRGPKGERGEQGPPGPSVYSPHPSLAKGARGDPGFQGAHGEPGSRGEPGEPGTAGPPGPSVGDEDSMRGLPGEMGPKGFSGEPGSPARYLGPPGADGRPGPQGVPGPAGPPGPDGFLFGLKGSEGRVGYPGPSGFPGTRGQKGWKGEAGDCQCGQVIGGLPGLPGPKGFPGVNGELGKKGDQGDPGLHGIPGFPGFKGAPGVAGAPGPKGIKGDSRTITTKGERGQPGIPGVHGMKGDDGVPGRDGLDGFPGLPGPPGDGIKGPPGDAGLPGVPGTKGFPGDIGPPGQGLPGPKGERGFPGDAGLPGPPGFPGPPGPPGTPGQRDCDTGVKRPIGGGQQVVVQPGCIEGPTGSPGQPGPPGPTGAKGVRGMPGFPGASGEQGLKGFPGDPGREGFPGPPGFMGPRGSKGTTGLPGPDGPPGPIGLPGPAGPPGDRGIPGEVLGAQPGTRGDAGLPGQPGLKGLPGETGAPGFRGSQGMPGMPGLKGQPGFPGPSGQPGQSGPPGQHGFPGTPGREGPLGQPGSPGLGGLPGDRGEPGDPGVPGPVGMKGLSGDRGDAGMSGERGHPGSPGFKGMAGMPGIPGQKGDRGSPGMDGFQGMLGLKGRQGFPGTKGEAGFFGVPGLKGLPGEPGVKGNRGDRGPPGPPPLILPGMKDIKGEKGDEGPMGLKGYLGLKGIQGMPGVPGVSGFPGLPGRPGFIKGVKGDIGVPGTPGLPGFPGVSGPPGITGFPGFTGSRGEKGTPGVAGVFGETGPTGDFGDIGDTVDLPGSPGLKGERGITGIPGLKGFFGEKGAAGDIGFPGITGMAGAQGSPGLKGQTGFPGLTGLQGPQGEPGRIGIPGDKGDFGWPGVPGLPGFPGIRGISGLHGLPGTKGFPGSPGVDAHGDPGFPGPTGDRGDRGEANTLPGPVGVPGQKGERGTPGERGPAGSPGLQGFPGISPPSNISGSPGDVGAPGIFGLQGYQGPPGPPGPNALPGIKGDEGSSGAAGFPGQKGWVGDPGPQGQPGVLGLPGEKGPKGEQGFMGNTGPSGAVGDRGPKGPKGDQGFPGAPGSMGSPGIPGIPQKIAVQPGTLGPQGRRGLPGALGEIGPQGPPGDPGFRGAPGKAGPQGRGGVSAVPGFRGDQGPMGHQGPVGQEGEPGRPGSPGLPGMPGRSVSIGYLLVKHSQTDQEPMCPVGMNKLWSGYSLLYFEGQEKAHNQDLGLAGSCLARFSTMPFLYCNPGDVCYYASRNDKSYWLSTTAPLPMMPVAEEEIKPYISRCSVCEAPAVAIAVHSQDTSIPHCPAGWRSLWIGYSFLMHTAAGDEGGGQSLVSPGSCLEDFRATPFIECNGGRGTCHYFANKYSFWLTTIPEQNFQSTPSADTLKAGLIRTHISRCQVCMKNL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P08122			8.5	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
18501191	Heavy metal ions are potent inhibitors of protein folding.	Environmental and occupational exposure to heavy metals such as cadmium, mercury and lead results in severe health hazards including prenatal and developmental defects. The deleterious effects of heavy metal ions have hitherto been attributed to their interactions with specific, particularly susceptible native proteins. Here, we report an as yet undescribed mode of heavy metal toxicity. Cd2+, Hg2+ and Pb2+ proved to inhibit very efficiently the spontaneous refolding of chemically denatured proteins by forming high-affinity multidentate complexes with thiol and other functional groups (IC(50) in the nanomolar range). With similar efficacy, the heavy metal ions inhibited the chaperone-assisted refolding of chemically denatured and heat-denatured proteins. Thus, the toxic effects of heavy metal ions may result as well from their interaction with the more readily accessible functional groups of proteins in nascent and other non-native form.

15802227	The Bordetella pertussis virulence factor P.69 pertactin retains its immunological properties after overproduction in Escherichia coli.	Bordetella pertussis is re-emerging in several countries with a high vaccine uptake. Analysis of clinical isolates revealed antigenic divergence between vaccine strains and circulating strains with respect to P.69 pertactin. Polymorphisms in P.69 pertactin are mainly limited to regions comprised of amino acid repeats, designated region 1 and region 2. Region 1 flanks the RGD motif involved in adherence. Although antibodies against P.69 pertactin are implicated in protective immunity, little is known about the structure and location of its epitopes. Previously we described the localization of mainly linear epitopes of both human sera and mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). To study the location of conformational epitopes and to investigate the effect of variation in P.69 pertactin on vaccine efficacy, we cloned, expressed, and purified 3 naturally occurring P.69 pertactin variants, 3 mutants in which the variable regions are missing, 3 N-terminal mutants and 1 C-terminal deletion mutant. Here, we describe the procedure to clone, express, and purify up to 0.1mg P.69 pertactin and its derivatives per 1 ml Escherichia coli culture.	2005 May	Hijnen Marcel,van Gageldonk Pieter G M,Berbers Guy A M,van Woerkom Tiest,Mooi Frits R	Protein expression and purification. 41(1) 106-12	Pertactin Cleaved into: Outer membrane protein P.69	DWNNQSIVKTGERQHGIHIQGSDPGGVRTASGTTIKVSGRQAQGILLENPAAELQFRNGSVTSSGQLSDDGIRRFLGTVTVKAGKLVADHATLANVGDTWDDDGIALYVAGEQAQASIADSTLQGAGGVQIERGANVTVQRSAIVDGGLHIGALQSLQPEDLPPSRVVLRDTNVTAVPASGAPAAVSVLGASELTLDGGHITGGRAAGVAAMQGAVVHLQRATIRRGDAPAGGAVPGGAVPGGAVPGGFGPGGFGPVLDGWYGVDVSGSSVELAQSIVEAPELGAAIRVGRGARVTVSGGSLSAPHGNVIETGGARRFAPQAAPLSITLQAGAHAQGKALLYRVLPEPVKLTLTGGADAQGDIVATELPSIPGTSIGPLDVALASQARWTGATRAVDSLSIDNATWVMTDNSNVGALRLASDGSVDFQQPAEAGRFKVLTVNTLAGSGLFRMNVFADLGLSDKLVVMQDASGQHRLWVRNSGSEPASANTLLLVQTPLGSAATFTLANKDGKVDIGTYRYRLAANGNGQWSLVGAKAPPAPKPAPQPGPQPPQPPQPQPEAPAPQPPAGRELSAAANAAVNTGGVGLASTLWYAESNALSKRLGELRLNPDAGGAWGRGFAQRQQLDNRAGRRFDQKVAGFELGADHAVAVAGGRWHLGGLAGYTRGDRGFTGDGGG		P14283			8.8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
12168663	Collagen-targeted BMP3 fusion proteins arrayed on collagen matrices or porous ceramics impregnated with Type I collagen enhance osteogenesis in a rat cranial defect model.	Bone morphogenetic protein 3 (BMP3) is a potent osteoinductive growth factor belonging to the TGF-beta superfamily. In this study, we engineered a recombinant BMP3 protein to include an auxiliary collagen-targeting domain derived from von Willebrand coagulation factor (vWF). The collagen-targeted BMP3 fusion protein (rhBMP3-C) was expressed in E. coli, purified from bacterial inclusion bodies, renatured under controlled redox conditions, and assayed for biological activity in vitro and in vivo. The renatured rhBMP3-C fusion protein bound tightly to collagen matrices and inhibited DNA synthesis in normal rat calvaria cells and in two out of three human osteosarcoma cell lines tested. Alkaline phosphatase activity was increased in rat calvarial cells and was decreased in osteosarcoma cells in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Collagen sponges impregnated with rhBMP3-C and implanted subcutaneously in Fischer-344 rats induced dose-dependent dystrophic calcification of the collagen matrix, with no evidence of ectopic bone formation. However, local injection of rhBMP3-C infused in a collagen suspension induced new bone formation on the periosteal surface of rat calvaria. Finally, in a rat cranial defect model, surgical implantation of rhBMP3-C arrayed on either collagen sponges or on porous ceramics coated with Type I collagen exhibited marked osteoinductive properties. Taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of engineering and manufacturing targeted-BMPs which exhibit an integral gain-of-function that may be exploited to therapeutic advantage in (i) the enhancement of effective local concentrations, (ii) the prevention of systemic biodistribution and side effects, and (iii) the design of improved osteoinductive matrices.	2002 Jul	Han Bo,Perelman Natalya,Tang Baowei,Hall Fredrick,Shors Edwin C,Nimni Marcel E	Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society. 20(4) 747-55	Bone morphogenetic protein 3	QWIEPRNCARRYLKVDFADIGWSEWIISPKSFDAYYCSGACQFPMPKSLKPSNHATIQSIVRAVGVVSGIPEPCCVPEKMSSLSILFFDENKNVVLKVYPNMTVDSCACR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P49002			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16317005	The Schizosaccharomyces pombe replication inhibitor Spd1 regulates ribonucleotide reductase activity and dNTPs by binding to the large Cdc22 subunit.	Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme that provides the cell with a balanced supply of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates for DNA replication and repair. Mutations that affect the regulation of RNR in yeast and mammalian cells can lead to genetic abnormalities and cell death. We have expressed and purified the components of the RNR system in fission yeast, the large subunit Cdc22p, the small subunit Suc22p, and the replication inhibitor Spd1p. It was proposed (Liu, C., Powell, K. A., Mundt, K., Wu, L., Carr, A. M., and Caspari, T. (2003) Genes Dev. 17, 1130-1140) that Spd1 is an RNR inhibitor, acting by anchoring the Suc22p inside the nucleus during G1 phase. Using in vitro assays with highly purified proteins we have demonstrated that Spd1 indeed is a very efficient inhibitor of fission yeast RNR, but acting on Cdc22p. Furthermore, biosensor technique showed that Spd1p binds to the Cdc22p with a KD of 2.4 microM, whereas the affinity to Suc22p is negligible. Therefore, Spd1p inhibits fission yeast RNR activity by interacting with the Cdc22p. Similar to the situation in budding yeast, logarithmically growing fission yeast increases the dNTP pools 2-fold after 3 h of incubation in the UV mimetic 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide. This increase is smaller than the increase observed in budding yeast but of the same order as the dNTP pool increase when synchronous Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc10 cells are going from G1 to S-phase.	2006 Jan	Håkansson Pelle,Dahl Lina,Chilkova Olga,Domkin Vladimir,Thelander Lars	The Journal of biological chemistry. 281(3) 1778-83	S-phase delaying protein 1	MHSSKRVMTTKTHVEQPESSMRPQLPESIQGSLMDVGMRVRKSISTGYKSKQTTFPAYNPPLYNTVSENIALKNTAFSYEPNGTKRPFEQAIPNYNWANPPQDFEEPEWLKPFDVVMEGTNERL		Q10585			7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9473451	Isolation and expression of murine carbonic anhydrase IV.	A 1193-bp cDNA containing the complete murine carbonic anhydrase IV coding sequence was isolated from a Balb/c kidney cDNA library. The entire coding sequence plus shorter segments was used in an Escherichia coli T7 expression vector system to produce four forms of murine CA IV, including (1) a protein representing the full-length coding sequence, (2) an amino-truncated protein lacking the 18 N-terminal amino acid plasma membrane targeting sequence, (3) a protein which lacked the plasma membrane targeting sequence and 26 C-terminal amino acids, and (4) a protein which lacked both 36 N-terminal residues (the plasma membrane targeting sequence plus 18 additional amino acids which included the first two cysteines) and 26 C-terminal residues. All four proteins were expressed as catalytically inactive inclusion bodies. After rapid dilution of washed, guanidine hydrochloride-denatured inclusion bodies into a glutathione-, l-arginine-containing renaturation buffer, an active carbonic anhydrase IV at yields of 3-4 mg/liter was easily purified from cultures expressing the form lacking the N-terminal targeting sequence and 26 C-terminal residues. The longest and shortest forms of carbonic anhydrase IV failed to refold into active enzyme under these conditions. The activity of purified recombinant carbonic anhydrase IV was highly resistant to sodium dodecyl sulfate, as is the native enzyme. This resistance presumably results from intramolecular disulfide bonds maintaining a functional active site configuration even in the presence of denaturing agents.	1998 Feb	Hurt J D,Tu C,Laipis P J	Protein expression and purification. 12(1) 7-16	Carbonic anhydrase IV	EDSGWCYEIQTKDPRSSCLGPEKWPGACKENQQSPINIVTARTKVNPRLTPFILVGYDQKQQWPIKNNQHTVEMTLGGGACIIGGDLPARYEAVQLHLHWSNGNDNGSEHSIDGRHFAMEMHIVHKKLTSSKEDSKDKFAVLAFMIEVGDKVNKGFQPLVEALPSISKPHSTSTVRESSLQDMLPPSTKMYTYFRYNGSLTTPNCDETVIWTVYKQPIKIHKNQFLEFSKNLYYDEDQKLNMKDNVRPLQPLGKRQVFKS		Q64444			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
3281831	Expression, renaturation and purification of recombinant human interleukin 4 from Escherichia coli.	The lymphokine human interleukin 4 (IL-4) has been expressed from a plasmid in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli. Advantage has been taken of insolubility of the human IL-4 in E. coli for rapid purification of this protein in only a few steps. We describe extraction and renaturation procedures which solubilize human IL-4 yielding biologically active protein. The protein was purified to homogeneity by one passage over a gel-filtration column. The refolded human IL-4 was characterized by N-terminal sequence analysis, amino acid analysis and bioassays. The refolded E. coli-derived human IL-4 has biological activity on T and B cells and binds to the human IL-4 receptor, comparable to mammalian expressed human IL-4, indicating that the protein is folded correctly.	1988 Apr	van Kimmenade A,Bond M W,Schumacher J H,Laquoi C,Kastelein R A	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 173(1) 109-14	Interleukin-4	HKCDITLQEIIKTLNSLTEQKTLCTELTVTDIFAASKNTTEKETFCRAATVLRQFYSHHEKDTRCLGATAQQFHRHKQLIRFLKRLDRNLWGLAGLNSCPVKEANQSTLENFLERLKTIMREKYSKCSS		P05112			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15695507	Biophysical comparison of BMP-2, ProBMP-2, and the free pro-peptide reveals stabilization of the pro-peptide by the mature growth factor.	Pro-forms of growth factors have received intensive scientific attention recently because in some cases different biological activities have been ascribed compared with the mature growth factors. Examples are the pro-apoptotic role of the nerve growth factor (NGF) proform (proNGF) or the latency of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta pro-form (proTGF-beta). To investigate a possible biological function of the pro-form of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, a member of the TGF-beta family, mature BMP-2, proBMP-2, and the isolated pro-peptide were recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli cells, and a biophysical comparison was performed. Protocols were developed that allowed efficient refolding and subsequent purification of the proteins. ProBMP-2 could be processed to an N-terminally truncated form of BMP-2, digit removed BMP-2 (drBMP-2), that possessed biological activity, i.e. it induced ectopic bone formation. Bone inducing activity was also displayed by proBMP-2. The three proteins were characterized both by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. From these analyses, predominant beta-sheet secondary structural elements in the pro-peptide were deduced. The thermodynamic stability of the pro-peptide was determined by chemical unfolding assays. As in the case of NGF/proNGF, the mature part of BMP-2 stabilized the structure of the pro-peptide moiety. However, in contrast to NGF/proNGF, the pro-peptide did not stimulate oxidative folding of the mature part in vitro.	2005 Apr	Hillger Frank,Herr Gerhard,Rudolph Rainer,Schwarz Elisabeth	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(15) 14974-80	Bone morphogenetic protein-2	LKSSCKRHPLYVDFSDVGWNDWIVAPPGYHAFYCHGECPFPLADHLNSTNHAIVQTLVNSVNSKIPKACCVPTELSAISMLYLDENEKVVLKNYQDMVVE	N-terminal hexahistidine tag				8	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8090768	Binding of soluble natural ligands to a soluble human T-cell receptor fragment produced in Escherichia coli.	An Escherichia coli expression system has been developed to produce milligram quantities of the variable domains of a human T-cell receptor from a cytotoxic T cell that recognizes the HLA-A2-influenza matrix peptide complex as a single polypeptide chain. The recombinant protein was purified by metal-chelate chromatography and then refolded in a redox buffer system. The refolded protein was shown to directly bind both Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin B and the major histocompatibility complex protein-peptide complex using a BIAcore biosensor. Thus this preparation of a single-chain, variable-domain, T-cell receptor fragment can bind both of its natural ligands and some of it is therefore a functional fragment of the receptor molecule.	1994 Sep	Hilyard K L,Reyburn H,Chung S,Bell J I,Strominger J L	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 91(19) 9057-61	Tcell alpha chain	MDSYEGQEVNITCSHNNIATNDYITWYQQFPSQGPRFIIQGYKTKVTNEVASLFIPADRKSSTLSLPRVSLSDTAVYYCLVVRDSSYKLIFGSGTRLLVRP	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	A2NZL4			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f
8419346	Characterization of the forward and reverse integration reactions of the Moloney murine leukemia virus integrase protein purified from Escherichia coli.	The forward and reverse reactions for integration were characterized for the Moloney murine leukemia virus integrase (M-MuLV IN) protein. The M-MuLV IN was recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli, and was purified to greater than 900mogeneity by a one-step affinity purification scheme. M-MuLV IN was highly active for integration as measured by in vitro cleavage and strand transfer assays. Furthermore, the integration of a model viral substrate into lambda concatamers by IN correctly produced the flanking 4-base pair duplications characteristic of M-MuLV IN. The reverse reaction of integration, disintegration, was also catalyzed by the recombinant M-MuLV IN. Two products were generated, a 3&#39;-recessed long terminal repeat and a ligated target DNA, from a model integration-intermediate substrate in the presence of M-MuLV IN. The requirements and optimal conditions for maximal integration and disintegration activity for M-MuLV IN were determined. The forward and reverse reactions required different concentrations of manganese ion and reductant. Salt was also titrated for the forward and reverse reactions. Sodium chloride inhibited integration, but had little affect on disintegration. Low concentrations of potassium chloride enhanced integration, but had no affect on disintegration. The dinucleotide cleavage, strand transfer, and the disintegration reactions each had a unique pH profile of activity.	1993 Jan	Jonsson C B,Donzella G A,Roth M J	The Journal of biological chemistry. 268(2) 1462-9	Integrase	KPLAAAYQDQQDQPVIPHPFRVGDTVWVRRHQTKNLEPRWKGPYTVLLTTPTALKVDGIAAWIHAAHVKAATTPPAGTASGPTWKVQRSQNPLKIRLTRGAP		Q80SU2			7.4	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

OBJECTIVE:Recombinant human pro-urokinase forms insoluble inclusion body when overexpressed in Escherichia coli. It must be denatured and renatured in vitro so that it can acquire activity. This study aimed at increasing the renaturation yield of denaturant pro-urokinase.METHODS:We evaluated the basic renaturation conditions of pro-urokinase through qualitative and quantitative analysis of pH, temperature, denatured concentration, protein concentration, and the ratio of reduced and oxidized thiol reagents. We also compared the effects of nonspecific additives, step-wise dilution and urea gradient dialysis.RESULTS:We defined the optimal conditions of pro-urokinase renaturation with a yield of about 20%                             .CONCLUSION:Different recombinant denatured proteins have different renaturation conditions due to their different molecular sizes, molecular constructions, disulfide bond numbers, and hydrophobicity. The renaturation yield can be increased by optimizing the renaturation conditions of a specific protein.	2001 Feb	Zhu H,Liu W,Shi W,Xue Y,Kuai L,Ma Z	Chinese medical journal. 114(2) 186-90	Urokinase-type plasminogen activator	SNELHQVPSNCDCLNGGTCVSNKYFSNIHWCNCPKKFGGQHCEIDKSKTCYEGNGHFYRGKASTDTMGRPCLPWNSATVLQQTYHAHRSDALQLGLGKHNYCRNPDNRRRPWCYVQVGLKPLVQECMVHDCADGKKPSSPPEELKFQCGQKTLRPRFKIIGGEFTTIENQPWFAAIYRRHRGGSVTYVCGGSLMSPCWVISATHCFIDYPKKEDYIVYLGRSRLNSNTQGEMKFEVENLILHKDYSADTLAHHNDIALLKIRSKEGRCAQPSRTIQTICLPSMYNDPQFGTSCEITGFGKENSTDYLYPEQLKMTVVKLISHRECQQPHYYGSEVTTKMLCAADPQWKTDSCQGDSGGPLVCSLQGRMTLTGIVSWGRGCALKDKPGVYTRVSHFLPWIRSHTKEENGLAL		P00749			8.6	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8484780	Comparison of the disulfide bond arrangements of human recombinant and bovine brain heparin binding neurite-promoting factors.	Heparin binding neurite-promoting factor (HBNF) is a highly basic 136 amino acid protein containing 10 cysteine residues. We have determined the redox status and the disulfide arrangement of the cysteine residues in HBNF from bovine brain and refolded human recombinant protein produced in E. coli. Our data indicate that all 10 cysteines are involved in disulfide bond formation. The disulfide linkages of human recombinant and bovine brain HBNF, as determined after proteolytic digestions of the non-reduced proteins by peptide mapping and sequence analysis are: Cys15-Cys44, Cys23-Cys53, Cys30-Cys57, Cys67-Cys99 and Cys77-Cys109. Thus, recombinant HBNF has the same disulfide arrangement as the native brain-derived protein.	1993 Apr	Hulmes J D,Seddon A P,Decker M M,Böhlen P	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 192(2) 738-46	Heparin-binding neurite-promoting factor	GKKEKPEKKVKKSDCGEWQWSVCVPTSGDCGLGTREGTRTGAECKQTMKTQRCKIPCNWKKQFGAECKYQFQAWGECDLNTALKTRTGSLKRALHNAECQKTVTISKPCGKLTKPKPQAESKKKKKEGKKQEKMLD		P21246			7.4	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16413550	Construction of a fully active truncated alternansucrase partially deleted of its carboxy-terminal domain.	Recombinant expression of the large alternansucrase (2057 amino acids) was hindered in E. coli due to poor enzyme solubility and protein degradation. The effects of deletions of the alternansucrase C-terminal CW-like and APY repeated motifs on enzyme solubility and specificity were investigated. A truncated variant deleted of the APY repeats but harboring four C-terminal CW-like repeats displayed a high specific activity and the same specificity of product synthesis as the native enzyme. It is more soluble and suffers less degradation than full length alternansucrase. Hence this truncated variant is a promising tool for the further structural and kinetic study of this interesting enzyme.	2006 Feb	Joucla Gilles,Pizzut Sandra,Monsan Pierre,Remaud-Simeon Magali	FEBS letters. 580(3) 763-8	Alternansucrase	MKQQETVTRKKLYKSGKVWVAAATAFAVLGVSTVTTVHADTNSNVAVKQINNTGTNDSGEKKVPVPSTNNDSLKQGTDGFWYDSDGNRVDQKTNQILLTAEQLKKNNEKNLSVISDDTSKKDDENISKQTKIANQQTVDTAKGLTTSNLSDPITGGHYENHNGYFVYIDASGKQVTGLQNIDGNLQYFDDNGYQVKGSFRDVNGKHIYFDSVTGKASSNVDIVNGKAQGYDAQGNQLKKSYVADSSGQTYYFDGNGQPLIGLQTIDGNLQYFNQQGVQIKGGFQDVNNKRIYFAPNTGNAVANTEIINGKLQGRDANGNQVKNAFSKDVAGNTFYFDANGVMLTGLQTISGKTYYLDEQGLRKNYAGTFNNQFMYFDADTGAGKTAIEYQFDQGLVSQSNENTPHNAAKSYDKSSFENVDGYLTADTWYRPTDILKNGDTWTASTETDMRPLLMTWWPDKQTQANYLNFMSSKGLGITTTYTAATSQKTLNDAAFVIQTAIEQQISLKKSTEWLRDAIDSFVKTQANWNKQTEDEAFDGLQWLQGGFLAYQDDSHRTPNTDSGNNRKLGRQPINIDGSKDTTDGKGSEFLLANDIDNSNPIVQAEQLNWLHYLMNFGSITGNNDNANFDGIRVDAVDNVDADLLKIAGDYFKALYGTDKSDANANKHLSILEDWNGKDPQYVNQQGNAQLTMDYTVTSQFGNSLTHGANNRSNMWYFLDTGYYLNGDLNKKIVDKNRPNSGTLVNRIANSGDTKVIPNYSFVRAHDYDAQDPIRKAMIDHGIIKNMQDTFTFDQLAQGMEFYYKDQENPSGFKKYNDYNLPSAYAMLLTNKDTVPRVYYGDMYLEGGQYMEKGTIYNPVISALLKARIKYVSGGQTMATDSSGKDLKDGETDLLTSVRFGKGIMTSDQTTTQDNSQDYKNQGIGVIVGNNPDLKLNNDKTITLHMGKAHKNQLYRALVLSNDSGIDVYDSDDKAPTLRTNDNGDLIFHKTNTFVKQDGTIINYEMKGSLNALISGYLGVWVPVGASDSQDARTVATESSSSNDGSVFHSNAALDSNVIYEGFSNFQAMPTSPEQSTNVVIATKANLFKELGITSFELAPQYRSSGDTNYGGMSFLDSFLNNGYAFTDRYDLGFNKADGNPNPTKYGTDQDLRNAIEALHKNGMQAIADWVPDQIYALPGKEVVTATRVDERGNQLKDTDFVNLLYVANTKSSGVDYQAKYGGEFLDKLREEYPSLFKQNQVSTGQPIDASTKIKQWSAKYMNGTNILHRGAYYVLKDWATNQYFNIAKTNEVFLPLQLQNKDAQTGFISDASGVKYYSISGYQAKDTFIEDGNGNWYYFDKDGYMVRSQQGENPIRTVETSVNTRNGNYYFMPNGVELRKGFGTDNSGNVYYFDDQGKMVRDKYINDDANNFYHLNVDGTMSRGLFKFDSDTLQYFASNGVQIKDSYAKDSKGNKYYFDSATGNNDTGKAQTWDGNGYYITIDSDANNTIGVNTDYTAYITSSLREDGLFANAPYGVVTKDQNGNDLKWQYINHTKQYEGQQVQVTRQYTDSKGVSWNLITFAGGDLQGQRLWVDSRALTMTPFKTMNQISFISYANRNDGLFLNAPYQVKGYQLAGMSNQYKGQQVTIAGVANVSGKDWSLISFNGTQYWIDSQALNTNFTHDMNQKVFVNTTSNLDGLFLNAPYRQPGYKLAGLAKNYNNQTVTVSQQYFDDQGTVWSQVVLGGQTVWVDNHALAQMQVSDTDQQLYVNSNGRNDGLFLNAPYRGQGSQLIGMTADYNGQHVQVTKQGQDAYGAQWRLITLNNQQVWVDSRALSTTIMQAMNDNMYVNSSQRTDGLWLNAPYTMSGAKWAGDTRSANGRYVHISKAYSNEVGNTYYLTNLNGQSTWIDKRAFTVTFDQVVALNATIVARQRPDGMFKTAPYGEAGAQFVDYVTNYNQQTVPVTKQHSDAQGNQWYLATVNGTQYWIDQRSFSPVVTKVVDYQAKIVPRTTRDGVFSGAPYGEVNAKLVNMATAYQNQVVHATGEYTNASGITWSQFALSGQEDKLWIDKRALQA		Q9RE05			5.4	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15882950	Cloning and expression of Klebsiella phage K11 lysozyme gene.	Previously, the lysozyme gene of the Klebsiella phage K11 was partially sequenced in our lab. Using the sequence information the lysozyme gene of the Klebsiella phage K11 was amplified and cloned using the polymerase chain reaction of the pfu DNA polymerase. The nucleotide sequence of phage K11 lysozyme gene was determined. The open reading frame corresponds to a polypeptide with 151 amino acids and molecular weight of 16,932 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of this polypeptide shows 74-750mologies to the T7 and T3 phage lysozymes. Although the gene was efficiently expressed under the control of tac promoter in Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells at 37 degrees C, most of the K11 lysozyme produced was insoluble. When the temperature of cell growth was lowered, however, solubility of the K11 lysozyme was increased gradually. The insoluble protein expressed at 37 degrees C was solubilized in 5 M guanidine-HCl and refolded in the presence of oxido-shuffling agent (GSH/GSSG). Through the refolding process the recombinant lysozyme was solubilized and purified. The purified K11 lysozyme showed transcription inhibition of K11 RNA polymerase as well as amidase activity. These results showed that the lysozyme of bacteriophage K11 is a bifunctional protein that cuts a bond in the bacterial cell wall and selectively inhibits K11 phage RNA polymerase. Also, transcription inhibition ability of K11 lysozyme with T7 or SP6 phage RNA polymerase was measured. T7 RNA polymerase was less inhibited than K11 RNA polymerase by K11 lysozyme. But SP6 RNA polymerase was not nearly inhibited by K11 lysozyme.	2005 Jul	Junn Hyun Jung,Youn Jooho,Suh Kyong Hoon,Lee Sang Soo	Protein expression and purification. 42(1) 78-84	Lysozyme	MAKVQFTKRQETSQFFVHCSATKANMDVGVREIRQWHKEQGWLDVGYHFIIRRDGTVEAGRDQDAVGSHVKGYNSTSVGVCLVGGIDAKGNPEANFTPQQMSALNGVLHELRGTYPKAVIMAHHDVAPKACPSFDLQRWVKTGELVTSDRG	N-terminal T7 tag	Q3ZFI3			8	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
14550642	Purification of enzymatically active human lysyl oxidase and lysyl oxidase-like protein from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies.	Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is an extracellular copper dependent enzyme catalyzing lysine-derived cross-links in extracellular matrix proteins. Recent molecular cloning has revealed the existence of a LOX family consisting of LOX and four lysyl oxidase-like proteins (LOXLs; LOXL, LOXL2, LOXL3, and LOXL4). Each member of the LOX family contains a copper-binding domain, residues for lysyl-tyrosyl quinone, and a cytokine receptor-like domain. Very recently, novel functions, such as tumor suppression, cellular senescence, and chemotaxis, have been attributed to this family of amine oxidases, but functional differences among the family members have yet to be determined. For efficient expression and purification, we cloned the cDNAs corresponding to proteolytically processed forms of LOX (LOX-p) and LOXL (LOXL-p1 and LOXL-p2) into a bacterial expression vector pET21a with six continuous histidine codons attached to the 3&#39; of the gene. The recombinant proteins were purified with nickel-chelating affinity chromatography and converted into enzymatically active forms by stepwise dialysis in the presence of N-lauroylsarcosinate and Cu2+. The purified LOX-p, LOXL-p1, and LOXL-p2 proteins showed specific amine oxidase activity of 0.097, 0.054, and 0.150 U/mg, respectively, which was inhibited by beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a specific inhibitor of LOX. Availability of these pure and active forms of LOX and LOXLs will be significantly helpful in functional studies related to substrate specificity and crystal structures of this family of amine oxidases.	2003 Oct	Jung Sang Taek,Kim Moon Suk,Seo Ji Yeon,Kim Hyung Chul,Kim Youngho	Protein expression and purification. 31(2) 240-6	Lysyl oxidase	DDPYNPYKYSDDNPYYNYYDTYERPRPGGRYRPGYGTGYFQYGLPDLVADPYYIQASTYVQKMSMYNLRCAAEENCLASTAYRADVRDYDHRVLLRFPQRVKNQGTSDFLPSRPRYSWEWHSCHQHYHSMDEFSHYDLLDANTQRRVAEGHKASFCLEDTSCDYGYHRRFACTAHTQGLSPGCYDTYGADIDCQWIDITDVKPGNYILKVSVNPSYLVPESDYTNNVVRCDIRYTGHHAYASGCTISPY	N-terminal GST and C-terminal hexahis	P28300			9.6	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11589461	Two-step chromatographic purification of recombinant Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein from Escherichia coli.	The Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (PfCS) protein (aa 19-405) has been cloned and expressed in E. coli. The protein was purified in a two-step process that was rapid and reproducible. E. coli cells were grown to a high density before induction for 1 h. Cells were disrupted by high pressure microfluidization and the total bacterial protein solubilized in 6 M Gu-HCl. The protein was refolded while bound to Ni-NTA agarose by exchange of 6 M Gu-HCl for 8 M urea and then slow removal of the urea. The eluted protein was further purified on Q Sepharose Fast Flow using conditions developed to remove E. coli proteins and reduce endotoxin (to 10 EU/50 microg). Yield was 20 mg of PfCS protein from 10 g of wet cell paste. The final protein product bound to HepG2 liver cells in culture and inhibited the invasion of those cells by sporozoites in an ISI assay greater than 800ver control cultures when used at 10 microg/ml.	2001 Oct	Kolodny N,Kitov S,Vassell M A,Miller V L,Ware L A,Fegeding K,De La Vega P,Sacci J B,Lanar D E	Journal of chromatography.

15978837	Refolding and purification of recombinant OsNifU1A domain II that was expressed by Escherichia coli.	OsNifU1A is a NifU-like rice (Oryza sativa) protein, discovered recently. Its amino acid sequence is very homologous to the sequence of cyanobacterial CnfU and to the sequences of NifU C-terminal domains. Based on its sequence, OsNifU1A is probably a modular structure consisting of two CnfU-like domains, with domain I (formed by residues Leu73 to Gly153) and domain II (formed by residues Leu154 to Ser226). Domain I have a conserved Cys-X-X-Cys motif, which may function as an iron-sulfur cluster assembly scaffold. Domain II lacks a Cys-X-X-Cys motif and therefore, cannot function analogously. Other NifU-like proteins, with sequences homologous to OsNifU1A domain II, have been identified during plant genomic projects; however, the biological roles of these domains remain unknown. We successfully constructed an Escherichia coli expression system for OsNifU1A domain II that enabled us to synthesize and purify milligram quantities of protein for use in structural and functional studies. Using the Gateway system, we built DNA sequences corresponding to two OsNifU1A domain II fusion proteins. One construct has a (His)6 sequence upstream of the OsNifU1A domain II sequence; the other has an upstream thioredoxin-(His)6 sequence. Recombinant OsNifU1A domain II fusion proteins were extracted from E. coli inclusion bodies by dissolving them in 6 M guanidine-HCl. About 360f the total (His)6/OsNifU1A domain II fusion protein initially present remained soluble after guanidine-HCl was completely removed by step-wise dialysis; whereas, recovery of soluble Trx-(His)6 fusion protein was about 600f the total cell lysate. About 2 mg of 15N-labeled OsNifU1A domain II was purified for NMR spectral studies. Examination of the OsNifU1A domain II 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum indicated that the purified protein was monomeric and correctly folded. Therefore, we established an efficient procedure for synthesis and purification of 15N-labeled OsNifU1A domain II in quantities sufficient for heteronuclear NMR solution structure studies.	2005 Oct	Katoh Shizue,Murata Katsuyoshi,Kubota Yoshiki,Kumeta Hiroyuki,Ogura Kenji,Inagaki Fuyuhiko,Asayama Munehiko,Katoh Etsuko	Protein expression and purification. 43(2) 149-56	NifU-like protein 1, chloroplast Also known as OsNifu1	RPPLVVGAIAGLDPVTAVQLPLTAGNVESVLDQVRPYLTADGGDVALHEIAGNVVRLKLQGACGSCPSSLITIKRGIERRLMEKIPDVAAVEPVTDKETGLELNEENVEKVLNEIRPYLAGTGGGGLQFLMIKGPIVKVRLTGPAAVVRTVRIAVSKKLREKIPSIQIVQLLS		Q84LK7		OsNifU1A domain II	8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
8774868	Purification and refolding of recombinant Haemophilus influenzae type b porin produced in Bacillus subtilis.	The major diffusion channel in the outer membrane of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is porin (341 amino acids; Mr 37 782). The Hib porin gene was cloned and overexpressed in Bacillus subtilis. Recombinant Hib porin (Bac porin), having aggregated into inclusion bodies, was purified under denaturing conditions and subsequently refolded. To compare Bac porin that is intrinsically devoid of lipooligosaccharides versus native Hib porin, the properties of Bac porin were assessed by the following four criteria: circular dichroism spectroscopy, channel formation in planar bilayers, resistance to trypsin digestion and formation of the conformational epitope recognized by an anti-Hib porin monoclonal antibody. We conclude that in the absence of lipooligosaccharides, Bac porin was refolded into a functional form which closely resembled the structure of Hib porin.	1996 Sep	Dahan D,Srikumar R,Laprade R,Coulton J W	FEBS letters. 392(3) 304-8	Outer membrane protein P2 Also known as Bac porin	AVVYNNEGTNVELGGRLSIIAEQSNSTVDNQKQQHGALRNQGSRFHIKATHNFGDGFYAQGYLETRFVTKASENGSDNFGDITSKYAYVTLGNKAFGEVKLGRAKTIADGITSAEDKEYGVLNNSDYIPTSGNTVGYTFKGIDGLVLGANYLLAQKREGAKGENKRPNDKAGEVRIGEINNGIQVGAKYDANDIVAKIAYGRTNYKYNESDEHKQQLNGVLATLGYRFSDLGLLVSLDSGYAKTKNYKIKHEKRYFVSPGFQYELMEDTNVYGNFKYERTSVDQGEKTREQAVLFVDHKLHKQLLTYIEGAYARTRTTETGKGVKTEKEKSVGVGLRVYF		P20149			8	0	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
8480424	RNA binding of recombinant nucleocapsid proteins of hantaviruses.	Genes encoding the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of two hantaviruses, Hantaan virus strain 76-118 (HTN) and Puumala virus strain CG 18-20 (PUU), were expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine-tagged proteins. They were purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography under native or denaturing conditions to near homogeneity. The soluble form of HTN N protein was associated with RNA of E. coli. Renatured N proteins were shown to bind in vitro transcribed RNA representing the hantaviral small genomic (S) RNA segment. RNA binding was shown by affinity to filter-immobilized N proteins and by gel mobility shift assays. Competition experiments using tRNA, poly(U) and poly(A)+ U indicated that binding of RNA by the N protein is nonspecific. However, direct binding of ds-RNA resulted in efficient formation of large complexes suggesting that double-stranded nucleic acids are bound preferentially. Carboxyterminal fragments of HTN and PUU N proteins containing about 100 amino acids of the carboxy termini retained full binding capacity indicating that RNA binding occurs via a carboxyterminal domain.	1993 May	Gött P,Stohwasser R,Schnitzler P,Darai G,Bautz E K	Virology. 194(1) 332-7	Cerastocytin also known as  Proaggregant serine proteinase	VIGGAECNINEHRSLVLLYNSSRLFGGGTLINKEWVLSAAHCDGENMKIYLGLHHFRLPNKDRQIRVAKEKYFCRDRKSIVDKDIMLIKLNKPVNNSTHIAPLSLPSSPPSVGSDCRIMGWGTITSPNDTYPKVPHCANINILEHSLCERAYNDLSASSRTLCAGIEKGGIDTCKGDSGGPLICNGQIQGIVSWGDEVCGKPNKPGVYTKVFDYTDWIRNIIAGNTAATCPQ		Q7SYF1			9.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9989947	Inhibition of 3C protease from human rhinovirus strain 1B by peptidyl bromomethylketonehydrazides.	The gene coding for the 3C protease from human rhinovirus strain 1B was efficiently expressed in an Escherichia coli strain which also overexpressed the rare argU tRNA. The protease was isolated from inclusion bodies, refolded, and exhibited a kcat/Km = 3280 M-1 s-1 using an internally quenched peptidyl fluorogenic substrate. This continuous fluorogenic assay was used to measure the kinetics of 3C protease inhibition by several conventional peptidyl chloromethylketones as well as a novel series of compounds, the bromomethylketonehydrazides. Compounds containing the bromomethylketonehydrazide backbone and a glutamine-like side chain at the P1 position were potent, time-dependent inhibitors of rhinovirus 3C protease with kinact/Kinact values as high as 23,400 M-1 s-1. The inhibitory activity of compounds containing modified P1 side chains suggests that the interactions between the P1 carboxamide group and the 3C protease contributes at least 30-fold to the kinact/Kinact rate constants for bromomethylketonehydrazide inhibition of 3C protease. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry measurements of the molecular weights of native and inhibited 3C protease have established an inhibitory mechanism involving formation of a covalent adduct between the enzyme and the inhibitor with the loss of a bromide ion from the bromomethylketonehydrazide. Tryptic digestion of bromomethylketonehydrazide-inhibited 3C protease established adduct formation to a peptide corresponding to residues 145-154, a region which contains the active site cysteine-148 residue. The bromomethylketonehydrazides were fairly weak inhibitors of chymotrypsin, human elastase, and cathepsin B and several of these compounds also showed evidence for inhibition of human rhinovirus 1B replication in cell culture.	1999 Feb	Kati W M,Sham H L,McCall J O,Montgomery D A,Wang G T,Rosenbrook W,Miesbauer L,Buko A,Norbeck D W	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 362(2) 363-75	Protease 3C	GPGFDYAVAMAKRNIVTATTSKGEFTMLGVHDNVAILPTHASPGESIVIDGKEVEILDAKALEDQAGTNLEITIITLKRNEKFRDIRQHIPTQITETNDGVLIVNTSKYPNMYVPVGAVTEQGYLNLGGRQTARILMYNFPTRAGQCGGVITCTGKVIGMHVGGNGSHGFAAALKRSYFTQSQ		P03302			7.9	0	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16083870	Production of biologically active recombinant human soluble CD23 and its effect on PBMCs isolated from hyper-IgE blood.	A recombinant form of human soluble CD23 (sCD23), the low affinity receptor for IgE (FcepsilonRII), was produced by PCR cloning the lectin-binding domain sequence into a bacterial expression vector. After renaturation and purification, the sCD23 bound IgE and divalent metal ions, indicating its activity. The recombinant human sCD23 exhibited similar proinflammatory properties as the native protein. Although interleukin-1beta, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and nuclear factor-kappaB appeared not to be enhanced significantly in unstimulated RPMI 8866 B-lymphoblastoid and U937 promonocytic cell lines with 24 h incubation of recombinant sCD23, they were produced in both healthy and hyper-IgE-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells, especially tumour necrosis factor-alpha. This study concludes that while recombinant and chimeric sCD23 may be useful in blocking IgE binding to immune cells and decreasing IgE synthesis by B-lymphocytes, the production of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly tumour necrosis factor-alpha will enhance immune responses in cases of asthma, allergy, and hyper-IgE syndrome.	2005 Apr	Daniels Brodie B,Askew Sandra L,van de Venter Maryna,Oosthuizen Vaughan	Cellular immunology. 234(2) 146-53	CD23 antigen Also known as Low affinity immunoglobulin epsilon Fc receptor	MELQVSSGFVCNTCPEKWINFQRKCYYFGKGTKQWVHARYACDDMEGQLVSIHSPEEQDFLTKHASHTGSWIGLRNLDLKGEFIWVDGSHVDYSNWAPGEPTSRSQGEDCVMMRGSGRWNDAFCDRKLGAWVCDRLATCTPPASEGSAESMGPDSRPDPDGRLPTPSAPLHS		P06734			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12182829	Synthesis of cholera toxin B subunit gene: cloning and expression of a functional 6XHis-tagged protein in Escherichia coli.	Cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) has been extensively studied as immunogen, adjuvant, and oral tolerance inductor depending on the antigen conjugated or coadministered. It has been already expressed in several bacterial and yeast systems. In this study, we synthesized a versatile gene coding a 6XHis-tagged CTB (359bp). The sequence was designed according to codon usage of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus casei, and Salmonella typhimurium. The gene assembly was based on a polymerase chain reaction, in which the polymerase extends DNA fragments from a pool of overlapping oligonucleotides. The synthetic gene was amplified, cloned, and expressed in E. coli in an insoluble form, reaching levels about 13 mg of purified active pentameric rCTB per liter of induced culture. Western blot and ELISA analyses showed that recombinant CTB is strongly and specifically recognized by polyclonal antibodies against the cholera toxin. The ability to form the functional pentamers was observed in cell culture by the inhibition of cholera toxin activity on Y1 adrenal cells in the presence of recombinant CTB. The 6XHis-tagged CTB provides a simple way to obtain functional CTB through Ni(2+)-charged resin after refolding and also free of possible CTA contaminants as in the case of CTB obtained from Vibrio cholerae cultures.	2002 Aug	Arêas Ana Paula de Mattos,Oliveira Maria Leonor Sarno de,Ramos Celso Raul Romero,Sbrogio-Almeida Maria Elisabete,Raw Isaías,Ho Paulo Lee	Protein expression and purification. 25(3) 481-7	Cholera enterotoxin subunit B Also known as Cholera toxin B subunit	TPQNITDLCAEYHNTQIYTLNDKIFSYTESLAGKREMAIITFKNGAIFQVEVPGSQHIDSQKKAIERMKDTLRIAYLTEAKVEKLCVWNNKTPHAIAAISMAN	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P01556				25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15680247	Expression and spectroscopic characterization of a large fragment of the mu-opioid receptor.	We report here a procedure for the production in Escherichia coli and subsequent purification and characterization of an 80-residue fragment of the human mu-opioid receptor. The fragment (&#39;TM2-3&#39;), which comprises the second and third transmembrane segments as well as the first extracellular loop of the receptor, was expressed as a fusion with glutathione-S-transferase. The fusion protein, which accumulated in insoluble inclusion bodies, was solubilized with N-lauroylsarcosine, and TM2-3 was obtained by thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein followed by reversed-phase HPLC purification. CD spectroscopy of TM2-3 in lysophosphatidylcholine micelles showed that TM2-3 adopts approximately 50% alpha-helical structure in this environment, with the remainder consisting of disordered and/or beta-structure. This is consistent with the assumption of an alpha-helical structure by the two membrane-spanning regions and a nonhelical structure in the loop region of TM2-3. Fluorescence spectroscopy and fluorescence quenching experiments suggested that the extracellular loop lies near the surface of the lysophosphatidylcholine micelle. Our work shows that the study of large receptor fragments is a technically accessible approach to the study of the structural properties of the mu-opioid receptor and, possibly, other G-protein-coupled receptors as well.	2005 Feb	Kerman Aaron,Ananthanarayanan Vettai S	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1747(1) 133-40	Mu-type opioid receptor	YTKMKTATNIYIFNLALADALATSTLPFQSVNYLMGTWPFGTILCKIVISIDYYNMFTSIFTLCTMSVDRYIAVCHPVK	N-terminal GST	P35372		Topological domain polypeptide containing residues 97窶・76		0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
9758661	Solubilization of recombinant ovine growth hormone with retention of native-like secondary structure and its refolding from the inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli.	Ovine growth hormone was expressed in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies using the pQE-30 expression vector. In a simple fed-batch fermentation, 800 mg/L of recombinant ovine growth hormone (r-oGH) was produced at a cell concentration of 12 g dry cell weight/L. Inclusion bodies were isolated from cells with &gt;95d0c850urity by extensive washing using detergent, and the r-oGH from the purified inclusion bodies was solubilized in 2 M Tris-HCl buffer at pH 12 containing 2 M urea. The r-oGH solubilized in the above conditions exhibited considerable secondary structure as determined by circular dichroism spectra and was immunologically active. Solubilization of the inclusion body protein with retention of native-like secondary structure gave higher yields during refolding. To suppress protein aggregation, refolding was carried out in gel filtration column. Refolding, buffer exchange, and the purification of monomeric r-oGH from aggregated complex was achieved in a single step using gel filtration chromatography. More than 600f the initial inclusion body protein was refolded into a native-like conformation by the use of this procedure. The refolded protein was characterized by circular dichroism, fluorescence, SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and radio receptor binding assay and found to be similar to native, pituitary-derived, ovine growth hormone.

It catalyzes the conversion of 4-aminobutyrate to succinic semialdehyde. In an effort to clarify the structure-function relationships of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, we analyzed 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase cDNA from pig brain. The inclusion bodies were formed when recombinant 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The unfolded overproduced proteins, were purified by hydroxylapatite chromatography in the presence of urea and refolded by a sequential dialysis method. The renatured protein regained its catalytic activity. The lysyl residue at the 330 position of the amino-acid sequence serves as the anchoring site of the cofactor pyridoxal 5&#39;-P. To verify the catalytic site of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, lysine 330 was mutated to arginine by site-specific mutagenesis. Overexpression and purification of the mutated 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (K330R) were performed by the same method used the purification of wild-type 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase. The purified and renatured K330R protein did not show the catalytic activity of wild type 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase. Furthermore, the mutated protein did not show any absorption band over the spectral range of 320-460 nm characteristic of pyridoxal 5&#39;-P covalently linked to the protein. From the results presented here, it is concluded that lysine 330 is essential for the catalytic function of the aminotransferase.	1997 Feb	Kim Y T,Song Y H,Churchich J E	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1337(2) 248-56	4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, mitochondrial also known as  GABA transaminase	SQAAAKVDVEFDYDGPLMKTEVPGPRSRELMKQLNIIQNAEAVHFFCNYEESRGNYLVDVDGNRMLDLYSQISSIPIGYSHPALVKLVQQPQNVSTFINRPALGILPPENFVEKLRESLLSVAPKGMSQLITMACGSCSNENAFKTIFMWYRSKERGQSAFSKEELETCMINQAPGCPDYSILSFMGAFHGRTMGCLATTHSKAIHKIDIPSFDWPIAPFPRLKYPLEEFVKENQQEEARCLEEVEDLIVKYRKKKKTVAGIIVEPIQSEGGDNHASDDFFRKLRDISRKHGCAFLVDEVQTGGGSTGKFWAHEHWGLDDPADVMTFSKKMMTGGFFHKEEFRPNAPYRIFNTWLGDPSKNLLLAEVINIIKREDLLSNAAHAGKVLLTGLLDLQARYPQFISRVRGRGTFCSFDTPDESIRNKLISIARNKGVMLGGCGDKSIRFRPTLVFRDHHAHLFLNIFSDILADFK	T7	P80147			7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12423367	Enzymic properties of recombinant BACE2.	BACE2 (Memapsin 1) is a membrane-bound aspartic protease that is highly homologous with BACE1 (Memapsin 2). While BACE1 processes the amyloid precursor protein (APP) at a key step in generating the beta-amyloid peptide and presumably causes Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD), BACE2 has not been demonstrated to be directly involved in APP processing, and its physiological functions remain to be determined. In vivo, BACE2 is expressed as a precursor protein containing pre-, pro-, protease, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains/peptides. To determine the enzymatic properties of BACE2, two variants of its pro-protease domain, pro-BACE2-T1 (PB2-T1) and pro-BACE2-T2 (PB2-T2), were constructed. They have been expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, refolded and purified. These two recombinant proteins have the same N terminus but differ at their C-terminal ends: PB2-T1 ends at Pro466, on the boundary of the postulated transmembrane domain, and PB2-T2 ends at Ser431, close to the homologous ends of other aspartic proteases such as pepsin. While PB2-T1 shares similar substrate specificities with BACE1 and other &#39;general&#39; aspartic proteases, the specificity of PB2-T2 is more constrained, apparently preferring to cleave at the NH2-terminal side of paired basic residues. Unlike other &#39;typical&#39; aspartic proteases, which are active only under acidic conditions, the recombinant BACE2, PB2-T1, was active at a broad pH range. In addition, pro-BACE2 can be processed at its in vivo maturation site by BACE1.	2002 Nov	Kim Yong-Tae,Downs Deborah,Wu Shili,Dashti Azar,Pan Yujun,Zhai Peng,Wang Xinjuan,Zhang Xuejun C,Lin Xinli	European journal of biochemistry / FEBS. 269(22) 5668-77	Beta-secretase 2 also known as  Memapsin-1	MGALARALLLPLLAQWLLRAAPELAPAPFTLPLRVAAATNRVVAPTPGPGTPAERHADGLALALEPALASPAGAANFLAMVDNLQGDSGRGYYLEMLIGTPPQKLQILVDTGSSNFAVAGTPHSYIDTYFDTERSSTYRSKGFDVTVKYTQGSWTGFVGEDLVTIPKGFNTSFLVNIATIFESENFFLPGIKWNGILGLAYATLAKPSSSLETFFDSLVTQANIPNVFSMQMCGAGLPVAGSGTNGGSLVLGGIEPSLYKGDIWYTPIKEEWYYQIEILKLEIGGQSLNLDCREYNADKAIVDSGTTLLRLPQKVFDAVVEAVARASLIPEFSDGFWTGSQLACWTNSETPWSYFPKISIYLRDENSSRSFRITILPQLYIQPMMGAGLNYECYRFGISPSTNALVIGATVMEGFYVIFDRAQKRVGFAASPCAEIAGAAVSEISGPFSTEDVASNCVPAQSLSEPILWIVSYALMSVCGAILLVLIVLLLLPFRCQRRPRDPEVVNDESSLVRHRWK	N-terminal T7 tag	Q9Y5Z0			8	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
11705650	Serodiagnosis of Toxoplasma gondii infection in cats by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant SAG1.	The gene encoding surface antigen 1 (SAG1, P30) of Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) was cloned into the plasmid pGEX-4T-3 and subsequently expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) as a glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The recombinant SAG1 (rSAG1) was refolded using 8M urea solution followed by dialysis and thereafter evaluated in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for serological diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. The test sera were adsorbed with GST to block non-specific reactivity to the GST-SAG1 fusion protein. The ELISA with rSAG1 was able to differentiate very clearly between sera from cats or mice experimentally infected with T. gondii and sera from normal cats or mice. The ELISA detected no cross-reactivity with sera from mice experimentally infected with the closely related parasite Neospora caninum (N. caninum). Some 193 cat sera were tested for antibodies to T. gondii, out of which 40 (20.7%) reacted positively by ELISA with the rSAG1 while another 79.3cats reacted negative to the assay. Both positive and negative sera were confirmed by Western blot analysis. The results of ELISA were in agreement with those of a commercially available latex agglutination test (LAT) kit, although the former had higher titers than the latter.	2001 Dec	Kimbita E N,Xuan X,Huang X,Miyazawa T,Fukumoto S,Mishima M,Suzuki H,Sugimoto C,Nagasawa H,Fujisaki K,Suzuki N,Mikami T,Igarashi I	Veterinary parasitology. 102(1-2) 35-44	SAG1 protein also known as P30	MSVSLHHFIISSGFLTSMFPKAVRRAVTAGVFAAPTLMSFLRCGAMASDPPLVANQVVTCPDKKSTAAVILTPTENHFTLKCPKTALTEPPTLAYSPNRQICPAGTTSSCTSKAVTLSSLIPEAEDSWWTGDSASLDTAGIKLTVPIEKFPVTTQTFVVGCIKGDDAQSCMVTVTVQARASSVVNNVARCSYGANSTLGPVKLSAEGPTTMTLVCGKDGVKVPQDNNQYCSGTTLTGCNEKSFKDILPKLSENPWQGNASSDNGATLTINKEAFPAESKSVIIGCTGGSPEKHHCTVQLEFAGAAGSAKSSAGTASHVSIFAMVTGLIGSIAACVA	GST	Q27298			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12815039	Tissue expression, protease specificity, and Kunitz domain functions of hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1B (HAI-1B), a new splice variant of HAI-1.	Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 (HAI-1) is an integral membrane protein expressed on epithelial cells and contains two extracellular Kunitz domains (N-terminal KD1 and C-terminal KD2) known to inhibit trypsin-like serine proteases. In tumorigenesis and tissue regeneration, HAI-1 regulates the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met pathway by inhibiting the activity of HGF activator (HGFA) and matriptase, two serine proteases that convert pro-HGF into its biologically active form. By screening a placental cDNA library, we discovered a new splice variant of HAI-1 designated HAI-1B that contains an extra 16 amino acids adjacent to the C terminus of KD1. To investigate possible consequences on Kunitz domain function, a soluble form of HAI-1B (sHAI-1B) comprising the entire extracellular domain was produced. First, we found that sHAI-1B displayed remarkable enzyme specificity by potently inhibiting only HGFA (IC50 = 30.5 nm), matriptase (IC50 = 16.5 nm), and trypsin (IC50 = 2.4 nm) among 16 serine proteases examined, including plasminogen activators (urokinase- and tissue-type plasminogen activators), coagulation enzymes thrombin, factors VIIa, Xa, XIa, and XIIa, and activated protein C. Relatively weak inhibition was found for plasmin (IC50 = 399 nm) and plasma kallikrein (IC50 = 686 nm). Second, the functions of the KD1 and KD2 domains in sHAI-1B were investigated using P1 residue-directed mutagenesis to show that inhibition of HGFA, matriptase, trypsin, and plasmin was due to KD1 and not KD2. Furthermore, analysis by reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that HAI-1B and HAI-1 were co-expressed in normal tissues and various epithelial-derived cancer cell lines. Both isoforms were up-regulated in eight examined ovarian carcinoma specimens, three of which had higher levels of HAI-1B RNA than of HAI-1 RNA. Therefore, previously demonstrated roles of HAI-1 in various physiological and pathological processes likely involve both HAI-1B and HAI-1.	2003 Sep	Kirchhofer Daniel,Peek Mark,Li Wei,Stamos Jennifer,Eigenbrot Charles,Kadkhodayan Saloumeh,Elliott J Michael,Corpuz Racquel T,Lazarus Robert A,Moran Paul	The Journal of biological chemistry. 278(38) 36341-9	Matriptase also known as Suppressor of tumorigenicity protein 14	MGSDRARKGGGGPKDFGAGLKYNSRHEKVNGLEEGVEFLPVNNVKKVEKHGPGRWVVLAAVLIGLLLVLLGIGFLVWHLQYRDVRVQKVFNGYMRITNENFVDAYENSNSTEFVSLASKVKDALKLLYSGVPFLGPYHKESAVTAFSEGSVIAYYWSEFSIPQHLVEEAERVMAEERVVMLPPRARSLKSFVVTSVVAFPTDSKTVQRTQDNSCSFGLHARGVELMRFTTPGFPDSPYPAHARCQWALRGDADSVLSLTFRSFDLASCDERGSDLVTVYNTLSPMEPHALVQLCGTYPPSYNLTFHSSQNVLLITLITNTERRHPGFEATFFQLPRMSSCGGRLRKAQGTFNSPYYPGHYPPNIDCTWNIEVPNNQHVKVRFKFFYLLEPGVPAGTCPKDYVEINGEKYCGERSQFVVTSNSNKITVRFHSDQSYTDTGFLAEYLSYDSSDPCPGQFTCRTGRCIRKELRCDGWADCTDHSDELNCSCDAGHQFTCKNKFCKPLFWVCDSVNDCGDNSDEQGCSCPAQTFRCSNGKCLSKSQQCNGKDDCGDGSDEASCPKVNVVTCTKHTYRCLNGLCLSKGNPECDGKEDCSDGSDEKDCDCGLRSFTRQARVVGGTDADEGEWPWQVSLHALGQGHICGASLISPNWLVSAAHCYIDDRGFRYSDPTQWTAFLGLHDQSQRSAPGVQERRLKRIISHPFFNDFTFDYDIALLELEKPAEYSSMVRPICLPDASHVFPAGKAIWVTGWGHTQYGGTGALILQKGEIRVINQTTCENLLPQQITPRMMCVGFLSGGVDSCQGDSGGPLSSVEADGRIFQAGVVSWGDGCAQRNKPGVYTRLPLFRDWIKENTGV	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9Y5Y6			8.6	8	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9710540	The effect of regulatory Ca2+ on the in situ structures of troponin C and troponin I: a neutron scattering study.	The effects of regulatory amounts of Ca2+ on the in situ structures of troponin C (TnC) and troponin I (TnI) in whole troponin have been investigated by neutron scattering. In separate difference experiments, 97 0euterated TnC and TnI within whole troponin were studied +/-Ca2+ in 41.6% 2H2O buffers in which protonated subunits were rendered &quot;invisible&quot;. We found that the radius of gyration (Rg) of TnI decreased by approximately 100pon addition of regulatory Ca2+ indicating that it was significantly more compact in the presence of Ca2+. The apparent cross-sectional radius of gyration (Rc) of TnI increased by about 9% when regulatory Ca2+ was bound to TnC. Modeling studies showed that the high-Q scattering patterns of TnI could be fit by a TnI which consisted of two subdomains: one, a highly oblate ellipsoid of revolution containing about 650f the mass and the other, a highly prolate ellipsoid of revolution consisting of about 350f the mass. No other fits could be found with this class of models. Best fits were achieved when the axes of revolution of these ellipsoids were steeply inclined with respect to each other. Ca2+ addition decreased the center of mass separation by about 1.5 nm. The Rg of TnI, its high-Q scattering pattern, and the resultant structure were different from previous results on neutron scattering by TnI in the (+Ca2+) TnC.TnI complex. The Rg of TnC indicated that it was elongate in situ. The Rg of TnC was not sensitive to the Ca2+ occupancy of its regulatory sites. However, Rc increased upon Ca2+ addition in concert with expectations from NMR and crystallography of isolated TnC. The present observations indicate that TnI acts like a molecular switch which is controlled by smaller Ca2+-induced changes in TnC.	1998 Aug	Stone D B,Timmins P A,Schneider D K,Krylova I,Ramos C H,Reinach F C,Mendelson R A	Journal of molecular biology. 281(4) 689-704	Troponin T, fast skeletal muscle isoforms	SDTEEVEHGEEEYEEEAHEAEEVHEEEVHEPAPPPEEAPEEEEKPRIKLTAPKIPEGEKVDFDDIQKKRQNKDLIELQALIDSHFEARRKEEEELVALKERIEKRRAERAEQQRIRAEKEKERQARLAEEKARREEEDAKRKAEDDLKKKKALSSMGASYSSYLAKADQKRGKKQTARETKKKVLAERRKPLNIDHLNEDKLRDKAKELWDWLYQLQTEKYDFAEQIKRKKYEIVTLRNRIDQAQKHSKKAGAKGKVGGRWK		P12620			6	0	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15964548	Characterization of the PR domain of RIZ1 histone methyltransferase.	RIZ1 (PRDM2) and PRDI-BF1 (PRDM1) are involved in B cell differentiation and the development of B cell lymphomas. These proteins are expressed in two forms that differ by the presence or absence of a PR domain. The protein product that retains the PR domain is anti-tumorigenic while the product that lacks the PR domain is oncogenic and over-expressed in tumor cells. The conserved PR domain is homologous to the SET domain from a family of histone methyltransferases. RIZ1 is also a histone methyltransferase and methylates lysine 9 in histone H3. This activity has been mapped to the PR domain. In the present study, deuterium exchange mass spectrometry was used to define the structural boundaries of the RIZ1 PR domain and to map sites of missense mutations that occur in human cancers and reduce methyltransferase activity. Flexible segments were selectively deleted to produce protein products that crystallize for structural studies. Segments at the carboxyl terminus of the PR domain that are involved in methylation of H3 were shown to be flexible, similar to SET domains, suggesting that the PR and SET methyltransferases may belong to an emerging class of proteins that contain mobile functional regions.	2005 Aug	Derunes Céline,Briknarová Klára,Geng Liqing,Li Sheng,Gessner Chris R,Hewitt Krissi,Wu ShuangDing,Huang Shi,Woods Virgil I,Ely Kathryn R	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 333(3) 925-34	PR domain-containing protein 2 Also known as Zinc finger protein RIZ	MNQNTTEPVAATETLAEVPEHVLRGLPEEVRLFPSAVDKTRIGVWATKPILKGKKFGPFVGDKKKRSQVKNNVYMWEVYYPNLGWMCIDATDPEKGNWLRYVNWACSGEEQNLFPLEINRAIYYKTLKPIAPGEELLVWYNGEDNPEIAAIEEERASARSKRSSPKSRKGKKKSQENKNKGNKIQDIQLKTSEPDFTSANMRDSAEGPKEDEEKPSASALEQPATLQEVASQEVPPELATPAPAWEPQPEPDERLEAAACEVNDLGEEEEEEEEEDEEEEEDDDDDELEDEGEEEASMPNENSVKEPEIRCDEKPEDLLEE	GST	Q13029		RIZ-PR-A	6.8	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
16415011	Antibodies against West Nile Virus nonstructural protein NS1 prevent lethal infection through Fc gamma receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.	The flavivirus nonstructural protein NS1 is a highly conserved secreted glycoprotein that does not package with the virion. Immunization with NS1 elicits a protective immune response against yellow fever, dengue, and tick-borne encephalitis flaviviruses through poorly defined mechanisms. In this study, we purified a recombinant, secreted form of West Nile virus (WNV) NS1 glycoprotein from baculovirus-infected insect cells and generated 22 new NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). By performing competitive binding assays and expressing truncated NS1 proteins on the surface of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in bacteria, we mapped 21 of the newly generated MAbs to three NS1 fragments. Prophylaxis of C57BL/6 mice with any of four MAbs (10NS1, 14NS1, 16NS1, and 17NS1) strongly protected against lethal WNV infection (75 to 95urvival, respectively) compared to saline-treated controls (17urvival). In contrast, other anti-NS1 MAbs of the same isotype provided no significant protection. Notably, 14NS1 and 16NS1 also demonstrated marked efficacy as postexposure therapy, even when administered as a single dose 4 days after infection. Virologic analysis showed that 17NS1 protects at an early stage in infection through a C1q-independent and Fc gamma receptor-dependent pathway. Interestingly, 14NS1, which maps to a distinct region on NS1, protected through a C1q- and Fc gamma receptor-independent mechanism. Overall, our data suggest that distinct regions of NS1 can elicit protective humoral immunity against WNV through different mechanisms.	2006 Feb	Chung Kyung Min,Nybakken Grant E,Thompson Bruce S,Engle Michael J,Marri Anantha,Fremont Daved H,Diamond Michael S	Journal of virology. 80(3) 1340-51	 Non-structural protein 1	DTGCAIDIGRQELRCGSGVFIHNDVEAWMDRYKFYPETPQGLAKIIQKAHAEGVCGLRSVSRLEHQMWEAIKDELNTLLKENGVDLSVVVEKQNGMYKAAPKRLAATTEKLEMGWKAWGKSIIFAPELANNTFVIDGPETEECPTANRAWNSMEVEDFGFGLTSTRMFLRIRETNTTECDSKIIGTAVKNNMAVHSDLSYWIESGLNDTWKLERAVLGEVKSCTWPETHTLWGDGVLESDLIIPITLAGPRSNHNRRPGYKTQNQGPWDEGRVEIDFDYCPGTTVTISDSCEHRGPAARTTTESGKLITDWCCRSCTLPPLRFQTENGCWYGMEIRPTRHDEKTLVQSRVNA	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P06935				0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16169851	Attenuating lymphocyte activity: the crystal structure of the BTLA-HVEM complex.	Five CD28-like proteins exert positive or negative effects on immune cells. Only four of these five receptors interact with members of the B7 family. The exception is BTLA (B and T lymphocyte attenuator), which instead interacts with the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member HVEM (herpes virus entry mediator). To better understand this interaction, we determined the 2.8-A crystal structure of the BTLA-HVEM complex. This structure shows that BTLA binds the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain of HVEM and employs a unique binding surface compared with other CD28-like receptors. Moreover, the structure shows that BTLA recognizes the same surface on HVEM as gD (herpes virus glycoprotein D) and utilizes a similar binding motif. Light scattering analysis demonstrates that the extracellular domain of BTLA is monomeric and that BTLA and HVEM form a 1:1 complex. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of HVEM was used to further define critical binding residues. Finally, BTLA adopts an immunoglobulin I-set fold. Despite structural similarities to other CD28-like members, BTLA represents a unique co-receptor.	2005 Nov	Compaan Deanne M,Gonzalez Lino C,Tom Irene,Loyet Kelly M,Eaton Dan,Hymowitz Sarah G	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(47) 39553-61	B and T lymphocyte attenuator variant also known as  BTLA protein	MKTLPAMLGTGKLFWVFFLIPYLDIWNIHGKESCDVQLYIKRQSEHSILAGDPFELECPVKYCANRPHVTWCKLNGTTCVKLEDRQTSWKEEKNISFFILHFEPVLPNDNGSYRCSANFQSNLIESHSTTLYVTGKQNELSDTAGREINLVDAHLKSEQTEASTRQNSQVLLSETGIYDNDPDLCFRMQEGSEVYSNPCLEENKPGIVYASLNHSVIGLNSRLARNVKEAPTEYASICVRS	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q3HS85			8.6	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11551116	Production, in vitro characterisation, in vivo clearance, and tissue localisation of recombinant barramundi (Lates calcarifer) insulin-like growth factor II.	Recombinant barramundi insulin-like growth-factor-II (bIGF-II) has been produced in Escherichia coli after modification of an expression plasmid that coded for a chicken IGF-II fusion protein. The bIGF-II fusion protein, deposited in bacterial inclusion bodies, was dissolved under reducing conditions, desalted, and refolded. The protein was then released from the fusion protein by cleavage with subtilisin BPN&#39;. Finally the protein was purified to homogeneity with a number of HPLC steps. In vitro analysis of recombinant bIGF-II demonstrated decreased potency in stimulating protein synthesis when compared to human and barramundi IGF-I (bIGF-I). The in vivo distribution of radiolabeled bIGF-II and bIGF-I in the circulation and tissue uptake of radiolabeled bIGF-II was also compared in juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer). Analysis of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in sequential samples following bolus injection of radiolabeled IGFs revealed that bIGF-II was degraded faster than bIGF-I. Moreover, neutral gel chromatography of these samples suggested this difference may be due to reduced affinity of bIGF-II, compared to blGF-I, for the IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) present in the barramundi circulation. Based on these results, it would appear that elements important in the function of IGFs have been well conserved during vertebrate evolution. However, to clearly define the IGF system in fish it will be necessary to characterise the IGFBPs present and to determine how they influence the biological actions of native IGFs.	2001 Jul	Degger B,Richardson N,Collet C,Upton Z	General and comparative endocrinology. 123(1) 38-50	Insulin-like growth factor II	METQQRHGQHSLCHTCRRAESSRMKVKKMSSSSRALLFALALTLYVVEMASAETLCGGELVDALQFVCEDRGFYFSRPTSRGSNRRPQNRGIVEECCFRSCDLNLLEQYCAKPAKSERDVSATSLQVIPVMPALKQEVPRKQHVTVKYSKYEVWQRKAAQRLRRGVPAILRAKKFRRQAEKIKAQEQVIFHRPLISLPSKLPPVLLTTDNYVNHK		O42429			8.5	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8480424	RNA binding of recombinant nucleocapsid proteins of hantaviruses.	Genes encoding the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of two hantaviruses, Hantaan virus strain 76-118 (HTN) and Puumala virus strain CG 18-20 (PUU), were expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine-tagged proteins. They were purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography under native or denaturing conditions to near homogeneity. The soluble form of HTN N protein was associated with RNA of E. coli. Renatured N proteins were shown to bind in vitro transcribed RNA representing the hantaviral small genomic (S) RNA segment. RNA binding was shown by affinity to filter-immobilized N proteins and by gel mobility shift assays. Competition experiments using tRNA, poly(U) and poly(A)+ U indicated that binding of RNA by the N protein is nonspecific. However, direct binding of ds-RNA resulted in efficient formation of large complexes suggesting that double-stranded nucleic acids are bound preferentially. Carboxyterminal fragments of HTN and PUU N proteins containing about 100 amino acids of the carboxy termini retained full binding capacity indicating that RNA binding occurs via a carboxyterminal domain.	1993 May	Gött P,Stohwasser R,Schnitzler P,Darai G,Bautz E K	Virology. 194(1) 332-7	Pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor	GNPPAEVNGKTPNCPKQIMGCPRIYDPVCGTNGITYPSECSLCFENRKFGTSIHIQRRGTC		P09655			8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16427023	Loosely packed papain prosegment displays inhibitory activity.	Most protease prosegments are co-synthesized at the N-termini of cysteine proteases and are involved in folding assistance, inhibition, and activation of their mature enzymes. By using circular dichroism, UV-difference and fluorescence spectroscopies, we studied the thermal unfolding of papain prosegment. The transition seems to be two-state and reversible, with an unfolded state prone to aggregation. Unfolding thermodynamic parameters obtained show low values both for deltaH(Tm) and deltaCp(U), indicative of a loosely packed three-dimensional conformation for the prosegment at near-neutral pH conditions. In spite of these results, fluorescence experiments demonstrate that papain prosegment is able to recognize and inhibit its cognate protease. An acid medium induces a molten globule-like state without intermediates, which in turn undergoes an irreversible thermal unfolding. Our results suggest that papain prosegment has a high degree of conformational flexibility, with the ability to form not only a molten globule-like structure in activating conditions, but also requiring an induced fit in order to be functional as inhibitor.	2006 Feb	Gutiérrez-González Luis H,Rojo-Domínguez Arturo,Cabrera-González Nallely E,Pérez-Montfort Ruy,Padilla-Zúñiga A Jaqueline	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 446(2) 151-60	Cathepsin L1 also known as papain prosegment	APRSVDWREKGYVTPVKNQGQCGSCWAFSATGALEGQMFRKTGRLISLSEQNLVDCSGPQGNEGCNGGLMDYAFQYVQDNGGLDSEESYPYEATEESCKYNPKYSVANDTGFVDIPKQEKALMKAVATVGPISVAIDAGHESFLFYKEGIYFEPDCSSEDMDHGVLVVGYGFESTNNKYWLVKNSWGEEWGMGGYVKMAKDRRNHCGIASAASYPTV		P07711			7	25	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
16361259	Nucleotide-binding domains of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, an ABC transporter, catalyze adenylate kinase activity but not ATP hydrolysis.	The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is an anion channel in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. CFTR consists of two transmembrane domains, two nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), and a regulatory domain. Previous biochemical reports suggest NBD1 is a site of stable nucleotide interaction with low ATPase activity, whereas NBD2 is the site of active ATP hydrolysis. It has also been reported that NBD2 additionally possessed adenylate kinase (AK) activity. Knowledge about the intrinsic biochemical activities of the NBDs is essential to understanding the Cl(-) ion gating mechanism. We find that purified mouse NBD1, human NBD1, and human NBD2 function as adenylate kinases but not as ATPases. AK activity is strictly dependent on the addition of the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) substrate. No liberation of [(33)P]phosphate is observed from the gamma-(33)P-labeled ATP substrate in the presence or absence of AMP. AK activity is intrinsic to both human NBDs, as the Walker A box lysine mutations abolish this activity. At low protein concentration, the NBDs display an initial slower nonlinear phase in AK activity, suggesting that the activity results from homodimerization. Interestingly, the G551D gating mutation has an exaggerated nonlinear phase compared with the wild type and may indicate this mutation affects the ability of NBD1 to dimerize. hNBD1 and hNBD2 mixing experiments resulted in an 8-57-fold synergistic enhancement in AK activity suggesting heterodimer formation, which supports a common theme in ABC transporter models. A CFTR gating mechanism model based on adenylate kinase activity is proposed.	2006 Feb	Gross Christian H,Abdul-Manan Norzehan,Fulghum John,Lippke Judith,Liu Xun,Prabhakar Prakash,Brennan Debra,Willis Melissa Swope,Faerman Carlos,Connelly Patrick,Raybuck Scott,Moore Jonathan	The Journal of biological chemistry. 281(7) 4058-68	Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator	TEVVMENVTAFWEEGFGELFEKAKQNNNNRKTSNGDDSLFFSNFSLLGTPVLKDINFKIERGQLLAVAGSTGAGKTSLLMVIMGELEPSEGKIKHSGRISFCSQFSWIMPGTIKENIIFGVSYDEYRYRSVIKACQLEEDISKFAEKDNIVLGEGGITLSGGQRARISLARAVYKDADLYLLDSPFGYLDVLTEKEIFESCVCKLMANKTRILVTSKMEHLKKADKILILHEGSSYFYGTFSELQNLQPDFSSKLMGCDSFDQFSAERRNSILTETLHRFSLKDDIWPSGGQMTVKDLTAKYTEGGNAILENISFSISPGQRVGLLGRTGSGKSTLLSAFLRLLNTEGEIQIDGVSWDSITLQQWRKAFGVIPQKVFIFSGTFRKNLDPYEQWSDQEIWKVADEVGLRSVIEQFPGKLDFVLVDGGCVLSHGHKQLMCLARSVLSKAKILLLDEPSAHLDPVTYQIIRRTLKQAFADCTVILCEHRIEAMLECQQFLVIEENKVRQYDSIQKLLNERSLFRQAISPSDRVKLFPHRNSSKCKSKPQIAALKEETEEEVQDTRL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P13569		CFTR NBD	7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8480424	RNA binding of recombinant nucleocapsid proteins of hantaviruses.	Genes encoding the nucleocapsid (N) proteins of two hantaviruses, Hantaan virus strain 76-118 (HTN) and Puumala virus strain CG 18-20 (PUU), were expressed in Escherichia coli as histidine-tagged proteins. They were purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography under native or denaturing conditions to near homogeneity. The soluble form of HTN N protein was associated with RNA of E. coli. Renatured N proteins were shown to bind in vitro transcribed RNA representing the hantaviral small genomic (S) RNA segment. RNA binding was shown by affinity to filter-immobilized N proteins and by gel mobility shift assays. Competition experiments using tRNA, poly(U) and poly(A)+ U indicated that binding of RNA by the N protein is nonspecific. However, direct binding of ds-RNA resulted in efficient formation of large complexes suggesting that double-stranded nucleic acids are bound preferentially. Carboxyterminal fragments of HTN and PUU N proteins containing about 100 amino acids of the carboxy termini retained full binding capacity indicating that RNA binding occurs via a carboxyterminal domain.	1993 May	Gött P,Stohwasser R,Schnitzler P,Darai G,Bautz E K	Virology. 194(1) 332-7	Nucleoprotein	MATMEELQREINAHEGQLVIARQKVRDAEKQYEKDPDELNKRTLTDREGVAVSIQAKIDELKRQLADRIATGKNLGKEQDPTGVEPGDHLKERSMLSYGNVLDLNHLDIDEPTGQTADWLSIIVYLTSFVVPILLKALYMLTTRGRQTTKDNKGTRIRFKDDSSFEDVNGIRKPKHLYVSLPNAQSSMKAEEITPGRYRTAVCGLYPAQIKARQMISPVMSVIGFLALAKDWSDRIEQWLIEPCKLLPDTAAVSLLGGPATNRDYLRQRQVALGNMETKESKAIRQHAEAAGCSMIEDIESPSSIWVFAGAPDRCPPTCLFIAGIAELGAFFSILQDMRNTIMASKTVGTSEEKLRKKSSFYQSYLRRTQSMGIQLGQRIIVLFMVAWGKEAVDNFHLGDDMDPELRTLAQSLIDVKVKEISNQEPLKL	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P05133				0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11722187	Cloning and functional expression of the mucrosobin protein, a beta-fibrinogenase of Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus (Taiwan Habu).	A venom-specific cDNA encoding for a thrombin-like enzyme designated as mucrosobin has been cloned and sequenced from the cDNA library of the venomous gland of Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus. The full-length cDNA of mucrosobin was assembled by oligonucleotide screening and 5&#39;-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA consists of 257 amino acid residues with a putative signal peptide of 24 residues. It is highly homologous to the other thrombin-like enzymes (batroxobin, mucofirase, and calobin), suggesting that it is a serine proteinase with a conserved catalytic triad of His(41), Asp(84) and Ser(179) in the deduced form of mucrosobin protein. Northern blot analysis revealed that the mucrosobin gene encodes an mRNA of 1.5 kb and suggested a tissue-specific expression in the venomous gland. In an effort to study the biological property of mocrosobin, we have expressed the 28-kDa protein as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. For analyzing enzymatic activity, the inclusion bodies were solubilized and the recombinant protein was refolded with a two-step dialysis protocol. The refolded recombinant protein exhibited a specific beta-fibrinogenolytic activity. This study offers a possibility of using genetic engineering to acquire a functional snake venom protein with therapeutic potential.	2001 Dec	Guo Y W,Chang T Y,Lin K T,Liu H W,Shih K C,Cheng S H	Protein expression and purification. 23(3) 483-90	Mucrosobin also known as Mucrofibrase-1	VIGGDECNINEHPFLVLVYYDDYQCGGTLLNEEWVLTAAHCNGKDMEIYLGVHSKKVPNKDVQRRVPKEKFFCDSSKTYTKWNKDIMLIRLDRPVRKSAHIAPLSLPSSPPSVGSVCRVMGWGTITSPQETYPDVPHCANINLLDYEVCRAAYAGLPATSRTLCAGILEGGKDSCVGDSGGPLICNGQFQGIVSWGGDPCAQPREPGVCTNVFDHLDWIKGIIAGNTDVTCPL	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q91507			8	22	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11305642	A genetically engineered fusion protein with horseradish peroxidase as a marker enzyme for use in competitive immunoassays.	Horseradish peroxidase is one of the most widely used marker enzymes in immunoassays. Several disadvantages are encountered upon chemical conjugation of peroxidase with antibodies or antigens, as are low reproducibility and undefined stoichiometry. We here describe for the first time the production of a recombinant fusion of a protein analyte with horseradish peroxidase in Escherichia coli, employing refolding of inclusion bodies and reconstitution with heme. The genetic fusion approach enables preparation of conjugates with 1:1 stoichiometry and defined structure. As a protein analyte, the human heart fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) was chosen, which is a new and sensitive marker for acute myocardial infarction. The recombinant conjugate was fully active [650 U/mg with 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethyl-thiazoline-6-sulfonate) as substrate] and obtained in a yield of 12 mg/L of E. coli culture, which is better than that for recombinant peroxidase alone. The competitive immunoassay that was developed with the recombinant conjugate requires fewer incubation steps than the traditional sandwich ELISA format. It permitted the detection of H-FABP directly in plasma in the range of 10-1500 ng/mL which is the relevant range for clinical decision-making.	2001 Mar	Grigorenko V,Andreeva I,Börchers T,Spener F,Egorov A	Analytical chemistry. 73(6) 1134-9	HRP/Fatty acid-binding protein, heart fusion	VDAFLGTWKLVDSKNFDDYMKSLGVGFATRQVASMTKPTTIIEKNGDILTLKTHSTFKNTEISFKLGVEFDETTADDRKVKSIVTLDGGKLVHLQKWDGQETTLVRELIDGKLILTLTHGTAVCTRTYEKEA	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P05413			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16132856	Recombinant bacterial expression of the lysozyme from the tobacco-hornworm Manduca sexta with activity at low temperatures.	A gene coding for lysozyme from the insect Manduca sexta (Ms-lyz) was expressed in Escherichia coli. The protein was produced as an insoluble cytoplasmic inclusion body which was denatured in 8 M: guanidine-HCl, renatured and purified by affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. The N-terminal sequence and the activity of the recombinant protein against Micrococcus luteus confirmed that correct expression had occurred. When Ms-lyz activity was compared to hen egg white lysozyme, the insect lysozyme was active at lower temperatures. These results demonstrate the feasibility of producing a disulfide-bonded lysozyme enzyme in bacteria and suggest that the insect Ms-lyz is an interesting system for further development of an antibacterial functional at low temperatures.	2005 Aug	García-Orozco Karina D,López-Zavala Alonso A,Puentes-Camacho Daniel,Calderón-de-la-Barca Ana Maria,Sotelo-Mundo Rogerio R	Biotechnology letters. 27(15) 1075-80	Lysozyme	MYKLVIFALFAFAYHSEAKHFSRCELVHELRRQGFPENLMRDWVCLVENESSRYTDKVGRVNKNGSRDYGLFQINDKYWCSNGSTPGKDCNVKCSDLLIDDITKASTCAKKIYKRHKFQAWYGWRNHCQGSLPDISSC		Q26363			8.5	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
11911461	Refolding of the catalytic and hinge domains of human MT1-mMP expressed in Escherichia coli and its characterization.	The catalytic and hinge domain (Tyr112-Ile318) of the human membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP; MMP-14), containing hexa-histidines at the C-terminus (chMT1-MMP), was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed polypeptide was almost exclusively found in the inclusion body, and then purified by a single Ni2+-NTA agarose column chromatography after solubilization with 6 M urea. During refolding, the 26.9 kDa chMT1-MMP was processed to a 24.3 kDa intermediate form and then to a 22.2 kDa mature form. By Western blot analysis and mass spectrometry combined with N-terminal sequencing, the intermediate form was identified as a mixture of the Tyr112-Thr299 with a translation-initiating methionine and Ile114-Thr299, and that the mature form corresponds to Ile114-Pro290. These results demonstrate that the mature form was generated by successive autoproteolysis of the N- and C-terminal sites between Thr299-Thr300, Ala113-Ile114, and Pro290-Thr291 during refolding. Catalytic activity of the mature chMT1-MMP was demonstrated by a peptide cleavage assay. In addition, it has gelatinolytic activity and is able to activate proMMP-2 to the mature MMP-2. These results indicate that the refolded chMT1-MMP retains characteristics of MT1-MMP.	2002 Feb	Koo Hyun Min,Kim Joo-Hyon,Hwang In Kwan,Lee Seo-Jin,Kim Tae-Han,Rhee Ki-Hyeong,Lee Seung-Taek	Molecules and cells. 13(1) 118-24	Matrix metalloproteinase-14 Also known as  MMP-14	YAIQGLKWQHNEITFCIQNYTPKVGEYATYEAIRKAFRVWESATPLRFREVPYAYIREGHEKQADIMIFFAEGFHGDSTPFDGEGGFLAHAYFPGPNIGGDTHFDSAEPWTVRNEDLNGNDIFLVAVHELGHALGLEHSSDPSAIMAPFYQWMDTENFVLPDDDRRGIQQLYGGESGFPTKMPPQPRTTSRPSVPDKPKNPTYGPNICDGNFDTVAMLRGEMFVFKERWFWRVRNNQVMDGYPMPIGQFWRGLPASINTAYERKDGKFVFFKGDKHWVFDEASLEPGYPKHIKELGRGLPTDKIDAALFWMPNGKTYFFRGNKYYRFNEELRAVDSEYPKNIKVWEGIPESPRGSFMGSDEVFTYFYKGNKYWKFNNQKLKVEPGYPKSALRDWMGCPSGGRPDEGTEEETEVIIIEVDEEGGGAVSAAAVVLPVLLLLLVLAVGLAVFFFRRHGTPRRLLYCQRSLLDKV	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P50281			7.5	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
16233516	A novel lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens HU380: gene cloning, overproduction, renaturation-activation, two-step purification, and characterization.	The extracellular lipase gene (lipA) from Pseudomonas fluorescens HU380 was cloned from a genomic library constructed in pBluescript SK+. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1854 by encoding the lipase. Its deduced amino acid sequence included internal amino acid sequences of the lipase from this strain: The lipase showed significant sequence similarity to lipases of Serratia marcescens strains and P. fluorescens strains. In Escherichia coli, lipA was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies, which were subsequently solubilized by urea followed by dialysis. The refolded protein was soluble and biologically active. The lipase purified from the E. coli transformant by this denaturation-renaturation procedure followed by only two steps of column chromatographs exhibited the same electrophoretic mobility as did the enzyme purified from P. fluorescens HU380, and both enzymes were quite similar in physicochemical properties such as specific activity, suggesting that the recombinant lipase protein has an intrinsic folding capability in vitro. The function of its C-terminal region is also discussed.	2003 	Kojima Yuzo,Kobayashi Michihiko,Shimizu Sakayu	Journal of bioscience and bioengineering. 96(3) 242-9	Lipase	MGVYDYKNFGTADSKALFSDAMAITLYSYHNLDNGFAAGYQHNGFGLGLPATLVTALLGGTDSQGVIPGIPWNPDSEKLALEAVKKAGWTPITASQLGYDGKTDARGTFFGEKAGYSTAQVEILGKYDAQGHLTEIGIAFRGTSGPRENLILDSIGDVINDLLAAFGPKDYAKNYVGEAFGNLLNDVVAFAKANGLSGKDVLVSGHSLGGLAVNSMADLSGGKWGGFFADSNYIAYASPTQSSTDKVLNVGYENDPVFRALDGSNFTGASIGVHDAPKESATDNIVSFNDHYASTAWNLLPFSILNIPTWISHLPTAYGDGMNRVIESKFYDLTSKDSTIIVANLSDPARANTWVQDLNRNAETHKGSTFIIGSDANDLIQGGSGNDYLEGRAGNDTFRDSGGYNIILGGQGSNTLDLQKSVNTFDFANDGAGNLYIRDANGGISITRDIGAIVTKEPGFLWGLFKDDVTHSVTASGLKVGNNLTAYESSVKGSNGADTLKAHAGGDWLFGLDGNDHLIGGAGNDVFVGGAGNDLMESGGGADTFLFNGAFGQDRVVGFTSNDKLVFLGVQGVLPGDDFRAHASAAGQDTVLKFGGDSVTLVGVSLGSLSGDGIVIA	N-terminal methionine	Q76D31			7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15950181	Identification of the human DEAD-box protein p68 as a substrate of Tlk1.	The activity of the human protein kinase Tlk1 is down-regulated within minutes after exposure of cells to ionizing radiation. In order to identify signaling pathways which might be relevant in the radiation response of mammalian cells we screened nuclear proteins for substrates of Tlk1. Among several proteins one could be identified as p68 RNA helicase. Furthermore, it could be shown that Tlk1 phosphorylates immunoprecipitated p68. The phosphorylation of the C-terminal fragment of p68 by rTlk1 reduced its affinity to single stranded RNA in a gel shift assay. In addition, it could be demonstrated that increasing the Tlk1 activity in HT1080 cells by forced Tlk1 overexpression leads to an increased phosphorylation of endogenous p68, arguing that p68 might be a physiological substrate of Tlk1. These findings open the possibility that Tlk1 might participate in diverse biologic functions like cell growth and differentiation, pre-mRNA splicing, and transcriptional coactivation.	2005 Jul	Kodym Reinhard,Henöckl Christian,Fürweger Christoph	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 333(2) 411-7	Tousled-like kinase 1 also known as Serine/threonine-protein kinase tousled-like	MSVQSSSGSLEGPPSWSQLSTSPTPGSAAAARSLLNHTPPSGRPREGAMDELHSLDPRRQELLEARFTGVASGSTGSTGSCSVGAKASTNNESSNHSFGSLGSLSDKESETPEKKQSESSRGRKRKAENQNESSQGKSIGGRGHKISDYFEYQGGNGSSPVRGIPPAIRSPQNSHSHSTPSSSVRPNSPSPTALAFGDHPIVQPKQLSFKIIQTDLTMLKLAALESNKIQDLEKKEGRIDDLLRANCDLRRQIDEQQKLLEKYKERLNKCISMSKKLLIEKSTQEKLSSREKSMQDRLRLGHFTTVRHGASFTEQWTDGFAFQNLVKQQEWVNQQREDIERQRKLLAKRKPPTANNSQAPSTNSEPKQRKNKAVNGAENDPFVRPNLPQLLTLAEYHEQEEIFKLRLGHLKKEEAEIQAELERLERVRNLHIRELKRINNEDNSQFKDHPTLNERYLLLHLLGRGGFSEVYKAFDLYEQRYAAVKIHQLNKSWRDEKKENYHKHACREYRIHKELDHPRIVKLYDYFSLDTDTFCTVLEYCEGNDLDFYLKQHKLMSEKEARSIVMQIVNALRYLNEIKPPIIHYDLKPGNILLVDGTACGEIKITDFGLSKIMDDDSYGVDGMDLTSQGAGTYWYLPPECFVVGKEPPKISNKVDVWSVGVIFFQCLYGRKPFGHNQSQQDILQENTILKATEVQFPVKPVVSSEAKAFIRRCLAYRKEDRFDVHQLANDPYLLPHMRRSNSSGNLHMAGLTASPTPPSSSIITY	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9UKI8			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16165152	Crystallographic studies on decameric Brucella spp. Lumazine synthase: a novel quaternary arrangement evolved for a new function?	The enzyme lumazine synthase (LS) catalyzes the penultimate step of riboflavin biosynthesis in plants, fungi and bacteria. The quaternary structure of the polypeptide differs between species, existing as pentamers or as icosahedrally arranged dodecamers of pentamers with 60 subunits. The pathogen Brucella spp. expresses two proteins that exhibit LS activity, RibH1 and RibH2. The latter enzyme belongs to a novel third category of quaternary arrangement for LS, that of a decameric structure assembled as a head-to-head oriented dimer of pentamers. In contrast, the RibH1 enzyme is assembled as a pentamer, as noted for several other LS enzymes. RibH1 appears to be the functional LS in Brucella spp., whereas RibH2, an enzyme of lower catalytic activity, is a virulence factor presumably acting in response to oxidative stress. The latter observation prompted us to further investigate the structural and catalytic properties of RibH2 in order to clarify the biological function of this enzyme. Here, we present a detailed analysis of two new crystallographic forms of RibH2 that explain the low catalytic activity of this enzyme in comparison with RibH1 and other LSs. Additionally, we analyze the effect of pH on the structure of this enzyme, and the binding of riboflavin and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine to its active site.	2005 Oct	Klinke Sebastián,Zylberman Vanesa,Vega Daniel R,Guimarães Beatriz G,Braden Bradford C,Goldbaum Fernando A	Journal of molecular biology. 353(1) 124-37	Riboflavin synthase 2 beta chain	MNQSCPNKTSFKIAFIQARWHADIVDEARKSFVAELAAKTGGSVEVEIFDVPGAYEIPLHAKTLARTGRYAAIVGAAFVIDGGIYRHDFVATAVINGMMQVQLETEVPVLSVVLTPHHFHESKEHHDFFHAHFKVKGVEAAHAALQIVSERSRIAALV		P61711				0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8260495	Preparation of active recombinant TIMP-1 from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies and complex formation with the recombinant catalytic domain of PMNL-collagenase.	TIMP-1 is a member of the family of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases involved in regulating the activity of extracellular matrix degrading metalloproteinases. The TIMP-1 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of the corresponding mRNA from human fibroblasts. Cloning and expression of the TIMP-1 cDNA were performed in Escherichia coli. In the host vector system chosen, rTIMP-1 is stored intracellularly in its denatured, insoluble form in inclusion bodies. We report a new method for the purification and renaturation of rTIMP-1 from E. coli inclusion bodies to an active inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (80% yield), presumably containing the correct assignment of the six disulfide bonds. A resin with the covalently bound recombinant catalytic domain of the PMNL-collagenase as the affinity ligand provided an effective means for the separation of correctly folded, active rTIMP-1 from inactive forms with mismatched disulfides. TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, the two most extensively examined members of the family of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, are known to form a complex with the activated forms of most matrix metalloproteinases and the latent forms of the 92-kDa and 72-kDa gelatinases, respectively. In this study, we report on the complex formation of the recombinant catalytic domain of the PMNL-collagenase with TIMP-1, nonglycosylated recombinant TIMP-1, and recombinant TIMP-2. The Ki values for the different inhibitors were determined in a kinetic assay using a fluorogenic substrate peptide. In this assay, rTIMP-2 had a more effective inhibitory capability against the recombinant catalytic domain of the PMNL-collagenase than TIMP-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1993 Dec	Kleine T,Bartsch S,Bläser J,Schnierer S,Triebel S,Valentin M,Gote T,Tschesche H	Biochemistry. 32(51) 14125-31	Metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 also known as Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinas	CTCVPPHPQTAFCNSDLVIRAKFVGTPEVNQTTLYQRYEIKMTKMYKGFQALGDAADIRFVYTPAMESVCGYFHRSHNRSEEFLIAGKLQDGLLHITTCSFVAPWNSLSLAQRRGFTKTYTVGCEECTVFPCLSIPCKLQSGTHCLWTDQLLQGSEKGFQSRHLACLPREPGLCTWQSLRSQIA		P01033			8.7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
7696877	Reconstitution of Arabidopsis casein kinase II from recombinant subunits and phosphorylation of transcription factor GBF1.	In contrast to the well-defined tetrameric structure of animal and yeast casein kinase II (CKII), plant CKII is found in two forms: a monomeric form and an oligomeric form whose subunit composition is not well defined. The Arabidopsis homologs of the catalytic subunit alpha (CKA1) and the regulatory subunit beta (CKB1) of CKII were expressed in Escherichia coli to examine their ability to form complexes, the effect of CKB1 on the catalytic activity, and the relationship of the recombinant enzymes to those isolated from plant material. Both subunits were found mainly in the inclusion body fraction in the bacterial expression strains, and they were solubilized and renatured with the recovery of catalytic (CKA1) and stimulatory (CKB1) activities. The combination of purified CKA1 and CKB1 proteins resulted in up to 100-fold stimulation of casein kinase activity compared with the CKA1 activity alone, showing that CKB1 has biochemical properties similar to those of the beta subunit from animals. CKA1 and CKB1 spontaneously assembled into a tetrameric complex, CKA1(2)CKB12, which had properties very similar to those of the oligomeric CKII form isolated from broccoli. However, the properties of the catalytic subunit CKA1 alone differed from those of the broccoli monomeric form of CKII-like activity. Phosphorylation of transcription factor GBF1 with the reconstituted CKA1(2)CKB1(2) enzyme resulted in stimulation of its DNA binding activity and retardation of the protein-DNA complex; these results are identical to those obtained previously with isolated nuclear CKII from broccoli.	1995 Jan	Klimczak L J,Collinge M A,Farini D,Giuliano G,Walker J C,Cashmore A R	The Plant cell. 7(1) 105-15	Casein kinase II subunit alpha-1-subunit beta-1	MSKARVYTEVNVIRPKDYWDYESLIVQWGEQDDYEVVRKVGRGKYSEVFEGINVNSKEKCIIKILKPVKKKKIRREIKILQNLCGGPNIVKLLDVVRDQHSKTPSLIFEYVNSTDFKVLYPTLTDYDIRYYIYELLKALDFCHSQGIMHRDVKPHNVMIDHELRKLRLIDWGLAEFYHPGKEYNVRVASRYFKGPELLVDLQDYDYSLDMWSLGCMFAGMIFRKEPFFYGHDNQDQLVKIAKVLGTDELNAYLNKYQLELDPQLEALVGRHSRKPWSKFINADNQHLVSPEAIDFLDKLLRYDHQDRLTAKEAMAHAYFAQVRAAETSRMRSQMYRDRGTVNSRPEVVDRKRINDALERPSPSTSRQVNGKGKGTVTAATTTANLIGKQQSNNINHRDSRSASLSKNNTVSDDESDTDSEESDVSGSDGEDTSWISWFCNLRGNEFFCEVDDDYIQDDFNLCGLSSLVPYYEYALDLILDVESSQGEMFTEEQNELIESAAEMLYGLIHARYILTSKGLAAMLDKYKNYDFGRCPRVYCCGQPCLPVGQSDLPRSSTVKIYCPKCEDIYYPRSKYQGNIDGAYFGTTFPHLFLMTYGHLKPAKATQNYVQRVFGFKLHKP					8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
9557874	Expression, purification, and biochemical characterization of a recombinant lectin of Sarcocystis muris (Apicomplexa) cyst merozoites.	The mature major microneme protein of Sarcocystis muris cyst merozoites, which is known as a dimeric lectin with high affinity to galactose and some of its derivatives, was expressed in Escherichia colias a histidine-tagged fusion protein. The recombinant polypeptide, which was recognized by a monoclonal antibody directed against the native lectin, was purified from inclusion bodies after solubilization and refolding, using a combination of metal chelate and lactose affinity chromatography. The apparent molecular mass of the refolded polypeptide as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoreses was 16 kDa, whereas gel filtration chromatography clearly demonstrated that the recombinant protein, like its native counterpart, exists as a homodimer of two non-covalently associated subunits. Inhibition of haemagglutination suggests that the combining site of the recombinant lectin recognizes N-acetyl-galactosamine as the dominant sugar, thus confirming the correct folding of the monosaccharide combining site in the renatured lectin. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first reported detailed characterization of a recombinant lectin from apicomplexan parasites, and may contribute to a better understanding of the process of host cell recognition and invasion by these obligate intracellular protozoa.	1998 Feb	Klein H,Löschner B,Zyto N,Pörtner M,Montag T	Glycoconjugate journal. 15(2) 147-53	Microneme protein SML2 [Fragment]	AGPQLDVSCFAHDKNIGSRTEQLSVVHVASAQDCMKECQALPTCSHFTYNKNSKKCHLKAGAPEFYTYTGDMTGPRSCEHNCSDACWMDGNNPLAVWDYSGQPPALCWAACMGTPGCDLYTFQGMTCKLYSQTSSKRA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q549G0				30	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16018966	Protein kinase B from Giardia intestinalis.	A novel serine/threonine protein kinase from Giardia intestinalis (GiPKB) was isolated by a combination of PCR techniques. Analysis of the GiPKB sequence indicated that the encoded protein appears to be a member of a novel subgroup of serine/threonine protein kinases known as protein kinase B. Reverse transcription PCR and Northern hybridization showed that the transcription of GiPKB is developmentally regulated. The GiPKB was expressed as a recombinant protein, which was characterized and shown to have a protein kinase activity. The preferred substrate for the GiPKB was histone H1, while histone H2A, GSK3 peptide, GS peptide, and Kemptide were phosphorylated at about 96, 73, 51, and 400f the activity with histone H1, respectively. Neither cAMP, Ca(2+), nor Ca(2+)/calmodulin stimulated the enzyme activity. The GiPKB utilized ATP rather than GTP as a phosphate donor with an apparent K(m) of 20 microM. The identification and characterization of this differentially and constitutively expressed GiPKB should allow further analysis of the regulation and signal transduction pathways in Giardia.	2005 Aug	Kim Kyu-Tae,Mok Myth T S,Edwards Michael R	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 334(2) 333-41	Serine/threonine protein kinase PKB	MSDTDVRIKYAVTKTSSRGKKQPRSLVLTSKSVQNVMGNSIQWERPVQEIYGIHRSTKEPKAFVISFLQTYRFDVESADQVSSIVSAFQRLNLGEVFVDDKIGAYGLQTDKGKGYKKGHVNVSSDEDGDIGATGAVSQAADAPASSGQKDRPRTTILEDDLDENIEYVEDTRVLAHQIETLPETEVLETFCNPVAAYKFVRPPIFPQVPPSHAKVMRPQNFELVSVVGKGSFGKVFLVRRVEDNRFFAMKVLKKRNVLDRRQLEHLKAEHNILQSFNHPNMIKLYHSFQTRTRLFLVTTFATGGELFYHLKKIGRFPEPLAVFYLAQIVLVIEYLHKHDIVFRDMKPENLLLDNHGNILLTDFGLSKTGISADNSGGAGVCSGSFCGTPDYLSGEIISGVPHGKMVDIWALGALLFEMLVGSAPFSYASSTSTHGGNARSELYRRILKNIIVFPVFISAECKSFIAKCLSRRPKDRPNFDEIKKHEVFRKNKIDFDKLYRKEIQPPFKPKLEQSCILAVDGKLLKNPLDNIYRYIAPEALVVNFDAKFTSESPILPPSTQTDSVTMQEDKNFKDFAWTAQDAFDKL		Q9U020			7.4	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12914782	Inhibition of apoptosis by recombinant 30K protein originating from silkworm hemolymph.	In a previous study, we reported that silkworm hemolymph inhibits apoptosis and that the anti-apoptotic component in silkworm hemolymph is a 30K protein. In this study, the 30K protein encoded by 30Kc6 was expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant 30K protein was expressed as an inclusion body, and the inclusion body was separated and refolded by affinity column chromatography using a 6xHis tag. We demonstrated that apoptosis is inhibited by supplementing the culture medium with this purified recombinant 30K protein. The recombinant 30K protein inhibited the virus- or chemical-induced apoptosis in human cells as well as insect cells. Apoptosis-inhibitory activity of recombinant 30K protein was comparable to that of whole silkworm hemolymph. The recombinant 30K protein can be effectively used to minimize cell death and consequently increase the productivity by extending the production time of host cells in commercial animal cell culture.	2003 Aug	Kim Eun Jeong,Park Hye Jung,Park Tai Hyun	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 308(3) 523-8	30K protein	MRLTLFAFVLAVCALASNATLAPRTDDVLAEQLYMSVVIGEYETAIAKCSEYLKEKKGEVIKEAVKRLIENGKRNTMDFAYQLWTKDGKEIVKSYFPIQFRVIFTEQTVKLINKRDHHALKLIDQQNHNKIAFGGSKDKTSKKVSWKFTPVLENNRVYFKIMSTEDKQYLKLDNTKGSSDDRIIYGDSTADTFKHQWYLEPSMYESDVMFFVYNREYNSVMTLDEDMAANEDREALGHSGEVSGYPQLFAWYIVPY	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q17185				0	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15596368	Purification, refolding, and characterization of recombinant Pseudomonas fluorescens lipase.	Thermostable Pseudomonas fluorescens SIK W1 lipase (PFL), which is responsible for the spoilage of milk, was overexpressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Renaturation of solubilized PFL was achieved by using size-exclusion protein refolding chromatography. The renatured enzyme was purified homogeneously using a combination of gel filtration and ion-exchange FPLC. Its specific activity was found to be enhanced in the presence of Ca2+. Secondary structural changes induced by Ca2+ were monitored by circular dichroism, which demonstrated that the activity increase of PFL in the presence of Ca2+ is strongly correlated with significant increases in alpha-helix and beta-sheet content. In the presence of Ca2+, the PFL structure was found resistant to denaturation by guanidine hydrochloride and to enzyme activity loss due to cosolvents like DMSO and trifluoroethanol, suggesting that Ca2+ plays an important role in inducing conformational changes and consequently in maintaining enzyme structural stability.	2005 Jan	Kim Kyu Rae,Kwon Dae Young,Yoon Suk Hoo,Kim Woo Yeon,Kim Kyung Hyun	Protein expression and purification. 39(1) 124-9	Lipase	MSQELATRYPLVLVPGMLGFVRLLLYPYWYGIIPALRRGGAQVIAVQVSPLNSSEVRGEQLLAQIQRIMAETGAARVNLIGHSQGALTARYAAARRPDWVASVTSVAGPNHGSELADYLQRHSPAHSLRGRVLSLLLRGISSLMRLLETGYRGPKQPVDIHASHQSLTTEGVALFNRQYPQGLPQEWGGQGPAQVDGVHYYSWSGILQPGKTNRGRNLFDGTNRSCRLFARTFVREAGQCDGMVGRYSSHLGQVIGDDYPLDHFDIVNQSLGLVGKGAEPIRLFVEHARRLKAAGL		Q4KJ24			8	4	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12297031	In vitro determination of dengue virus type 2 NS2B-NS3 protease activity with fluorescent peptide substrates.	The NS2B-NS3(pro) polyprotein segment from the dengue virus serotype 2 strain 16681 was purified from overexpressing E. coli by metal chelate affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Enzymatic activity of the refolded NS2B-NS3(pro) protease complex was determined in vitro with dansyl-labeled peptide substrates, based upon native dengue virus type 2 cleavage sites. The 12mer substrate peptides and the cleavage products could be separated by reversed-phase HPLC, and were identified by UV and fluorescence detection. All of the peptide substrates (representing the DEN polyprotein junction sequences at the NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A and NS4B/NS5 sites) were cleaved by the recombinant protease NS2B-NS3(pro). No cleavage was observed with an enzymatically inactive S135A mutant of the NS3 protein, or with a modified substrate peptide of the NS3/NS4A polyprotein site that contained a K2093A substitution. Enzymatic activity was dependent on the salt concentration. A 50 0ecrease of activity was observed in the presence of 0.1 M sodium chloride. Our results show that the NS3 protease activity of the refolded NS2BNS3(pro) protein can be assayed in vitro with high specificity by using cleavage-junction derived peptide substrates.	2002 Mar	Khumthong Rabuesak,Angsuthanasombat Chanan,Panyim Sakol,Katzenmeier Gerd	Journal of biochemistry and molecular biology. 35(2) 206-12	NS2B-NS3 Protease	SWPLNEAIMAVGMVSILASSLLKNDIPMTGPLVAGGPLTVCYVLTGRSADLELERAADVKWEDQAEISGSSPILSITISEDGSMSIKNEEEEQTLTILIRTGLLVISGLFPVSIPITAAAWYLWEVKKQRAGVLWDVPSPPPMGKAELEDGAYRIKQKGILGYSQIGAGVYKEGTFHTMWHVTRGAVLMHKGKRIEPSWADVKKDLISYGGGWKLEGEWKEGEEVQVLALEPGKNPRAVQTKPGLFKTNAGTIGAVSLDFSPGTSGSPIIDKKGKVVGLYGNGVVTRSGAYVSAIAQTEKSIEDNPEIEDDIFRKRRLTIMDLHPGAGKTKRYLPAIVREAIKRGLRTLILAPTRVVAAEMEEALRGLPIRYQTPAIRAEHTGREIVDLMCHATFTMRLLSPVRVPNYNLIIMDEAHFTDPASIAARGYISTRVEMGEAAGIFMTATPPGSRDPFPQSNAPIIDEEREIPERSWNSGHEWVTDFKGKTVWFVPSIKAGNDIAACLSKNGKKVIQLSRKTFDSEYAKTRTNDWDFVVTTDISEMGANFKAERVIDPRRCMKPVILTDGEERVILAGPMPVTHSSAAQRRGRIGRNPKNENDQYIYMGEPLENDEDCAHWKEAKMLLDNINTPEGIIPSMFEPEREKVDAIDGEYRLRGEARTTFVDLMRRGDLPVWLAYRVAAEGINYADRRWCFDGVKNNQILEENVEVEIWTKEGERKKLKPRWLDARIYSDPLALKEFKEFAAGRK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P29990			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
15907844	Co-refolding of two peptide fragments derived from Agrobacterium tumefaciens beta-glucosidase with catalytic activity.	Four sites of the non-homologous region (coding amino acid residues of 347, 421, 466 and 533) of a gene were randomly selected for splitting to investigate the function of beta-glucosidase from Agrobacterium tumefaciens in the co-refolding of peptides into the catalytically active enzyme. As a result of gene splitting, four N- and C-terminal domain peptides were obtained as insoluble inclusion bodies. No catalytic activity was observed when these fragments refolded individually. However, a considerable amount of activity was restored when the two fragments derived from N- and C- terminal peptides were co-refolded together. The deletion of amino acid residues in the non-homologous region resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity, which suggests that truncation of amino acids in this region strongly affects the co-refolding ability of the enzyme to maintain activity.	2005 Jun	Kim Bong-Jo,Mangala Selanere L,Hayashi Kiyoshi	FEBS letters. 579(14) 3075-80	Beta-glucosidase	MIDDILDKMTLEEQVSLLSGADFWTTVAIERLGVPKIKVTDGPNGARGGGSLVGGVKSACFPVAIALGATWDPELIERAGVALGGQAKSKGASVLLAPTVNIHRSGLNGRNFECYSEDPALTAACAVAYINGVQSQGVAATIKHFVANESEIERQTMSSDVDERTLREIYLPPFEEAVKKAGVKAVMSSYNKLNGTYTSENPWLLTKVLREEWGFDGVVMSDWFGSHSTAETINAGLDLEMPGPWRDRGEKLVAAVREGKVKAETVRASARRILLLLERVGAFEKAPDLAEHALDLPEDRALIRQLGAEGAVLLKNDGVLPLAKSSFDQIAVIGPNAASARVMGGGSARIAAHYTVSPLEGIRAALSNANSLRHAVGCNNNRLIDVFSGEMTVEYFKGRGFESRPVHVETVEKGEFFWFDLPSGDLDLADFSARMTATFVPQETGEHIFGMTNAGLARLFVDGELVVDGYDGWTKGENFFGTANSEQRRAVTLGAARRYRVVVEYEAPKASLDGINICALRFGVEKPLGDAGIAEAVETARKSDIVLLLVGREGEWDTEGLDLPDMRLPGRQEELIEAVAETNPNVVVVLQTGGPIEMPWLGKVRAVLQMWYPGQELGNALADVLFGDVEPAGRLPQTFPKALTDNSAITDDPSIYPGQDGHVRYAEGIFVGYRHHDTREIEPLFPFGFGLGYTRFTWGAPQLSGTEMGADGLTVTVDVTNIGDRAGSDVVQLYVHSPNARVERPFKELRAFAKLKLAPGATGTAVLKIAPRDLAYFDVEAGRFRADAGKYELIVAASAIDIRASVSIHLPVDHVMEP	N-terminal +C terminal hexahistidine tag	P27034			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15375127	Insecticidal pilin subunit from the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila.	Xenorhabdus nematophila is an insect pathogen and produces protein toxins which kill the larval host. Previously, we characterized an orally toxic, large, outer membrane-associated protein complex from the culture medium of X. nematophila. Here, we describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of a 17-kDa pilin subunit of X. nematophila isolated from that protein complex. The gene was amplified by PCR, cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was refolded in vitro in the absence of its cognate chaperone by using a urea gradient. The protein oligomerized during in vitro refolding, forming multimers. Point mutations in the conserved N-terminal residues of the pilin protein greatly destabilized its oligomeric organization, demonstrating the importance of the N terminus in refolding and oligomerization of the pilin subunit by donor strand complementation. The recombinant protein was cytotoxic to cultured Helicoverpa armigera larval hemocytes, causing agglutination and subsequent release of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. The agglutination of larval cells by the 17-kDa protein was inhibited by several sugar derivatives. The biological activity of the purified recombinant protein indicated that it has a conformation similar to that of the native protein. The 17-kDa pilin subunit was found to be orally toxic to fourth- or fifth-instar larvae of an important crop pest, H. armigera, causing extensive damage to the midgut epithelial membrane. To our knowledge, this is first report describing an insecticidal pilin subunit of a bacterium.	2004 Oct	Khandelwal Puneet,Choudhury Devapriya,Birah Ajanta,Reddy M K,Gupta Gorakh Prasad,Banerjee Nirupama	Journal of bacteriology. 186(19) 6465-76	Fimbrial subunit also known as pilin subunit	MKLNTIGDGFRFWCGFNPGAANAAPTQGDGAVKFTGSIINAACSIKNNNIEVNMGQINNVVLKDGGESKPEHFKIELKDCVLDTLKGVKTMFTGPEAEGTMPGLLALDGGAQGAAIMITNHGNKHIPLGQASDMMTLHDGSKDLNFSARLKGLKGTEGKDISVKTGEFTAIANFTLNYL	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8GE68			8	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
12127966	Role of cis prolines 112 and 126 in the functional activity of ribonucleolytic toxin restrictocin.	Restrictocin is a 149 amino acid ribonucleolytic toxin produced by the fungus Aspergillus, which specifically cleaves a single phosphodiester bond within 28S rRNA resulting in a potent inhibition of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Restrictocin has 12 prolines out of which three at positions 48, 112, and 126 are cis. Prolines at position 112, 118, and 126 were individually mutated to alanine to investigate their role in the catalytic and membrane interaction activity of restrictocin. All mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, and recombinant proteins purified to homogeneity. Mutation of P112 resulted in a remarkable 50- and 100-fold reduction, respectively, in the ribonucleolytic and cytotoxic activities of restrictocin, whereas the interaction of P112A with phospholipid membranes increased. Mutants P118A and P126A exhibited 3-5-fold decreased ribonucleolytic and cytotoxic activities, however, their membrane interaction activity was marginally reduced compared to restrictocin. The study demonstrates that P112 is absolutely essential to maintain the functionally active conformation of restrictocin. Also, prolines 112, 118, and 126 do not appear to be directly involved in the membrane interaction activity of restrictocin.	2002 Jul	Goyal Anita,Seth Divya,Batra Janendra K	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 295(4) 812-7	Ribonuclease mitogillin also known as  Restrictocin	ATWTCINQQLNPKTNKWEDKRLLYSQAKAESNSHHAPLSDGKTGSSYPHWFTNGYDGNGKLIKGRTPIKFGKADCDRPPKHSQNGMGKDDHYLLEFPTFPDGHDYKFDSKKPKEDPGPARVIYTYPNKVFCGIVAHQRGNQGDLRLCSH	T7	P67876				0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12967710	Trypanosoma cruzi poly-zinc finger protein: a novel DNA/RNA-binding CCHC-zinc finger protein.	A poly-zinc finger protein, designated PZFP1 was identified in Trypanosoma cruzi for the first time. The protein has 191 amino acids, contains seven motifs Cys(X)(2)Cys(X)(4)His(X)(4)Cys. A recombinant PZFP1 was generated in E. coli and the expected 21kDa polypeptide co-purified with two other inducible products of about 42 and 63kDa. Western blot analysis of cell extracts using an anti-PZFP1 antibody recognized a major band of 41kDa. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis demonstrated that both, recombinant and native PZFP1, specifically interact with single-stranded DNA or RNA oligonucleotides carrying recognition sequences of other CCHC proteins. The protein was localized mainly in the cytoplasm and nucleus as observed by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. PZFP1 interacted specifically with a T. cruzi serine-arginine-rich protein (TcSR) in a yeast two-hybrid assay, suggesting a role in pre-mRNA processing.	2003 Sep	Espinosa Joaquín M,Portal Daniel,Lobo Guillermo S,Pereira Claudio A,Alonso Guillermo D,Gómez Eliana B,Lan Graciela Humbert,Pomar Rolando V Rivera,Flawiá Mirtha M,Torres Héctor N	Molecular and biochemical parasitology. 131(1) 35-44	Poly-zinc finger protein 1	MAEEIPMNKRPRIEGGGSTCHRCGETGHFARECPNIPPGAMGDRACYNCGQPGHLSRGCPTRPPGAMGGRACYNCGQPGHPSRECPTRPPGAMGGRACYNCGQPGHLSRECPTRPPGTMGDRACYKCGRMGHLSRECPNRPAGGFRGVARGACYHCQQEGHLARDCPNAPPGGERACYNCGQTGHTSRACPVK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	O77233			7.7	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
8615834	Expression in Escherichia coli, purification and characterization of heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum.	The use of heparin for extracorporeal therapies has been problematical due to haemorrhagic complications; as a consequence, heparinase I from Flavobacterium heparinum is used for the determination of plasma heparin and for elimination of heparin from circulation. Here we report the expression of recombinant heparinase I in Escherichia coli, purification to homogeneity and characterization of the purified enzyme. Heparinase I was expressed with an N-terminal histidine tag. The enzyme was insoluble and inactive, but could be refolded, and was purified to homogeneity by nickel-chelate chromatography. The cumulative yield was 43%, and the recovery of purified heparinase I was 14.4 mg/l of culture. The N-terminal sequence and the molecular mass as analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption MS were consistent with predictions from the heparinase I gene structure. The reverse-phase HPLC profile of the tryptic digest, the Michaelis-Menten constant Km (47 micrograms/ml) and the specific activity (117 units/mg) of purified recombinant heparinase I were similar to those of the native enzyme. Degradation of heparin by heparinase I results in a characteristic product distribution, which is different from those obtained by degradation with heparinase II or III from F. heparinum. We developed a rapid anion-exchange HPLC method to separate the products of enzymic heparin degradation, using POROS perfusion chromatography media. Separation of characteristic di-, tetra- and hexa-saccharide products is performed in 10 min. These methods for the expression, purification and analysis of recombinant heparinase I may facilitate further development of heparinase I-based medical therapies as well as further investigation of the structures of heparin and heparan sulphate and their role in the extracellular matrix.	1996 Apr	Ernst S,Venkataraman G,Winkler S,Godavarti R,Langer R,Cooney C L,Sasisekharan R	The Biochemical journal. 315 ( Pt 2) 589-97	Heparinase I also known as Heparin lyase I	QQKKSGNIPYRVNVQADSAKQKAIIDNKWVAVGINKPYALQYDDKLRFNGKPSYRFELKAEDNSLEGYAAGETKGRTELSYSYATTNDFKKFPPSVYQNAQKLKTVYHYGKGICEQGSSRSYTFSVYIPSSFPDNATTIFAQWHGAPSRTLVATPEGEIKTLSIEEFLALYDRMIFKKNIAHDKVEKKDKDGKITYVAGKPNGWKVEQGGYPTLAFGFSKGYFYIKANSDRQWLTDKADRNNANPENSEVMKPYSSEYKTSTIAYKMPFAQFPKDCWITFDVAIDWTKYGKEANTILKPGKLDVMMTYTKNKKPQKAHIVNQQEILIGRNDDDGYYFKFGIYRVGNSTVPVTYNLSGYSETAR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q05819			7.9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

16321978	Identification of constitutive phosphorylation sites on the Epstein-Barr virus ZEBRA protein.	ZEBRA, the product of the Epstein-Barr virus gene bzlf1, and a member of the AP-1 subfamily of basic zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, is necessary and sufficient to disrupt viral latency and to initiate the viral lytic cycle. Two serine residues of ZEBRA, Ser167 and Ser173, are substrates for casein kinase 2 (CK2) and are constitutively phosphorylated in vivo. Phosphorylation of ZEBRA at its CK2 sites is required for proper temporal regulation of viral gene expression. Phosphopeptide analysis indicated that ZEBRA contains additional constitutive phosphorylation sites. Here we employed a co-migration strategy to map these sites in vivo. The cornerstone of this strategy was to correlate the migration of 32P- and 35S-labeled tryptic peptides of ZEBRA. The identity of the peptides was revealed by mutagenesis of methionine and cysteine residues present in each peptide. Phosphorylation sites within the peptide were identified by mutagenesis of serines and threonines. ZEBRA was shown to be phosphorylated at serine and threonine residues, but not tyrosine. Two previously unrecognized phosphorylation sites of ZEBRA were identified in the NH2-terminal region of the transactivation domain: a cluster of weak phosphorylation sites at Ser6, Thr7, and Ser8 and a strong phosphorylation site at Thr14. Thr14 was embedded in a MAP kinase consensus sequence and could be phosphorylated in vitro by JNK, despite the absence of a canonical JNK docking site. Thus ZEBRA is now known to be constitutively phosphorylated at three distinct sites.	2006 Feb	El-Guindy Ayman S,Paek So Yeon,Countryman Jill,Miller George	The Journal of biological chemistry. 281(6) 3085-95	ZEBRA protein also known as Z protein	MMDPNSTSEDVKFTPDPYQVPFVQAFDQATRVYQDLGGPSQAPLPCVLWPVLPEPLPQGQLTAYHVSAAPTGSWFPAPQPAPENAYQAYAAPQLFPVSDITQNQLTNQAGGEAPQPGDNSTVQPAAAVVLACPGANQEQQLADIGAPQPAPAAAPARRTRKPLQPESLEECDSELEIKRYKNRVASRKCRAKFKHLLQHYREVASAKSSENDRLRLLLKQMCPSLDVDSIIPRTPDVLHEDLLNF		Q3KSS8				0	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16289409	Japanese encephalitis virus NS2B-NS3 protease binding to phage-displayed human brain proteins with the domain of trypsin inhibitor and basic region leucine zipper.	Flavivirus NS2B-NS3 proteases are associated with neurovirulence, becoming an important target for insight into the virus-induced pathogenesis. In this study, a phage-displayed human brain cDNA library was used to detect possible interaction between brain proteins and the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS2B-NS3 protease. After six rounds of biopanning, eight high-affinity NS2B-NS3 protease-interacting phages were identified. Identified NS2B-NS3 protease-interacting brain proteins contained several repeats of the consensus motifs E(R/K)(R/K)K and G(R/K)(R/K) with the dibasic residues, being similar to the conserved cleavage sites among flavivirus proteases. In addition, three identified brain proteins (phage-24, 34, and 44) were predicted as the domain of trypsin inhibitor and basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) using the SMART genome search. Immunoprecipitation and cleavage of two brain fusion proteins (phage-24 and phage-46) by the NS2B-NS3 protease confirmed the specific interaction between identified brain proteins and the JEV NS2B-NS3 protease. Fluorogenic peptide substrate assays revealed dose-manner inhibitory effects of these two brain fusion proteins on the trans-cleavage activity of NS2B-NS3 protease. Moreover, in vitro signaling pathway assay revealed that the JEV NS2B-NS3 protease significantly inhibited the signaling pathway of activator protein 1(AP1), a member of the bZIP family. Our results provide an insight into the protein interaction network of the JEV NS2B-NS3 protease in human brain.	2006 Mar	Lin Cheng-Wen,Lin Kuan-Hsun,Lyu Ping-Chiang,Chen Wei-June	Virus research. 116(1-2) 106-13	NS2B-NS3 Protease	GWPATEFLSAVGLMFAIVGGLAELDIESMSIPFMLAGLMAVSYVVSGKATDMWLERAADISWEMDAAITGSSRRLDVKLDDDGDFHLIDDPGVPWKVWVLRMSCIGLAALTPWAIVPAAFGYWLTLKTTKRGGVFWDTPSPKPCSKGDTTTGVYRIMARGILGTYQAGVGVMYENVFHTLWHTTRGAAIMSGEGKLTPYWGSVKEDRIAYGGPWRFDRKWNGTDDVQVIVVEPGKAAVNIQTKPGVFRTPFGEVGAVSLDYPRGTSGSPILDSNGDIIGLYGNGVELGDGSYVSAIVQGDRQEEPVPEAYTPNMLRK		P32886				4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

Bovine conglutinin is a collagenous C-type lectin (collectin) that is found in bovine serum. A recombinant protein, composed of the neck-region and the carbohydrate binding domain of bovine conglutinin, has been overexpressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein has been successfully renatured and showed the same sugar binding specificity as the native protein and was able to bind to yeast mannan and complement-activated immune complexes. The binding was calcium-dependent and was inhibited by N-acetylglucosamine. The concentration of N-acetylglucosamine required for 50 0nhibition of binding to mannan was 1.77 mM for recombinant conglutinin and 0.71 mM for native conglutinin, respectively. The recombinant conglutinin should be useful in the assay and purification of circulating immune complexes and for therapeutic purposes involving the removal of immune complexes from patient&#39;s plasma.	1996 Jan	Lim B L,Holmskov U	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 218(1) 260-6	Conglutinin	AEMTTFSQKILANACTLVMCSPLESGLPGHDGQDGRECPHGEKGDPGSPGPAGRAGRPGWVGPIGPKGDNGFVGEPGPKGDTGPRGPPGMPGPAGREGPSGKQGSMGPPGTPGPKGETGPKGGVGAPGIQGFPGPSGLKGEKGAPGETGAPGRAGVTGPSGAIGPQGPSGARGPPGLKGDRGDPGETGAKGESGLAEVNALKQRVTILDGHLRRFQNAFSQYKKAVLFPDGQAVGEKIFKTAGAVKSYSDAEQLCREAKGQLASPRSSAENEAVTQMVRAQEKNAYLSMNDISTEGRFTYPTGEILVYSNWADGEPNNSDEGQPENCVEIFPDGKWNDVPCSKQLLVICEF	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P23805				4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15726567	The carboxyterminal processing protease of D1 protein: expression, purification and enzymology of the recombinant and native spinach proteins.	The carboxyterminal processing protease of D1 protein (CtpA) is predicted to be an excellent target for a general broad-spectrum herbicide. The gene for spinach CtpA has been expressed in Escherichia coli. The expressed protein that was found mainly in inclusion bodies has been purified and refolded on a nickel-chelate column. Active recombinant CtpA was recovered. Two assays for CtpA activity were developed, a medium-throughput HPLC assay using a fluorescent substrate and a high-throughput assay based on fluorescence polarization capable of application in a high-throughput 96-well plate format. This high-throughput assay was developed to screen chemistry for CtpA inhibitors. Native spinach CtpA was partially purified and the native and recombinant enzymes were compared kinetically for their K(m) and V(max) values using different peptide substrates. Native CtpA partially purified from spinach was shown to have similar kinetic properties to recombinant CtpA. Antibodies developed against the recombinant protein were used to estimate the in planta abundance of the native enzyme in spinach. Since only a small proportion of the recombinant protein is refolded during isolation and it appears that only a small proportion of this enzyme is active, size-exclusion chromatography and light scattering experiments were performed on rCtpA in order to gain insight into its structure and the reasons why most of the protein is not active. The use of rCtpA to screen for herbicidal compounds and the more general question of how good a herbicide target the enzyme is are discussed.	2005 Jul	Fabbri Bradon J,Duff Stephen M G,Remsen Edward E,Chen Yun-Chia Sophia,Anderson John C,CaJacob Claire A	Pest management science. 61(7) 682-90	C-terminal processing protease of the D1 protein	MEVISRLTFASVSYPFISSNLNPTPMLNSFNFRVLSWNSAPTNVAEAHLHRLLLRKLNPANDRVVGISNFGCSCRLDLWPSWRRHKRLFFQNGVSTIRWEVKKCSPKFYKIVSNYEKCKRHIYVPSVRLVVGVVLLMSVSVALNQDPSWSLSEENRIFLEAWRTIDRAYVDKTFNGQSWFRYRENALRNEPMNSREETYTAIRKMVATLNDPFTRFLEPEKLKSLRSGTQSSLTGVGISIGPTAVDQSSTGLVVISATPGAPASRAGILPGDVILAIDDASTDKMGIYEAANILQGPDGSSVDLTICSRDEIKHVVLKRERITLSPVKSRLCEMPGSAKDAPPKVGYIKLTTFTENASDAVKEAIETLRSNNVNAFVLDLRDNSGGLFPEGIEIAKIWLNKGVIVYICDSRGVRDIYDVEGSSAVAGSEPLVVLVNKGTASASEILAGALKDKKRAVVFGEPTYGKGKIQSVFELSDGSGLAVTVARYETPAHTDIGKVGIKPDHPLPASFPKDENDFCTCVQDPSSTCYLNGVQLFSR	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q36792			7.7	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15883018	Effects of single amino acid substitutions at the predicted coiled-coil or hydrophobic region on the self-assembly of phi29 replication protein, gp1.	Gp1, the product of one of the essential genes of phi29 replication, is an RNA binding protein and self-associates to form large complexes. Furthermore, gp1 suppresses the synthesis of phi29 DNA polymerase and primer protein in the post-transcriptional process. In this report, we have employed seven variants with single amino acid substitutions to analyze the self-assembly of gp1. Using chemical cross-linking and sedimentation assays, amino acid substitutions within the predicted coiled-coil or hydrophobic region were shown to strongly affect the formation of large complexes, suggesting that these two regions were required for the self-assembly of gp1. The self-association of gp1 was suggested to be necessary for the efficient binding to RNA and the translational repression.	2005 Jun	Hashiyama Kazuya,Takeuchi Ari,Makino Osamu	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 331(4) 1310-6	Protein p1	MGKIFDQEKRLEGTWKNSKWGNQGIIAPVDGDLKMIDLELEKKMTKLEHENKLMKNALYELSRMENNDYATWVIKVLFGGAPHGAK	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q6LDQ1			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10913300	The N-terminal fragment of human parathyroid hormone receptor 1 constitutes a hormone binding domain and reveals a distinct disulfide pattern.	The N-terminal extracellular parts of human G-protein coupled receptor class B, for example, receptors for secretin, glucagon, or parathyroid hormone, are involved in ligand binding. To obtain structural and functional information on the N-terminal receptor fragment of human parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (PTHR1), the truncated receptor was expressed in the cytosol of Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies. Oxidative refolding of inclusion body material resulted in stable, soluble, monomeric protein. Ligand binding was proved by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. Refolded receptor fragment was able to bind parathyroid hormone with an apparent dissociation constant of 3-5 microM. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra showed that the refolded polypeptide contained approximately 25% alpha-helical and 230eta-sheet secondary structures. Analysis of the disulfide bond pattern of the refolded receptor fragment revealed disulfide bonds between Cys170 and Cys131, Cys148 and Cys108, and Cys117 and Cys48. These results demonstrate that the extracellular N-terminal domain of the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR1) possesses a well-defined, stable conformation, which shows a significant ligand binding activity.	2000 Aug	Grauschopf U,Lilie H,Honold K,Wozny M,Reusch D,Esswein A,Schäfer W,Rücknagel K P,Rudolph R	Biochemistry. 39(30) 8878-87	Parathyroid hormone/parathyroid hormone-related peptide receptor	ALVDADDVMTKEEQIFLLHRAQAQCEKRLKEVLQRPASIMESDKGWTSASTSGKPRKDKASGKLYPESEEDKEAPTGSRYRGRPCLPEWDHILCWPLGAPGEVVAVPCPDYIYDFNHKGHAYRRCDRNGSWELVPGHNRTWANYSECVKFLTNETREREVFDRLGMI	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q03431			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
12651002	Expression and purification of Plasmodium falciparum MSP-1(42): A malaria vaccine candidate.	The C-terminal 42.10(3) Da portion of the merozoite surface protein (MSP-1) of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum is of interest, not only because it may constitute an essential part of a future anti-malaria vaccine, but also due to its role during the infection of erythrocytes by the parasite. We have cloned and expressed two synthetic DNA sequences encoding the two prototypic MSP-1(42) variants in E. coli. When over-produced, both proteins form insoluble aggregates which were isolated in high purity and yield. After solubilisation and refolding in vitro, both proteins were purified to homogeneity by a three-step procedure applying Ni-chelate, size exclusion and immuno-affinity chromatography. After purification, both proteins meet key criteria of preparations for clinical use. First, conformational studies suggest proper folding of the proteins, particularly in the region containing two EGF-like domains. Polyclonal serum raised against E. coli produced MSP-1(42) recognizes native MSP-1 in Plasmodium infected erythrocytes as shown by immunofluorescence.	2003 Mar	Epp Christian,Kauth Christian W,Bujard Hermann,Lutz Rolf	Journal of chromatography.

14519760	Generation of a recombinant, membrane-targeted form of the complement regulator CD59: activity in vitro and in vivo.	Inappropriate activation of complement contributes to pathology in diverse inflammatory diseases. Soluble recombinant forms of the natural cell membrane regulators of complement are effective in animal models and some human diseases. However, their use is limited for reasons related to cost, short half lives, and propensity to cause unwanted systemic effects. Some of these limitations may be overcome by use of bacterial expression systems, specific targeting moieties, and judicious choice of regulator. Here we describe the application of these strategies to the generation of a membrane-targeted form of CD59. A recombinant soluble form of rat CD59, comprising the first 71 residues of the mature protein and missing the membrane-anchoring signal, was expressed in bacteria, purified, and refolded in a fully active form. The protein was coupled through its carboxyl terminus to a short, synthetic address tag that confers membrane binding activity. Attachment of the membrane address tag markedly increased complement-inhibitory activity assessed in vitro in hemolysis assays. Intra-articular administration of the tagged agent markedly suppressed disease in a model of rheumatoid arthritis in Lewis rats. This novel type of agent, termed sCD59-APT542, offers for the first time the prospect of efficient and specific inhibition of membrane attack complex activity in vivo.	2003 Dec	Fraser Deborah A,Harris Claire L,Williams Anwen S,Mizuno Masashi,Gallagher Sean,Smith Richard A G,Morgan B Paul	The Journal of biological chemistry. 278(49) 48921-7	CD59 glycoprotein	LRCYNCLDPVSSCKTNSTCSPNLDACLVAVSGKQVYQQCWRFSDCNAKFILSRLEIANVQYRCCQADLCNKSFEDKPNN	c-terminal cysteine	O45037			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15681152	N-acetyl-D-galactosamine/N-acetyl-D-glucosamine--recognizing lectin from the snail Cepaea hortensis: purification, chemical characterization, cloning and expression in E. coli.	From the albumin gland of the snail Cepaea hortensis we isolated and characterized a new N-acetyl-D-galactosamine/N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GalNAc/GlcNAc) specific lectin (CHA-II) which was purified by a combination of affinity chromatography on GalNAc-agarose and gel filtration. The purified native lectin was found to be a multimeric protein, as revealed by SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF analysis. In SDS-PAGE the denatured and reduced lectin showed two bands of molecular masses with 17 and 15.5 kDa which reacted equally with anti-CHA-II rabbit antiserum. The lectin was O- and N-glycosylated with [(Gal)2-Man]2-Man-GlcNAc-GlcNAc-Asn as a probable structure for the oligosaccharide. Isoelectric focusing revealed a heterogeneous protein of at least four bands around pH 8.7. Tryptic peptides of CHA-II were N-terminally sequenced and highly degenerated gene specific oligonucleotide primers (GSPs) had been constructed. Using total RNA isolated from albumin glands, cDNAs were produced by the running race technique. Specific PCR fragments were obtained by PCR using GSPs, the universal primer and 5&#39;- or 3&#39;-RACE-cDNAs. The amplified fragments were cloned into the vector pDrive and were sequenced. The resulting total cDNA sequence consisted of 496 base pairs including an open reading frame of 360 base pairs which encoded a protein of 120 amino acids. The protein carried a putative signal peptide. The mature protein was predicted to comprise 99 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 11,239 Da. The PCR fragment encoding the mature protein was cloned into the vector pQE30 and expressed in E. coli. Recombinant CHA-II lectin was produced as inclusion bodies and extracted by 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. After refolding, the recombinant CHA-II agglutinated specifically human red blood cells of groups A and AB. In immunodiffusion experiments using rabbit antiserum raised against the native lectin, the protein showed a precipitation line of identity with the native lectin.	2005 Feb	Gerlach Dieter,Schlott Bernhard,Zähringer Ulrich,Schmidt Karl-Hermann	FEMS immunology and medical microbiology. 43(2) 223-32	CHA-II protein	AQTGEIDYGSDSSWPKVPSDDPNKDRTRELVKNVTFPSPYCRPPKVILSVTTLDSDHTKNLRYQARLKSVSPSGFSASSYTWHDTTIYRMKLSWLAVED	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q5F4K1			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
15972483	posttranslational modification of recombinant Plasmodium falciparum apical membrane antigen 1: impact on functional immune responses to a malaria vaccine candidate.	Recombinant apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA1) is a leading vaccine candidate for Plasmodium falciparum malaria, as antibodies against recombinant P. falciparum AMA1 (PfAMA1) interrupt merozoite invasion into erythrocytes. In order to investigate the role of posttranslational modification in modulating the functional immune response to recombinant AMA1, two separate alleles of PfAMA1 (FVO and 3D7), in which native N-glycosylation sites have been mutated, were produced using Escherichia coli and a Pichia pastoris expression system. Recombinant Pichia pastoris AMA1-FVO (PpAMA1-FVO) and PpAMA1-3D7 are O-linked glycosylated, and 450f PpAMA1-3D7 is nicked, though all four recombinant molecules react with conformation-specific monoclonal antibodies. To address the immunological effect of O-linked glycosylation, we compared the immunogenicity of E. coli AMA1-FVO (EcAMA1-FVO) and PpAMA1-FVO antigens, since both molecules are intact. The effect of antigen nicking was then investigated by comparing the immunogenicity of EcAMA1-3D7 and PpAMA1-3D7. Our data demonstrate that there is no significant difference in the rabbit antibody titer elicited towards EcAMA1-FVO and PpAMA1-FVO or to EcAMA1-3D7 and PpAMA1-3D7. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that recombinant AMA1 (FVO or 3D7), whether expressed and refolded from E. coli or produced from the Pichia expression system, is equivalent and mimics the functionality of the native protein in in vitro growth inhibition assay experiments. We conclude that in the case of recombinant AMA1, the E. coli- and P. pastoris-derived antigens are immunologically and functionally equivalent and are unaffected by the posttranslational modification resulting from expression in these two systems.	2005 Jul	Giersing Birgitte,Miura Kazutoyo,Shimp Richard,Wang Jin,Zhou Hong,Orcutt Andrew,Stowers Anthony,Saul Allan,Miller Louis H,Long Carole,Singh Sanjay	Infection and immunity. 73(7) 3963-70	Apical membrane antigen 1	LLSAFEFTYMINFGRGQNYWEHPYQKSDVYHPINEHREHPKEYEYPLHQEHTYQQEDSGEDENTLQHAYPIDHEGAEPAPQEQNLFSSIEIVERSNYMGNPWTEYMAKYDIEEVHGSGIRVDLGEDAEVAGTQYRLPSGKCPVFGKGIIIENSNTTFLKPVATGNQDLKDGGFAFPPTNPLISPMTLNGMRDFYKNNEYVKNLDELTLCSRHAGNMNPDNDKNSNYKYPAVYDYNDKKCHILYIAAQENNGPRYCNKDQSKRNSMFCFRPAKDKLFENYTYLSKNVVDNWEEVCPRKNLENAKFGLWVDGNCEDIPHVNEFSANDLFECNKLVFELSASDQPKQYEQHLTDYEKIKEGFKNKNASMIKSAFLPTGAFKADRYKSHGKGYNWGNYNRETQKCEIFNVKPTCLINNSSYIATTALSHPIEVEHNFPCSLYKDEIKKEIERESKRIKLNDNDDEGNKKIIAPRIFISDDKDSLKCPCDPEMVSNSTCRFFVCKCVERRAEVTSNNEVVVKEEYKDEYADIPEHKPTYDNMKIIIASSAAVAVLATILMVYLYKRKGNAEKYDKMDQPQHYGKSTSRNDEMLDPEASFWGEEKRASHTT	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9GVB7			10.5	24	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
10854444	Identification of a glutamic acid and an aspartic acid residue essential for catalytic activity of aspergillopepsin II, a non-pepsin type acid proteinase.	Aspergillopepsin II from Aspergillus niger var. macrosporus is a non-pepsin type or pepstatin-insensitive acid proteinase. To identify the catalytic residues of the enzyme, all acidic residues that are conserved in the homologous proteinases of family A4 were replaced with Asn, Gln, or Ala using site-directed mutagenesis. The wild-type and mutant pro-enzymes were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded in vitro. The wild-type pro-enzyme was shown to be processed into a two-chain active enzyme under acidic conditions. Most of the recombinant mutant pro-enzymes showed significant activity under acidic conditions because of autocatalytic activation except for the D123N, D123A, E219Q, and E219A mutants. The D123A, E219Q, and E219A mutants showed neither enzymatic activity nor autoprocessing activity under acidic conditions. The circular dichroism spectra of the mutant pro- and mature enzymes were essentially the same as those of the wild-type pro- and mature enzyme, respectively, indicating that the mutant pro-enzymes were correctly folded. In addition, two single and one double mutant pro-enzyme, D123E, E219D, and D123E/E219D, did not show enzymatic activity under acidic conditions. Taken together, Glu-219 and Asp-123 are deduced to be the catalytic residues of aspergillopepsin II.	2000 Aug	Huang X P,Kagami N,Inoue H,Kojima M,Kimura T,Makabe O,Suzuki K,Takahashi K	The Journal of biological chemistry. 275(34) 26607-14	Aspergillopepsin-2	EEYSSNWAGAVLIGDGYTKVTGEFTVPSVSAGSSGSSGYQSEEYCASAWVGIDGDTCETAILQTGVDFCYEDGQTSYDAWYEWYPDYAYDFSDITISEGDSIKVTVEATSKSSGSATVENLTTGQSVTHTFSGNVEGDLCETNAEWIVEDFESGDSLVAFADFGSVTFTNAEATSGGSTVGPSDATVMDIEQDGSVLTETSVSGDSVTVTYV					5.25	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16121289	Photocycle features of heterologously expressed and assembled eukaryotic flavin-binding BLUF domains of photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (PAC), a blue-light receptor in Euglena gracilis.	Photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (PAC) is a recently discovered blue-light photoreceptor that mediates photomovement in Euglena gracilis(Iseki et al., Nature, 2002, 415, 1047--1051). PAC appears to be a heterotetramer composed of two FAD-binding subunits (PACalpha and PACbeta). Both subunits have a pair of homologous regions (F1 and F2) which show homology with prokaryotic &quot;sensors of blue-light using FAD&quot;(BLUF) domains. The F1 and F2 domains of PAC are the only eukaryotic BLUF domains found thus far. We obtained soluble recombinant F1 and F2 proteins in PACalpha by heterologous expression with fused glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in E. coli. The expressed F1 samples did not bind flavins, but the F2 samples contained both FAD and FMN with trace amounts of riboflavin. We also assembled the histidine-tagged recombinant F2 (6His-F2) from inclusion bodies in E. coli with exogenous FAD or FMN. Blue-light-induced changes in absorption spectra of these assembled samples were highly similar to those reported for prokaryotic BLUF domains. The FAD- or FMN-assembled 6His-F2 photocycled with nearly the same rate constants of light-reaction and dark-relaxation, which were slightly lower than those of GST-cleaved F2. The estimated quantum efficiency for the phototransformation was 0.28--0.32, and the half-life was 34--44 s at 25 degrees C for the recombinant PACalpha F2, whereas that reported for prokaryotic BLUF domains varied from ca. 3.5 s (Tll0078) to ca. 900 s (AppA). The mutated recombinant Y472F and Q514G of PACalpha F2 and the F2 domain of the PACalpha homologue from Eutreptiella gymnastica, which lacks the Gln residue conserved in other BLUF domains, showed no photoinduced transformation.	2005 Sep	Ito Shinji,Murakami Akio,Sato Kyosuke,Nishina Yasuzo,Shiga Kiyoshi,Takahashi Tetsuo,Higashi Shoichi,Iseki Mineo,Watanabe Masakatsu	Photochemical &amp; photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology. 4(9) 762-9	Photoactivated adenylate cyclase subunit alpha	LRRLMYLSASTEPEKCNAEYLADMAHVATLRNKQIGVSGFLLYSSPFFFQVIEGTDEDLDFLFAKISADPRHERCIVLANGPCTGRMYGEWHMK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q8S9F2		BLUF 1	7	24	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

7514545	Receptor-binding domain of human alpha 2-macroglobulin. Expression, folding and biochemical characterization of a high-affinity recombinant derivative.	A recombinant version of the receptor binding domain (RBDv) of human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) has been expressed in E. coli and refolded using a novel iterative procedure. RBDv (Val1299-Ala1451) is extended by 15 residues at the N-terminal side of the Lys1313-Glu papain cleavage site in human alpha 2M. RBDv contains the intra-chain bridge Cys1329-Cys1444 and is soluble and monomeric. Competition experiments with 125I-labelled methylamine-treated alpha 2M reveal that RBDv binds to the placental receptor for transformed alpha 2M with a Kd of 8 nM, i.e. the binding affinity of RBDv is of the same order of magnitude as the intrinsic affinity for binding of one domain in transformed alpha 2M to one receptor molecule.	1994 May	Holtet T L,Nielsen K L,Etzerodt M,Moestrup S K,Gliemann J,Sottrup-Jensen L,Thøgersen H C	FEBS letters. 344(2-3) 242-6	Alpha-2-macroglobulin	LQQVSLPELPGEYSMKVTGEGCVYLQTSLKYNILPEKEEFPFALGVQTLPQTCDEPKAHTSFQISLSVSYTGSRSASNMAIVDVKMVSGFIPLKPTVKMLERSNHVSRTEVSSNHVLIYLDKVSNQTLSLFFTVLQDVPVRDLKPAIVKVYD	ScFX	P01023		alpha2 M-RBD (res. 1299-1451)	8	25	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

16269515	Two wrongs can make a right: dimers of prolactin and growth hormone receptor antagonists behave as agonists.	Prolactin (PRL) and GH have two distinct binding sites (site 1 with high affinity; site 2 with low affinity) that each interact with a PRL receptor (PRLR) to form a functional receptor dimer that activates signal transduction. The G129R mutation in PRL and the G120R mutation in GH disrupt the structural integrity of site 2 such that the ligands retain the ability to bind to the first receptor with high affinity, but act as receptor antagonists. In this study, we examined the ability of monomeric and dimeric forms of these ligands, human (h) PRL and hGH, and their antagonists (hPRL-G129R and hGH-G120R) to 1) bind to PRLRs; 2) induce conformational changes in PRLRs; 3) activate signaling pathways associated with the PRLR; and 4) mediate cell proliferation in vitro. In contrast to monomeric hPRL-G129R, homodimeric hPRL-G129R induced PRLR dimerization; activated Janus family of tyrosine kinases 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5, Ras/Raf/MAPK kinase/Erk, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling; and stimulated Nb2 cell proliferation. Similarly, homodimeric hGH-G120R was able to mediate signaling via the PRLR and to stimulate Nb2 cell proliferation. These experiments demonstrate that a ligand must have two functional binding sites, but that these may be site 1 plus site 2 or two site 1&#39;s, to elicit receptor-mediated signal transduction. The size of the ligand plays less of a role in receptor activation, suggesting that the extracellular portion of the PRLR (and possibly the GH receptor) is rather flexible and can accommodate larger ligands. These findings may have implications for designing multifunctional therapeutics that target this class of cytokine receptors.	2006 Mar	Langenheim John F,Tan Dunyong,Walker Ameae M,Chen Wen Y	Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.). 20(3) 661-74	Prolactin	LPICPGGAARCQVTLRDLFDRAVVLSHYIHNLSSEMFSEFDKRYTHGRGFITKAINSCHTSSLATPEDKEQAQQMNQKDFLSLIVSILRSWNEPLYHLVTEVRGMQEAPEAILSKAVEIEEQTKRLLEGMELIVSQVHPETKENEIYPVWSGLPSLQMADEESRLSAYYNLLHCLRRDSHKIDNYLKLLKCRIIHNNNC		P01236			8	0	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
15975927	CCR5 N-terminal region plays a critical role in HIV-1 inhibition by Toxoplasma gondii-derived cyclophilin-18.	Molecular mimicry of chemokine ligands has been described for several pathogens. Toxoplasma gondii produces a protein, cyclophilin-18 (C-18), which binds to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-receptor CCR5 and inhibits fusion and infection of T cells and macrophages by R5 viruses but not by X4 viruses. We recently identified structural determinants of C-18 required for anti-HIV activity (Yarovinsky, F., Andersen, J. F., King, L. R., Caspar, P., Aliberti, J., Golding, H., and Sher, A. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 53635-53642). Here we have elucidated the fine specificity of CCR5 residues involved in binding and HIV inhibitory potential of C-18. To delineate the regions of CCR5 involved in C-18 binding, we analyzed C-18 inhibition of cells expressing CXCR4/CCR5 chimeric receptors and CCR5 with a truncated N terminus (Delta2-19). These experiments identified a critical role for the N terminus of CCR5 in C-18 binding and anti-HIV activity. Studies with a large panel of CCR5 N-terminal peptides, including Tyr-sulfated analogues, truncated peptides, and alanine-scanning mutants, suggested that each of the 12-17 amino acids in the N terminus of CCR5 are essential for C-18 binding and inhibitory activity. Tyr sulfation did not improve C-18 reactivity. This finding is of interest because the same CCR5 N-terminal region was shown previously to play a key role in binding of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins. The elucidation of the functional C-18-binding mechanism may help in the rational design of novel antiviral agents against HIV.	2005 Aug	Golding Hana,Khurana Surender,Yarovinsky Felix,King Lisa R,Abdoulaeva Galina,Antonsson Liselotte,Owman Christer,Platt Emily J,Kabat David,Andersen John F,Sher Alan	The Journal of biological chemistry. 280(33) 29570-7	18 kDa cyclophilin, Cyclophilin-18	ENAGVRKAYMDIDIDGEHAGRIILELREDIAPKTVKNFIGLFDKYKGSVFHRIIPDFMIQGGDFENHNGTGGHSIYGRRFDDENFDLKHERGVISMANAGPNTNGSQFFITTVKTEWLDARHVVFGKITTESWPTVQAIEALGGSGGRPSKVAKITDIGLLE		Q26994			8	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
12665855	Molecular mimicry of a CCR5 binding-domain in the microbial activation of dendritic cells.	Toxoplasma gondii releases factors that potently stimulate production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) from dendritic cells (DCs). Purification of this activity showed that cyclophilin-18 (C-18) was its principal component, and antibodies generated against recombinant C-18 inhibited tachyzoite extract-induced synthesis of IL-12. Recombinant C-18 showed high affinity for and triggered cell signaling through CCR5, a chemokine receptor important in parasite-induced IL-12 production by DCs. These findings suggest that the unusual potency of T. gondii in inducing IL-12 from DCs results from its synthesis of a unique chemokine mimic that signals through CCR5. The ability to generate this strong protective response may benefit parasite transmission by preventing the protozoan from overwhelming its intermediate hosts.	2003 May	Aliberti Julio,Valenzuela Jesus G,Carruthers Vern B,Hieny Sara,Andersen John,Charest Hugues,Reis e Sousa Caetano,Fairlamb Alan,Ribeiro Jose M,Sher Alan	Nature immunology. 4(5) 485-90	18 kDa cyclophilin, Cyclophilin-18	ENAGVRKAYMDIDIDGEHAGRIILELREDIAPKTVKNFIGLFDKYKGSVFHRIIPDFMIQGGDFENHNGTGGHSIYGRRFDDENFDLKHERGVISMANAGPNTNGSQFFITTVKTEWLDARHVVFGKITTESWPTVQAIEALGGSGGRPSKVAKITDIGLLE		Q26994			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
16199570	Cnu, a novel oriC-binding protein of Escherichia coli.	We have found, using a newly developed genetic method, a protein (named Cnu, for oriC-binding nucleoid-associated) that binds to a specific 26-base-pair sequence (named cnb) in the origin of replication of Escherichia coli, oriC. Cnu is composed of 71 amino acids (8.4 kDa) and shows extensive amino acid identity to a group of proteins belonging to the Hha/YmoA family. Cnu was previously discovered as a protein that, like Hha, complexes with H-NS in vitro. Our in vivo and in vitro assays confirm the results and further suggest that the complex formation with H-NS is involved in Cnu/Hha binding to cnb. Unlike the hns mutants, elimination of either the cnu or hha gene did not disturb the growth rate, origin content, and synchrony of DNA replication initiation of the mutants compared to the wild-type cells. However, the cnu hha double mutant was moderately reduced in origin content. The Cnu/Hha complex with H-NS thus could play a role in optimal activity of oriC.	2005 Oct	Kim Myung Suk,Bae Sung-Hun,Yun Sang Hoon,Lee Hee Jung,Ji Sang Chun,Lee Ji Hyun,Srivastava Preeti,Lee Seol-Hoon,Chae Huiseok,Lee Younghoon,Choi Byong-Seok,Chattoraj Dhruba K,Lim Heon M	Journal of bacteriology. 187(20) 6998-7008	OriC-binding nucleoid-associated protein	MTVQDYLLKFRKISSLESLEKLYDHLNYTLTDDQELINMYRAADHRRAELVSGGRLFDLGQVPKSVWHYVQ	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P64467			8	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

18569875	Overexpression, refolding, purification of Erbin PDZ domain from Escherichia coli and preparation of its polyclonal antibody.	The Erbin was recently identified. The antibody against Erbin has not been commercially available. As a new member of peripheral protein LAP family and novel type of adaptor protein, its functions and binding partners are not completely known. In the present study, cDNA encoding PDZ domain of Erbin was inserted in a prokaryotic expression vector. His-tagged recombinant protein was overproduced in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA column chromatography. About 14.4 mg of the purified protein was obtained from 500 mL of cell culture. The purity of the recombinant protein was higher than 90%. The polyclonal antibody against this protein was raised. The antibody can recognize both denatured and natural Erbin protein. It will be used to further identify the new binding partners of Erbin and study its unknown functions.	2008 	Zhang H,Yu M,Hu M,Qian L,Chen L,Shi M,Shen B,Guo N	Preparative biochemistry &amp; biotechnology. 38(3) 282-93	Erbin also known as Protein LAP2	EIRVRVEKDPELGFSISGGVGGRGNPFRPDDDGIFVTRVQPEGPASKLLQPGDKIIQANGYSFINIEHGQAVSLLKTFQNTVELIIVREV	N-terminal +C terminal hexahistidine tag	Q96RT1		PDZ domain	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
18502664	Expression, purification and characterization of pectin methylesterase inhibitor from kiwi fruit in Escherichia coli.	A significant problem in production of fruit juices for human consumption is auto-clarification, where enzyme catalyzes pectin demethylation resulting in loss of the &#39;&#39;natural&quot; cloudy appearance of juices. To overcome this problem, a plant inhibitor protein which blocks the action of pectin methylesterase has been used. In this paper, expression of recombinant kiwi pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI) was carried out in Escherichia coli, and the target protein was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. The expression level reached 460f total cell protein. Then the fusion protein was purified by nickel ion metal affinity chromatography, and the purity was finally up to 98%. After refolding in GSH/GSSG redox system, recombinant PMEI not only could efficiently inhibit PMEs from eight different plants, but could remain effective inhibitor activity in the pH 3.0-10.0 and 20-40 degrees C. Thus, recombinant PMEI has potential application in the production of fruit juices product industry.	2008 Aug	Hao Yanling,Huang Xinyi,Mei Xiaohong,Li Ruoyu,Zhai Zhengyuan,Yin Sheng,Huang Ying,Luo Yunbo	Protein expression and purification. 60(2) 221-4	Pectinesterase inhibitor	ENHLISEICPKTRNPSLCLQALESDPRSASKDLKGLGQFSIDIAQASAKQTSKIIASLTNQATDPKLKGRYETCSENYADAIDSLGQAKQFLTSGDYNSLNIYASAAFDGAGTCEDSFEGPPNIPTQLHQADLKLEDLCDIVLVISNLLPGS	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P83326				4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18628952	Protein solubility and folding enhancement by interaction with RNA.	While basic mechanisms of several major molecular chaperones are well understood, this machinery has been known to be involved in folding of only limited number of proteins inside the cells. Here, we report a chaperone type of protein folding facilitated by interaction with RNA. When an RNA-binding module is placed at the N-terminus of aggregation-prone target proteins, this module, upon binding with RNA, further promotes the solubility of passenger proteins, potentially leading to enhancement of proper protein folding. Studies on in vitro refolding in the presence of RNA, coexpression of RNA molecules in vivo and the mutants with impaired RNA binding ability suggests that RNA can exert chaperoning effect on their bound proteins. The results suggest that RNA binding could affect the overall kinetic network of protein folding pathway in favor of productive folding over off-pathway aggregation. In addition, the RNA binding-mediated solubility enhancement is extremely robust for increasing soluble yield of passenger proteins and could be usefully implemented for high-throughput protein expression for functional and structural genomic research initiatives. The RNA-mediated chaperone type presented here would give new insights into de novo folding in vivo.	2008 	Choi Seong Il,Han Kyoung Sim,Kim Chul Woo,Ryu Ki-Sun,Kim Byung Hee,Kim Kyun-Hwan,Kim Seo-Il,Kang Tae Hyun,Shin Hang-Cheol,Lim Keo-Heun,Kim Hyo Kyung,Hyun Jeong-Min,Seong Baik L	PloS one. 3(7) e2677	Lysyl-tRNA synthetase	SEQHAQGADAVVDLNNELKTRREKLANLREQGIAFPNDFRRDHTSDQLHAEFDGKENEELEALNIEVAVAGRMMTRRIMGKASFVTLQDVGGRIQLYVARDDLPEGVYNEQFKKWDLGDILGAKGKLFKTKTGELSIHCTELRLLTKALRPLPDKFHGLQDQEARYRQRYLDLISNDESRNTFKVRSQILSGIRQFMVNRGFMEVETPMMQVIPGGAAARPFITHHNALDLDMYLRIAPELYLKRLVVGGFERVFEINRNFRNEGISVRHNPEFTMMELYMAYADYKDLIELTESLFRTLAQDILGKTEVTYGDVTLDFGKPFEKLTMREAIKKYRPETDMADLDNFDSAKAIAESIGIHVEKSWGLGRIVTEIFEEVAEAHLIQPTFITEYPAEVSPLARRNDVNPEITDRFEFFIGGREIGNGFSELNDAEDQAQRFLDQVAAKDAGDDEAMFYDEDYVTALEHGLPPTAGLGIGIDRMVMLFTNSHTIRDVILFPAMRPVK	N terminal hexa His tag + TEV cleavage sequence	P0A8N3			7.8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18640277	Isotopically labeled expression in E. coli, purification, and refolding of the full ectodomain of the influenza virus membrane fusion protein.	This paper describes methods to produce an isotopically labeled 23 kDa viral membrane protein with purified yield of 20 mg/L of Escherichia coli shake flask culture. This yield is sufficient for NMR structural studies and the protein production methods are simple, straightforward, and rapid and likely applicable to other recombinant membrane proteins expressed in E. coli. The target FHA2 protein is the full ectodomain construct of the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein which catalyzes fusion between the viral and the cellular endosomal membranes during infection. The high yield of FHA2 was achieved by: (1) initial growth in rich medium to A(600) approximately 8 followed by a switch to minimal medium and induction of protein expression; and (2) obtaining protein both from purification of the detergent-soluble lysate and from solubilization, purification, and refolding of inclusion bodies. The high cell density was achieved after optimization of pH, oxygenation, and carbon source and concentration, and the refolding protocol was optimized using circular dichroism spectroscopy. For a single residue of membrane-associated FHA2 that was obtained from purification and refolding of inclusion bodies, native conformation was verified by the (13)CO chemical shifts measured using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.	2008 Oct	Curtis-Fisk Jaime,Spencer Ryan M,Weliky David P	Protein expression and purification. 61(2) 212-9	Hemagglutinin	GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGMIDGWYGFRHQNSEGTGQAADLKSTQAAIDQINGKLNRVIEKTNEKFHQIEKEFSEVEGRIQDLEKYVEDTKIDLWSYNAELLVALENQHTIDLTDSEMNKLFEKTRRQLRENAEEMGNGCFKIYHKCDNACIESIRNGTYDHDVYRDEALNNRFQIKGVELKSGYKDWILWISFAISCFLLCVVLLGFIMWACQRGNIRCNICI	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P03437			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
18754048	Recombinant Metridia luciferase isoforms: expression, refolding and applicability for in vitro assay.	The recombinant coelenterazine-dependent luciferases (isoforms MLuc164 and MLuc39) from the marine copepod Metridia longa were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli cells, dissolved in 6 M guanidinium chloride and folded in conditions developed for proteins containing intramolecular disulfide bonds. One of them (MLuc39) was obtained in an active monomeric form with a high yield. The luciferase bioluminescence is found to be initiated not only by free coelenterazine, but also by Ca2+-dependent coelenterazine-binding protein (CBP) of Renilla muelleri on Ca2+ addition. The use of CBP as a &quot;substrate&quot; provides higher light emission and simultaneously the lower level of background. The high purity MLuc39 can be detected down to attomol with a linear range extending over 5 orders of magnitude. The MLuc39 reveals also a high stability towards heating and chemical modification; the chemically synthesized biotinylated derivatives of the luciferase preserve 35-400f the initial activity. The luciferase applicability as an in vitro bioluminescent reporter is demonstrated in model tandem bioluminescent solid-phase microassay combining the Ca2+-regulated photoprotein obelin and the Metridia luciferase.	2008 Sep	Borisova Vasilisa V,Frank Ludmila A,Markova Svetlana V,Burakova Ludmila P,Vysotski Eugene S	Photochemical &amp; photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology. 7(9) 1025-31	Secreted luciferase	KSTEFDPNIDIVGLEGKFGITNLETDLFTIWETMEVMIKADIADTDRASNFVATETDANRGKMPGKKLPLAVIMEMEANAFKAGCTRGCLICLSKIKCTAKMKVYIPGRCHDYGGDKKTGQAGIVGAIVDIPEISGFKEMAPMEQFIAQVDRCASCTTGCLKGLANVKCSELLKKWLPDRCASFADKIQKEVHNIKGMAGDR		Q6UQE3			8.8	8	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
18771584	Var2CSA DBL6-epsilon domain expressed in HEK293 induces limited cross-reactive and blocking antibodies to CSA binding parasites.	BACKGROUND:Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is a serious consequence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes sequestration in the placenta through the adhesion to the placental receptor chondroitin sulfate A (CSA). Although women become resistant to PAM as they acquire transcending inhibitory immunity against CSA-binding parasites, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved if a prophylactic vaccine targeting the surface proteins of placental parasites could be designed. Recent works point to the variant protein var2CSA as the key target for the development of a pregnancy-associated malaria vaccine. However, designing such a prophylactic vaccine has been hindered by the difficulty in identifying regions of var2CSA that could elicit broadly neutralizing and adhesion-blocking antibodies.METHODS:Var2CSA is a very large protein with an estimated molecular weight of 350 kDa, and can be divided into six cysteine rich Duffy binding-like domains (DBL). The human embryonic kidney 293 cell line (HEK293) was used to produce secreted soluble recombinant forms of var2CSA DBL domains. The Escherichia coli expression system was also assessed for the domains not expressed or expressed in low amount in the HEK293 system. To investigate whether var2CSA binding DBL domains can induce biologically active antibodies recognizing the native var2CSA and blocking the interaction, mice were immunized with the refolded DBL3-X or the HEK293 secreted DBL6-epsilon domains.RESULTS:Using the HEK293 expression system, DBL1-X, DBL4-epsilon and DBL6-epsilon were produced at relatively high levels in the culture supernatant, while DBL3-X and DBL5-epsilon were produced at much lower levels. DBL2-X and DBL3-X domains were obtained after refolding of the inclusion bodies produced in E. coli. Importantly, mice antisera raised against the recombinant DBL6-epsilon domain, specifically reacted against the surface of CSA-binding parasites and revealed adhesion blocking activity.CONCLUSION:This is the first report showing inhibitory binding antibodies obtained through a var2CSA recombinant DBL domain immunization protocol. These results support the current strategies using var2CSA as immunogen in the aim of blocking placental sequestration of malaria parasites. This work is a step towards the development of a var2CSA based vaccine that will prevent pregnancy-associated malaria and improve pregnancy outcomes.	2008 	Fernandez Pablo,Viebig Nicola K,Dechavanne Sébastien,Lépolard Catherine,Gysin Jürg,Scherf Artur,Gamain Benoit	Malaria journal. 7 170	 Erythrocyte membrane protein 1	LEKVFASLTNGYKCDKCKSGTSRSKKKWIWKKSSGNEEGLQEEYANTIGLPPRTQSLYLGNLPKLENVCEDVKDINFDTKEKFLAGCLIVSFHEGKNLKKRYPQNKNSGNKENLCKALEYSFADYGDLIKGTSIWDNEYTKDLELNLQNNFGKLFGKYIKKNNTAEQDTSYSSLDELRESWWNTNKKYIWTAMKHGAEMNITTCNADGSVTGSGSSCDDIPTIDLIPQYLRFLQEWVENFCEQRQAKVKDVITNCKSCKESGNKCKTECKTKCKDECEKYKKFIEACGTAGGGIGTAGSPWSKRWDQIYKRYSKHIEDAKRNRKAGTKNCGTSLNATNYIRGCQSKTYDGKIFPGKGGEKQWICKDTIIHGDTNGACIPPRTQNLCVGELWDKSYGGRSNIKNDTKELLKEKIKNAIHKETELLYEYHDTGTAIISKNDKKGQKGKNDPNGLPKGFCHAVQRSFIDYKNMILGTSVNIYEHIGKLQEDIKKIIEKGTPQQKDKIGGVGSSTENVNAWWKGIEREMWDAVRCAITKINKKNNNSIFNGDECGVSPPTGNDEDQSVSWFKEWGEQFCIERLRYEQNIREACTINGKNEKKCINSKSGQGDKIQGACKRKCEKYKKYISEKKQEWDKQKTKYENKYVGKSASDLLKENYPECIS	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q6UDW7		DBL2-X (residues 530-863) and DBL3-X (residues 1221-1548)	8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
18725331	Simultaneous refolding and purification of a recombinant lipase with an intein tag by affinity precipitation with chitosan.	A strategy for simultaneous purification and refolding of proteins overexpressed with an intein tag is described. A recombinant lipase overexpressed in Escherichia coli ER2566 with the intein tag and obtained as inclusion bodies was solubilized in buffer containing 8 M urea or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. The solubilized lipase was precipitated with chitosan and the affinity complex of the polymer with the fusion protein was obtained. The intein tag was cleaved with dithiothreitol and the refolded lipase was obtained in active form. Activity recovery of 80% was observed and the enzyme had a specific activity of 2965 units/mg. The purified lipase showed a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purity and activity recovery were comparable with that of the preparation obtained by using the commercial kit which utilizes chromatography on chitin beads. The purified and refolded lipase was characterized by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy.	2008 Nov	Singh Pradeep K,Gupta Munishwar N	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1784(11) 1825-9	Lipase	AAGYAATRYPIILVHGLSGTDKYAGVLEYWYGIQEDLQQNGATVYVANLSGFQSDDGPNGRGEQLLAYVKTVLAATGATKVNLVGHSQGGLSSRYVAAVAPDLVASVTTIGTPHRGSEFADFVQDVLAYDPTGLSSSVIAAFVNVFGILTSSSHNTNQDALAALQTLTTARAATYNQNYPSAGLGAPGSCQTGAPTETVGGNTHLLYSWAGTAIQPTLSVFGVTGATDTSTLPLVDPANVLDLSTLALFGTGTVMINRGSGQNDGLVSKCSALYGKVLSTSYKWNHLDEINQLLGVRGAYAEDPVAVIRTHANRLKLAGV	C-terminal intein	P22088			8	20	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f

18785020	Refolding of a staphylokinase variant y1-Sak by reverse dilution.	To develop more potent thrombolytic agents with fibrinolytic and antiplatelet aggregation activity, staphylokinase (Sak) variant Y1-Sak, a recombinant mutant of the Staphylococcus aureus protein Sak, was constructed. Y1-Sak formed an insoluble inclusion body when overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain JF1125. To obtain an optimized refolding process, dilution refolding was used to optimize refolding conditions. The results revealed that additive L: -arginine and refolding temperature played critical roles in the refolding of Y1-Sak. Subsequently, two refolding methods, gel filtration and reverse dilution, were investigated to refold Y1-Sak. The results indicated that the fibrinolytic activity and recovery of Y1-Sak from gel filtration were lower than those from reverse dilution. Reverse dilution refolding successfully reduced the side reaction of refolding with the help of L: -arginine, and the fibrinolytic activity and recovery of Y1-Sak were significantly improved. Functional analysis revealed that refolded Y1-Sak by reverse dilution possessed fibrinolytic and antiplatelet aggregation activities. Moreover, the immunogenicity of Y1-Sak was significantly reduced.	2008 Oct	He Jintian,Wang Gaizhen,Xu Ruiguang,Feng Jinlin,Wang Jinlong,Su Huabo,Song Houyan	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 151(1) 29-41	Staphylokinase	SSSFDKGKYKKGDDASYFEPTGPYLMVNVTGVDGKGNELLSPHYVEFPIKPGTTLTKEKIEYYVEWALDATAYKEFRVVELDPSAKIEVTYYDKNKKKEETKSFPITEKGFVVPDLSEHIKNPGFNLITKVVIEKK		P68802			7.4	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

18780821	Refolding and simultaneous purification by three-phase partitioning of recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies.	Many recombinant eukaryotic proteins tend to form insoluble aggregates called inclusion bodies, especially when expressed in Escherichia coli. We report the first application of the technique of three-phase partitioning (TPP) to obtain correctly refolded active proteins from solubilized inclusion bodies. TPP was used for refolding 12 different proteins overexpressed in E. coli. In each case, the protein refolded by TPP gave either higher refolding yield than the earlier reported method or succeeded where earlier efforts have failed. TPP-refolded proteins were characterized and compared to conventionally purified proteins in terms of their spectral characteristics and/or biological activity. The methodology is scaleable and parallelizable and does not require subsequent concentration steps. This approach may serve as a useful complement to existing refolding strategies of diverse proteins from inclusion bodies.	2008 Nov	Raghava Smita,Barua Bipasha,Singh Pradeep K,Das Mili,Madan Lalima,Bhattacharyya Sanchari,Bajaj Kanika,Gopal B,Varadarajan Raghavan,Gupta Munishwar N	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 17(11) 1987-97	Ribonuclease pancreatic	KETAAAKFERQHMDSSTSAASSSNYCNQMMKSRNLTKDRCKPVNTFVHESLADVQAVCSQKNVACKNGQTNCYQSYSTMSITDCRETGSSKYPNCAYKTTQANKHIIVACEGNPYVPVHFDASV		P61823			7.5	25	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18824105	Purification, refolding and autoactivation of the recombinant cysteine proteinase EhCP112 from Entamoeba histolytica.	The cysteine proteinase EhCP112 and the adhesin EhADH112 assemble to form the EhCPADH complex involved in Entamoeba histolytica virulence. To further characterize this cysteine proteinase, the recombinant full-length EhCP112 enzyme was expressed and purified under denaturing conditions. After a refolding step under reductive conditions, the inactive precursor (ppEhCP112) was processed to a 35.5 kDa mature and active enzyme (EhCP112). The thiol specific inhibitor E-64, but not serine or aspartic proteinase inhibitors arrested this activation process. The activation step of the proenzyme followed by the mature enzyme suggests an autocatalytic process during EhCP112 maturation. The experimentally determined processing sites observed during EhCP112 activation lie close to processing sites of other cysteine proteinases from parasites. The kinetic parameters of the mature EhCP112 were determined using hemoglobin and azocasein as substrates. The proteinase activity of EhCP112 was completely inhibited by thiol inhibitors, E-64, TLCK, and chymostatin, but not by general proteinase inhibitors. Since EhCP112 is a proteinase involved in the virulence of E. histolytica, a reliable source of active EhCP112 is a key step for its biochemical characterization and to carry out future protein structure-function studies.	2009 Jan	Quintas-Granados Laura I,Orozco Esther,Brieba Luis G,Arroyo Rossana,Ortega-López Jaime	Protein expression and purification. 63(1) 26-32	Cysteine proteinase	MTAIVVAFLLLVSNQKTQSIAFNLELPVDKLFIQFKTKYNKHYSLTEEQFRFQIFKNNLKNIKTLNEKRTQPSDAFHDINMYTDLIDEELPISKGMAIPVSSYDNEHFNSKELKKVEKPWNEVPPLPSGDNLPQNYAFCGEYVSKNTDRPKVDLCGEVFSQQNCGGCWAVSLANLAQYLYSNLTYQRYGCIKTPPKFSAQRFLDVTKTKATKRLLWWSSSRRCLIAVKSFSLDADYPFVDGPNKNVCTIRGDQNPNVQIQMAITGYKTFGISKDQNMVLLLKKLLHHYGPFLVSVKVSGTGFSSYSSGIFSFPSSSICDTSSSSFMTDHEVVLMDGYRECVEYFIIRNSWASGWGEGDNYIRIKTTNLCGIGWRIGDYVYPLNMIVYANTCKLDKYCSSCNISSNICSSCVSGYYLNSNNKCVKNTAKLVKYHSNSTYVQFYNHTI	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q9U7F7			8	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Increasing the expression yield of active Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) in Escherichia coli was achieved by using a codon-optimized synthetic gene and by mutagenesis to introduce hydrophilic residues on the surface of CAL-B. Five residues (four leucines and one isoleucine) on the surface of CAL-B were selected and changed with aspartate after codon optimization. While the codon-optimized synthetic gene of CAL-B did not increase the expression yield, the mutation increased the activity of the enzyme three-fold (3.3 mg/l of culture) compared to the wild type. The mutant enzyme had similar hydrolytic activity toward hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate or p-nitrophenyl butyrate and enantioselectivity toward hydrolysis of (R, S)-1-phenylethyl acetate compared to the wild-type enzyme.	2008 Apr	Jung Suhyun,Park Seongsoon	Biotechnology letters. 30(4) 717-22	Lipase chaperone	MTARGGRAPLARRAVVYGAVGLAAVAGVAMWSGAGRHGGTGASGEPPDASAARGPAAAPPQAAVPASTSLPPSLAGSSAPRLPLDAGGHLAKSRAVRDFFDYCLTAQSDLSAAGLDAFVVREIAAQLDGTVAQAEALDVWHRYRAYLDALAKLRDAGAVDKSDLGALQLALDQRASIAYRTLGDWSQPFFGAEQWRQRYDLARLKIAQDPALTDAQKAERLAALEQQMPADERAAQQRVDRQRAAIDQIAQLQKSGATPDAMRAQLTQTLGPEAAVRVAQMQQDDASWQSRYADYAAQRAQIESAGLSPQDRDAQIAALRQRMFTKPGEAVRAASLDRGAGSAR		Q6B4I0			7.2	4	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

For a single residue of membrane-associated FHA2 that was obtained from purification and refolding of inclusion bodies, native conformation was verified by the (13)CO chemical shifts measured using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.	2008 Oct	Curtis-Fisk Jaime,Spencer Ryan M,Weliky David P	Protein expression and purification. 61(2) 212-9	 Hemagglutinin HA2 chain	GLFGAIAGFIENGWEGMIDGWYGFRHQNSEGTGQAADLKSTQAAIDQINGKLNRVIEKTNEKFHQIEKEFSEVEGRIQDLEKYVEDTKIDLWSYNAELLVALENQHTIDLTDSEMNKLFEKTRRQLRENAEEMGNGCFKIYHKCDNACIESIRNGTYDHDVYRDEALNNRFQIKGVELKSGYKDWILWISFAISCFLLCVVLLGFIMWACQRGNIRCNICI	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	P03437			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f
18926799	SARS coronavirus: unusual lability of the nucleocapsid protein.	The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious disease that killed hundreds and sickened thousands of people worldwide between November 2002 and July 2003. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the coronavirus responsible for this disease plays a critical role in viral assembly and maturation and is of particular interest because of its potential as an antiviral target or vaccine candidate. Refolding of SARS N-protein during production and purification showed the presence of two additional protein bands by SDS-PAGE. Mass spectroscopy (MALDI, SELDI, and LC/MS) confirmed that the bands are proteolytic products of N-protein and the cleavage sites are four SR motifs in the serine-arginine-rich region-sites not suggestive of any known protease. Furthermore, results of subsequent testing for contaminating protease(s) were negative: cleavage appears to be due to inherent instability and/or autolysis. The importance of N-protein proteolysis to viral life cycle and thus to possible treatment directions are discussed.	2008 Dec	Mark John,Li Xuguang,Cyr Terry,Fournier Sylvie,Jaentschke Bozena,Hefford Mary Alice	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 377(2) 429-33	Nucleocapsid protein	MSDNGPQSNQRSAPRITFGGPTDSTDNNQNGGRNGARPKQRRPQGLPNNTASWFTALTQHGKEELRFPRGQGVPINTNSGPDDQIGYYRRATRRVRGGDGKMKELSPRWYFYYLGTGPEASLPYGANKEGIVWVATEGALNTPKDHIGTRNPNNNAATVLQLPQGTTLPKGFYAEGSRGGSQASSRSSSRSRGNSRNSTPGSSRGNSPARMASGGGETALALLLLDRLNQLESKVSGKGQQQQGQTVTKKSAAEASKKPRQKRTATKQYNVTQAFGRRGPEQTQGNFGDQDLIRQGTDYKHWPQIAQFAPSASAFFGMSRIGMEVTPSGTWLTYHGAIKLDDKDPQFKDNVILLNKHIDAYKTFPPTEPKKDKKKKTDEAQPLPQRQKKQPTVTLLPAADMDDFSRQLQNSMSGASADSTQA	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	P59595			8	1	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
18922802	Structure of human prostasin, a target for the regulation of hypertension.	Prostasin (also called channel activating protease-1 (CAP1)) is an extracellular serine protease implicated in the modulation of fluid and electrolyte regulation via proteolysis of the epithelial sodium channel. Several disease states, particularly hypertension, can be affected by modulation of epithelial sodium channel activity. Thus, understanding the biochemical function of prostasin and developing specific agents to inhibit its activity could have a significant impact on a widespread disease. We report the expression of the prostasin proenzyme in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies, refolding and activating via proteolytic removal of the N-terminal propeptide. The refolded and activated enzyme was shown to be pure and monomeric, with kinetic characteristics very similar to prostasin expressed from eukaryotic systems. Active prostasin was crystallized, and the structure was determined to 1.45 A resolution. These apoprotein crystals were soaked with nafamostat, allowing the structure of the inhibited acyl-enzyme intermediate structure to be determined to 2.0 A resolution. Comparison of the inhibited and apoprotein forms of prostasin suggest a mechanism of regulation through stabilization of a loop which interferes with substrate recognition.	2008 Dec	Rickert Keith W,Kelley Paul,Byrne Noel J,Diehl Ronald E,Hall Dawn L,Montalvo Allison M,Reid John C,Shipman Jennifer M,Thomas Bradley W,Munshi Sanjeev K,Darke Paul L,Su Hua-Poo	The Journal of biological chemistry. 283(50) 34864-72	Prostasin	AEAPCGVAPQARITGGSSAVAGQWPWQVSITYEGVHVCGGSLVSEQWVLSAAHCFPSEHHKEAYEVKLGAHQLDSYSEDAKVSTLKDIIPHPSYLQEGSQGDIALLQLSRPITFSRYIRPICLPAANASFPNGLHCTVTGWGHVAPSVSLLTPKPLQQLEVPLISRETCNCLYNIDAKPEEPHFVQEDMVCAGYVEGGKDACQGDSGGPLSCPVEGLWYLTGIVSWGDACGARNRPGVYTLASSYASWIQSKVTELQPRVVPQTQESQPDSNLCGSHLAFSSAPAQGLLRPILFLPLGLALGLLSPWLSEH		Q16651			8	1	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
12880763	Production and purification of refolded recombinant human IL-7 from inclusion bodies.	A recombinant form of human rhIL-7 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli HMS174 (DE3) pLysS under the control of a T7 promoter. The resulting insoluble inclusion bodies were separated from cellular debris by cross-flow filtration and solubilized by homogenization with 6 M guanidine HCl. Attempts at refolding rhIL-7 from solubilized inclusion bodies without prior purification of monomeric, denatured rhIL-7 were not successful. Denatured, monomeric rhIL-7 was therefore initially purified by size-exclusion chromatography using Prep-Grade Pharmacia Superdex 200. Correctly folded rhIL-7 monomer was generated by statically refolding the denatured protein at a final protein concentration of 80-100 microg/ml in 100 mM Tris, 2mM EDTA, 500 mM L-arginine, pH 9.0, buffer with 0.55 g/l oxidized glutathione at 2-8 degrees C for at least 48 h. The refolded rhIL-7 was subsequently purified by low-pressure liquid chromatography, using a combination of hydrophobic interaction, cation-exchange, and size-exclusion chromatography. The purified final product was &gt;95d0c850ure by SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie brilliant blue, high-pressure size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC), and reverse-phase HPLC. The endotoxin level was &lt;0.05 EU/mg. The final purified product was biologically active in a validated IL-7 dependent pre-B-cell bioassay. In anticipation of human clinical trials, this material is currently being evaluated for safety and efficacy in non-human primate toxicology studies.	2003 Aug	Ouellette Thomas,Destrau Sophie,Ouellette Timothy,Zhu Jianwei,Roach John M,Coffman J Daniel,Hecht Toby,Lynch James E,Giardina Steven L	Protein expression and purification. 30(2) 156-66	Interleukin-7	DCDIEGKDGKQYESVLMVSIDQLLDSMKEIGSNCLNNEFNFFKRHICDANKEGMFLFRAARKLRQFLKMNSTGDFDLHLLKVSEGTTILLNCTGQVKGRKPAALGEAQPTKSLEENKSLKEQKKLNDLCFLKRLLQEIKTCWNKILMGTKEH		P13232			9	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
18950716	Purification of truncated and mutated Chemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of Staphylococcus aureus--an anti-inflammatory protein.	The Chemotaxis Inhibitory Protein of Staphylococcus aureus (CHIPS) binds and blocks the C5a receptor (C5aR) and formyl-peptide receptor (FPR). This way, CHIPS is a potent inhibitor of the immune cell recruitment associated with inflammation. Truncation of the protein and the introduction of mutations, shifts the expression towards the insoluble fraction of Escherichia coli, whereas the wild-type protein can be solubly expressed. A protocol for expression and tag independent purification of biologically active CHIPS variants has been established to enable further characterization of an improved CHIPS variant, called ADC-1004. The CHIPS variants were purified by washing of E. coli inclusion bodies followed by refolding and gel filtration. New techniques were utilized to optimize the purification process. Expression in inclusion bodies was increased by the use of Ultra Yield flasks and optimal refolding conditions were determined by the use of the iFOLD Refolding System 2. The folding and biological activity of the purified proteins were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and flow cytometry, respectively, and compared to solubly produced CHIPS(31-113) and wild-type CHIPS(1-121). We show that the CHIPS variants produced in inclusion bodies can be refolded and purified to achieve equal biological activity as solubly produced CHIPS(31-113) and wild-type CHIPS(1-121). The truncation causes minor structural changes while purification from inclusion bodies or the soluble fraction does not further affect the structure.	2009 Feb	Gustafsson Erika,Forsberg Cecilia,Haraldsson Karin,Lindman Stina,Ljung Lill,Furebring Christina	Protein expression and purification. 63(2) 95-101	Chemotaxis inhibitory protein	FEPFPTNEEIESNKKMLEKEKAYKESFKNSGLPTTLGKLDERLRNYLKKGTKNSAQFEKMVILTENKGYYTVYLNTPLAEDRK	N-terminal +C terminal hexahistidine tag	A6QIG7				22	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

18955813	Increased yield of high-purity and active tetrameric recombinant human EC-SOD by solid phase refolding.	Superoxide dismutase (SOD) removes damaging reactive oxygen species from the cellular environment by catalyzing the dismutation of two superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is a tetramer and is present in the extracellular space and to a lesser extent in the extracellular fluids. Increasing therapeutic applications for recombinant human extracellular superoxide dismutase (rEC-SOD) has broadened interest in optimizing methods for its purification, with a native conformation of tetramer. We describe a solid phase refolding procedure that combines immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and gel filtration chromatography in the purification of rEC-SOD from Escherichia coli. The purified rEC-SOD tetramer from the Ni(2+)-column chromatography is refolded in Tris buffer. This method yields greater than 900f the tetramer form. Greater than 99d0c850urity is achieved with further purification over a Superose 12PC 3.2/30 column to obtain the tetramer and specific activities as determined via DCFHDA assay. The improved yield of rEC-SOD in a simple chromatographic purification procedure promises to enhance the development and therapeutic application of this biologically potent molecule.	2008 Oct	Ryu Kang,Kim Young-Hoon,Kim Younghwa,Lee Joon-Seok,Jeon Byeongwook,Kim Tae-Yoon	Journal of microbiology and biotechnology. 18(10) 1648-54	Extracellular Superoxide Dismutase	WTGEDSAEPNSDSAEWIRDMYAKVTEIWQEVMQRRDDDGALHAACQVQPSATLDAAQPRVTGVVLFRQLAPRAKLDAFFALEGFPTEPNSSSRAIHVHQFGDLSQGCESTGPHYNPLAVPHPQHPGDFGNFAVRDGSLWRYRAGLAASLAGPHSIVGRAVVVHAGEDDLGRGGNQASVENGNAGRRLACCVVGVCGPGLWERQAREHSERKKRRRESECKAA		P08294			8	22	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
18959394	Dynamic redox environment-intensified disulfide bond shuffling for protein refolding in vitro: molecular simulation and experimental validation.	One challenge in protein refolding is to dissociate the non-native disulfide bonds and promote the formation of native ones. In this study, we present a coarse-grained off-lattice model protein containing disulfide bonds and simulate disulfide bond shuffling during the folding of this model protein. Introduction of disulfide bonds in the model protein led to enhanced conformational stability but reduced foldability in comparison to counterpart protein without disulfide bonds. The folding trajectory suggested that the model protein retained the two-step folding mechanism in terms of hydrophobic collapse and structural rearrangement. The disulfide bonds located in the hydrophobic core were formed before the collapsing step, while the bonds located on the protein surface were formed during the rearrangement step. While a reductive environment at the initial stage of folding favored the formation of native disulfide bonds in the hydrophobic core, an oxidative environment at a later stage of folding was required for the formation of disulfide bonds at protein surface. Appling a dynamic redox environment, that is, one that changes from reductive to oxidative, intensified disulfide bond shuffling and thus resulted in improved recovery of the native conformation. The above-mentioned simulation was experimentally validated by refolding hen-egg lysozyme at different urea concentrations and oxidized glutathione/reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH) ratios, and an optimal redox environment, in terms of the GSSG to GSH ratio, was identified. The implementation of a dynamic redox environment by tuning the GSSG/GSH ratio further improved the refolding yield of lysozyme, as predicted by molecular simulation.	2008 Nov	Lu Diannan,Liu Zheng	The journal of physical chemistry.

19000609	Refolding of fully reduced bovine pancreatic trypsin.	Refolding of bovine pancreatic trypsin was carried out. When starting with denatured S-S intact trypsin, the recovered activity attained was 95-100%. In contrast, the recovered activity after refolding denatured S-S reduced trypsin was considerably low compared with other proteases that have been worked with previously. Such low recovered activity was attributed to the small amount of fully reduced trypsin used as starting material for complete refolding. Taking this into account, a recovered activity of 86could be achieved when using inhibitor-immobilized gels.	2008 Oct	Ohshima Yuji,Suzuki Yusuke,Nakatani Akihiro,Nohara Daisuke	Journal of bioscience and bioengineering. 106(4) 345-9	Trypsin	IVGGYTCGANTVPYQVSLNSGYHFCGGSLINSQWVVSAAHCYKSGIQVRLGEDNINVVEGNEQFISASKSIVHPSYNSNTLNNDIMLIKLKSAASLNSRVASISLPTSCASAGTQCLISGWGNTKSSGTSYPDVLKCLKAPILSDSSCKSAYPGQITSNMFCAGYLEGGKDSCQGDSGGPVVCSGKLQGIVSWGSGCAQKNKPGVYTKVCNYVSWIKQTIASN		P00760			8.2	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
18984055	Refolding and kinetic characterization of the phosphodiesterase-8A catalytic domain.	Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase-8 (PDE8) hydrolyzes the second messenger cAMP and is involved in many biological processes such as testosterone production. Although the bacterial and mammalian expression systems have been extensively tried, production of large quantity of soluble and active PDE8 remains to be a major hurdle for pharmacological and structural studies. Reported here is a detailed protocol of refolding and purification of large quantity of the PDE8A1 catalytic domain (residues 480-820) and kinetic characterization of the refolded protein. This protocol yielded about 8 mg of the PDE8A catalytic domain from 2l Escherichia coli culture, which has at least 40-fold higher activity than those reported in literature. The PDE8A1 catalytic domain has k(cat) of 4.0 s(-1) for Mn(2+) and 2.9s(-1) for Mg(2+), and the K(M) values of 1-1.8 microM. In addition, the PDE8A1 (205-820) fragment that contains both PAS and catalytic domains was expressed in E. coli and refolded. This PDE8A1 (205-820) fragment has k(cat) of 1.1 s(-1) and K(M) of 0.28 microM, but aggregated at high concentration. The K(M) of PDE8A1 (205-820) is 2- to 7-fold higher than the K(M) values of 40-150 nM for the full-length PDE8s in literature, but about 6-fold lower than that of the catalytic domain. Thus, the K(M) difference likely implies an allosteric regulation of the PDE8A activity by its PAS domain.	2009 Mar	Yan Zier,Wang Huanchen,Cai Jiwen,Ke Hengming	Protein expression and purification. 64(1) 82-8	 CAMP-specific cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase PDE8A1	LDDVPPRIARAMENEEYWDFDIFELEAATHNRPLIYLGLKMFARFGICEFLHCSESTLRSWLQIIEANYHSSNPYHNSTHSADVLHATAYFLSKERIKETLDPIDEVAALIAATIHDVDHPGRTNSFLCNAGSELAILYNDTAVLESHHAALAFQLTTGDDKCNIFKNMERNDYRTLRQGIIDMVLATEMTKHFEHVNKFVNSINKPLATLEENGETDKNQEVINTMLRTPENRTLIKRMLIKCADVSNPCRPLQYCIEWAARISEEYFSQTDEEKQQGLPVVMPVFDRNTCSIPKSQISFIDYFITDMFDAWDAFVDLPDLMQHLDNNFKYWKGLDEMK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q96T71		catalytic domain (residues 480窶・20)	7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

11388810	Systematic optimization of expression and refolding of the Plasmodium falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2.	The Plasmodium falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2 is a potential new target for antimalarial chemotherapy. In order to obtain large quantities of active falcipain-2 for biochemical and structural analysis, a systematic assessment of optimal parameters for the expression and refolding of the protease was carried out. High-yield expression was achieved using M15(pREP4) Escherichia coli transformed with the pQE-30 plasmid containing a truncated profalcipain-2 construct. Recombinant falcipain-2 was expressed as inclusion bodies, solubilized, and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. A systematic approach was then used to optimize refolding parameters. This approach utilized 100-fold dilutions of reduced and denatured falcipain-2 into 203 different buffers in a microtiter plate format. Refolding efficiency varied markedly. Optimal refolding was obtained in an alkaline buffer containing glycerol or sucrose and equal concentrations of reduced and oxidized glutathione. After optimization of the expression and refolding protocols and additional purification with anion-exchange chromatography, 12 mg of falcipain-2 was obtained from 5 liters of E. coli, and crystals of the protease were grown. The systematic approach described here allowed the rapid evaluation of a large number of expression and refolding conditions and provided milligram quantities of recombinant falcipain-2.	2001 Jun	Sijwali P S,Brinen L S,Rosenthal P J	Protein expression and purification. 22(1) 128-34	Cysteine protease falcipain-2	MDYNMDYAPHEVISHQGERFVDKYVDRKILKNKKSLLVIISLSVLSVVGFILFYFTPNFRKSDLFKNSSVENNNDDYIINSLLKSPNGKKFIVSKIDEALSFYDSKKNDINKYNEGNNNNNADFKGLSLFKENTPSNNFIHNKDYFINFFDNKFLMNNAEHINQFYMFIKTNNKQYNSPNEMKERFQVFLQNAHKVNMHNNNKNSLYKKELNRFADLTYHEFKNKYLSLRSSKPLKNSKYLLDQMNYEEVIKKYRGEENFDHAAYDWRLHSGVTPVKDQKNCGSCWAFSSIGSVESQYAIRKNKLITLSEQELVDCSFKNYGCNGGLINNAFEDMIELGGICPDGDYPYVSDAPNLCNIDRCTEKYGIKNYLSVPDNKLKEALRFLGPISISVAVSDDFAFYKEGIFDGECGDELNHAVMLVGFGMKEIVNPLTKKGEKHYYYIIKNSWGQQWGERGFINIETDESGLMRKCGLGTDAFIPLIE		Q9NBD4			9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18824107	Expression and functional characterization of the plant antimicrobial snakin-1 and defensin recombinant proteins.	In this study, for the first time, functionally active, recombinant, cysteine-rich plant proteins snakin-1 (SN1) and defensin (PTH1) were expressed and purified using a prokaryotic expression system. The overall level of antimicrobial activities of SN1 and PTH1 produced in Escherichia coli was commensurate with that of the same proteins previously obtained from plant tissues. Both proteins exhibited strong antibacterial activity against the phytopathogenic bacterium Clavibacter michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus (50 0nhibitory concentration (IC(50)) 1.5-8 microM) and antifungal activity against the phytopathogenic fungi Colletotrichum coccoides and Botrytis cinerea (IC(50) 5-14 microM). Significantly weaker activity was observed against Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tabaci. A pronounced synergistic antimicrobial effect against P. syringae pv. syringae and an additive effect against P. syringae pv. tabaci occurred with a combination of SN1 and PTH1. Aggregation of C. michiganensis subsp. sepedonicus bacterial cells at all protein concentrations tested was observed with the combination of SN1 and PTH1 and with SN1 alone. Our results demonstrate the use of a cost effective prokaryotic expression system for generation and in vitro characterization of plant cysteine-rich proteins with potential antimicrobial activities against a wide range of phytopathogenic microorganisms in order to select the most effective agents for future in vivo studies.	2009 Jan	Kovalskaya Natalia,Hammond Rosemarie W	Protein expression and purification. 63(1) 12-7	Snakin-1	GSSFCDSKCKLRCSKAGLADRCLKYCGICCEECKCVPSGTYGNKHECPCYRDKKNSKGKSKCP	C-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q948Z4			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
18824105	Purification, refolding and autoactivation of the recombinant cysteine proteinase EhCP112 from Entamoeba histolytica.	The cysteine proteinase EhCP112 and the adhesin EhADH112 assemble to form the EhCPADH complex involved in Entamoeba histolytica virulence. To further characterize this cysteine proteinase, the recombinant full-length EhCP112 enzyme was expressed and purified under denaturing conditions. After a refolding step under reductive conditions, the inactive precursor (ppEhCP112) was processed to a 35.5 kDa mature and active enzyme (EhCP112). The thiol specific inhibitor E-64, but not serine or aspartic proteinase inhibitors arrested this activation process. The activation step of the proenzyme followed by the mature enzyme suggests an autocatalytic process during EhCP112 maturation. The experimentally determined processing sites observed during EhCP112 activation lie close to processing sites of other cysteine proteinases from parasites. The kinetic parameters of the mature EhCP112 were determined using hemoglobin and azocasein as substrates. The proteinase activity of EhCP112 was completely inhibited by thiol inhibitors, E-64, TLCK, and chymostatin, but not by general proteinase inhibitors. Since EhCP112 is a proteinase involved in the virulence of E. histolytica, a reliable source of active EhCP112 is a key step for its biochemical characterization and to carry out future protein structure-function studies.	2009 Jan	Quintas-Granados Laura I,Orozco Esther,Brieba Luis G,Arroyo Rossana,Ortega-López Jaime	Protein expression and purification. 63(1) 26-32	Cysteine proteinase	MTAIVVAFLLLVSNQKTQSIAFNLELPVDKLFIQFKTKYNKHYSLTEEQFRFQIFKNNLKNIKTLNEKRTQPSDAFHDINMYTDLIDEELPISKGMAIPVSSYDNEHFNSKELKKVEKPWNEVPPLPSGDNLPQNYAFCGEYVSKNTDRPKVDLCGEVFSQQNCGGCWAVSLANLAQYLYSNLTYQRYGCIKTPPKFSAQRFLDVTKTKATKRLLWWSSSRRCLIAVKSFSLDADYPFVDGPNKNVCTIRGDQNPNVQIQMAITGYKTFGISKDQNMVLLLKKLLHHYGPFLVSVKVSGTGFSSYSSGIFSFPSSSICDTSSSSFMTDHEVVLMDGYRECVEYFIIRNSWASGWGEGDNYIRIKTTNLCGIGWRIGDYVYPLNMIVYANTCKLDKYCSSCNISSNICSSCVSGYYLNSNNKCVKNTAKLVKYHSNSTYVQFYNHTI		Q9U7F7			8	25	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
18718539	High-yield expression in E. coli and refolding of the bZIP domain of activating transcription factor 5.	Activating transcription factor 5 (ATF5) recently has been demonstrated to play a critical role in promoting the survival of human glioblastoma cells. Interference with the function of ATF5 in an in vivo rat model caused glioma cell death in primary tumors but did not affect the status of normal cells surrounding the tumor, suggesting ATF5 may prove an ideal target for anti-cancer therapy. In order to examine ATF5 as a pharmaceutical target, the protein must be produced and purified to sufficient quantity to begin analyses. Here, a procedure for expressing and refolding the bZIP domain of ATF5 in sufficient yield and final concentration to permit assay development and structural characterization of this target using solution NMR is reported. Two-dimensional NMR and circular dichroism analyses indicate the protein exists in the partially alpha-helical, monomeric x-form conformation with only a small fraction of ATF5 participating in formation of higher-order structure, presumably coiled-coil homodimerization. Despite the persistence of monomers in solution even at high concentration, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that ATF5 is able to bind to the cAMP response element (CRE) DNA motif. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry were used to confirm that ATF5 can participate in homodimer formation and that this dimerization is mediated by disulfide bond formation.	2008 Dec	Ciaccio Natalie A,Moreno Matthew L,Bauer Rachel L,Laurence Jennifer S	Protein expression and purification. 62(2) 235-43	Activating transcription factor 5	LEGECQGLEARNREL	N-terminal GST	Q9Y2D1		bZIP domain	6.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f
10636850	Refolded outer membrane protein A of Escherichia coli forms ion channels with two conductance states in planar lipid bilayers.	Outer membrane protein A (OmpA), a major structural protein of the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, consists of an N-terminal 8-stranded beta-barrel transmembrane domain and a C-terminal periplasmic domain. OmpA has served as an excellent model for studying the mechanism of insertion, folding, and assembly of constitutive integral membrane proteins in vivo and in vitro. The function of OmpA is currently not well understood. Particularly, the question whether or not OmpA forms an ion channel and/or nonspecific pore for uncharged larger solutes, as some other porins do, has been controversial. We have incorporated detergent-purified OmpA into planar lipid bilayers and studied its permeability to ions by single channel conductance measurements. In 1 M KCl, OmpA formed small (50-80 pS) and large (260-320 pS) channels. These two conductance states were interconvertible, presumably corresponding to two different conformations of OmpA in the membrane. The smaller channels are associated with the N-terminal transmembrane domain, whereas both domains are required to form the larger channels. The two channel activities provide a new functional assay for the refolding in vitro of the two respective domains of OmpA. Wild-type and five single tryptophan mutants of urea-denatured OmpA are shown to refold into functional channels in lipid bilayers.	2000 Jan	Arora A,Rinehart D,Szabo G,Tamm L K	The Journal of biological chemistry. 275(3) 1594-600	Outer membrane protein A	APKDNTWYTGAKLGWSQYHDTGFINNNGPTHENQLGAGAFGGYQVNPYVGFEMGYDWLGRMPYKGSVENGAYKAQGVQLTAKLGYPITDDLDIYTRLGGMVWRADTKSNVYGKNHDTGVSPVFAGGVEYAITPEIATRLEYQWTNNIGDAHTIGTRPDNGMLSLGVSYRFGQGEAAPVVAPAPAPAPEVQTKHFTLKSDVLFNFNKATLKPEGQAALDQLYSQLSNLDPKDGSVVVLGYTDRIGSDAYNQGLSERRAQSVVDYLISKGIPADKISARGMGESNPVTGNTCDNVKQRAALIDCLAPDRRVEIEVKGIKDVVTQPQA		P0A910			10	40	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19065263	Production and initial characterization of Dad1p, a component of the Dam1-DASH kinetochore complex.	In all dividing eukaryotic cells, the mitotic spindle (composed primarily of microtubules) must interact with chromosomes through a complex protein assembly called the kinetochore. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Dam1-DASH complex plays an important role in promoting attachment between the kinetochore and the mitotic spindle. It also actively participates in the physical separation of sister chromatids in anaphase. Understanding the biochemical mechanisms used by Dam1-DASH has been facilitated by bacterial co-expression of the ten Dam1-DASH genes, which results in the production of a heterodecameric protein complex that can be studied in vitro. However, individual protein subunits are not soluble when expressed in E. coli, thus precluding analysis of the nature of the interaction between subunits and an examination of the assembly of the functional complex. In this paper, we describe the expression, solubilization, purification and refolding of Dad1p, one of the Dam1-DASH complex subunits. In addition, we show that Dad1p, when isolated in this manner forms dimers and/or tetramers, dependent upon protein concentration. This work provides an important tool for studying the Dam1-DASH complex that was previously unavailable, and provides an avenue of investigation for understanding how the individual heterodecamers associate with each other to facilitate chromosome segregation.	2008 	Waldo Jennifer,Scherrer Michael	PloS one. 3(12) e3888	DASH complex subunit DAD1	MMASTSNDEEKLISTTDKYFIEQRNIVLQEINETMNSILNGLNGLNISLESSIAVGREFQSVSDLWKTLYDGLESLSDEAPIDEQPTLSQSKTK	N-terminal hexahistidine tag	Q12248			7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

19056467	DNA and heparin chaperone the refolding of purified recombinant replication protein A subunit 1 from Leishmania amazonensis.	Replication protein A (RPA) is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that has been implicated in DNA metabolism and telomere maintenance. Subunit 1 of RPA from Leishmania amazonensis (LaRPA-1) has previously been affinity-purified on a column containing a G-rich telomeric DNA. LaRPA-1 binds and co-localizes with parasite telomeres in vivo. Here we describe the purification and characterization of native recombinant LaRPA-1 (rLaRPA-1). The protein was initially re-solubilized from inclusion bodies by using urea. After dialysis, rLaRPA-1 was soluble but contaminated with DNA, which was removed by an anion-exchange chromatography of the protein solubilized in urea. However, rLaRPA-1 precipitated after dialysis to remove urea. To investigate whether the contaminating DNA was involved in chaperoning the refolding of rLaRPA-1, salmon sperm DNA or heparin was added to the solution before dialysis. The addition of either of these substances prevented the precipitation of rLaRPA-1. The resulting rLaRPA-1 was soluble, correctly folded, and able to bind telomeric DNA. This is the first report showing the characterization of rLaRPA1 and of the importance of additives in chaperoning the refolding of this protein. The availability of rLaRPA-1 should be helpful in assessing the importance of this protein as a potential drug target.	2009 Jan	Lira C B B,Gui K E,Perez A M,da Silveira R C V,Gava L M,Ramos C H I,Cano M I N	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1790(2) 119-25	Replication protein A subunit 1	MQQPGSHQIQPIDSLTPFLGGKWWIRARVTDKTDVRTWNKPTSQGKLFSFTLIDESAAIRATVFNDAVDTFEPLIVNGQVYYFSGGQVKNANRRFSNVNNDYELTFDRSSEIMLARQDTSTAALPMQRYNFVPIELLKQREVGSLVDVLGVVLKVDEVSSITQKSTGRELVKRNVKMGDMTAAVEVTFWNDEAKAWCYPVGTVVALRQLKVGSFHGVPFSSTYQTKIDINPTDLPDVKKLATWYVTTGGANVMSLSSQGLGAASGAGGESDRGRKYLDEIQSDGIGRGLKPEYVDVRCVPIYFKQDAQWYDACPTCNKKVTEEGAQGDRFRCEKCDKTVTPTQRYLVSIQVTDNVSQAWLTLFNEAGIEFFGMEAAELKRRAQEDPLYIAKLAQGRMNRPVVMRLRVKEETSSNAMTGEESDRLRMSVVRISEFMPIAGTSEETRRRLAQNLRTECDEILRLIEAYV	N-terminal His6 tag	Q5MY89	DNA binding		7.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
19091155	Cryptopain-1, a cysteine protease of Cryptosporidium parvum, does not require the pro-domain for folding.	Cryptosporidium parvum is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes cryptosporidiosis in mammals including humans. In the current study, the gene encoding the cysteine protease of C. parvum (cryptopain-1) was identified and the biochemical properties of the recombinant enzyme were characterized. Cryptopain-1 shared common structural properties with cathepsin L-like papain family enzymes, but lacked a typical signal peptide sequence and contained a possible transmembrane domain near the amino terminus and a unique insert in the front of the mature domain. The recombinant cryptopain-1 expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded to the active form showed typical biochemical properties of cathepsin L-like enzymes. The folding determinant of cryptopain-1 was characterized through multiple constructs with or without different lengths of the pro-domain of the enzyme expressed in E. coli and assessment of their refolding abilities. All constructs, except one that did not contain the full-length mature domain, successfully refolded into the active enzymes, suggesting that cryptopain-1 did not require the pro-domain for folding. Western blot analysis showed that cryptopain-1 was expressed in the sporozoites and the enzyme preferentially degraded proteins, including collagen and fibronectin, but not globular proteins. This suggested a probable role for cryptopain-1 in host cell invasion and/or egression by the parasite.	2009 Jan	Na B-K,Kang J-M,Cheun H-I,Cho S-H,Moon S-U,Kim T-S,Sohn W-M	Parasitology. 136(2) 149-57	Cryptopain-1	MDIGNNVEEHQEYISGPYIALINGTNQQREPNKKLKNIIIATLIAIFIVLVVTVSLYITNNTSDKIDDFVPGDYVDPATREYRKSFEEFKKKYHKVYSSMEEENQRFEIYKQNMNFIKTTNSQGFSYVLEMNEFGDLSKEEFMARFTGYIKDSKDDERVFKSSRVSASESEEEFVPPNSINWVEAGCVNPIRNQKNCGSCWAFSAVAALEGATCAQTNRGLPSLSEQQFVDCSKQNGNFGCDGGTMGLAFQYAIKNKYLCTNDDYPYFAEEKTCMDSFCENYIEIPVKAYKYVFPRNINALKTALAKYGPISVAIQADQTPFQFYKSGVFDAPCGTKVNHGVVLVGYDMDEDTNKEYWLVRNSWGEAWGEKGYIKLALHSGKKGTCGILVEPVYPVINQSI	N-terminal His6 tag	Q7YZ24	cysteine-type peptidase		8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19152836	Expression, purification and characterization of aprotinin and a human analogue of aprotinin.	Aprotinin is a Kunitz-type inhibitor with a relatively broad specificity. It has been shown to be clinically useful for the management of hemorrhagic complications. In this report, small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) linked with a hexa-histidine tag was used as a fusion partner for the production of recombinant aprotinin and a human aprotinin analogue (cloned form human cDNA library). Both fusion proteins were overexpressed mainly as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and accounted for approximately 280f the total cell proteins. After purification by Ni-Sepharose affinity chromatography and renaturation, the fusion proteins were cleaved with SUMO protease 1. Aprotinin and its analogue were separated from the fusion partner by the subtractive chromatography using Ni-Sepharose and then further purified with CM-cellulose. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the amidolytic activity of plasmin was competitively inhibited by recombinant aprotinin with a K(i) of 8.6+/-2.4 nM, which was similar to the K(i) (7.5+/-2.7 nM) of natural aprotinin. The K(i) of human aprotinin analogue was 22.7+/-6.5 nM. The expression strategy described in this study allows convenient high yield and easy purification of small recombinant protease inhibitors with complete native sequences.	2009 Mar	Sun Ziyong,Lu Wei,Jiang Aiqing,Chen Junyong,Tang Fengyuan,Liu Jian-Ning	Protein expression and purification. 65(2) 238-43	aprotinin	RPDFCLEPPYTGPCKARIIRYFYNAKAGLCQTFVYGGCRAKRNNFKSAEDCMRTCGGA	N-terminal His6 tag, N-terminal SUMO tag	P00974	serine protease inhibitor		8.5	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

19152967	A hypoallergenic variant of Der p 1 as a candidate for mite allergy vaccines.	BACKGROUND:Recombinant hypoallergens that display reduced allergenicity but retain T-cell reactivity represent promising candidates to improve the safety and efficacy of allergen-specific vaccines or immunotherapy.OBJECTIVE:The current study reports the immunologic characterization of a hypoallergenic variant of the major mite allergen Der p 1.METHODS:The recombinant proform of Der p 1 (ProDer p 1) was expressed in Escherichia coli (ProDer p 1 coli), purified and characterized at the level of its secondary structure, and IgE and T-cell reactivities. Moreover, the prophylactic potential of ProDer p 1 coli vaccinations was evaluated in a murine Der p 1 sensitization model.RESULTS:After purification and refolding, ProDer p 1 coli remained aggregated with a higher beta-sheet content and altered Der p 1 conformational epitopes compared with the correctly folded monomeric ProDer p 1 produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both ProDer p 1 forms were able to retain the Der p 1-specific T-cell reactivity but direct ELISA, competitive inhibition, and rat basophil leukemia assays clearly showed that ProDer p 1 coli displays a very weak IgE reactivity. Mice vaccinations with aggregated ProDer p 1 adjuvanted with alum induced a T(H)1-biased immune response that prevented the subsequent allergic response after Der p 1 sensitization and airway challenge with aerosolized mite extracts. Furthermore, ProDer p 1 coli treatment inhibited the development of airway eosinophilia and airway hyperresponsiveness to inhaled methacholine.CONCLUSION:Aggregated forms of Der p 1 could represent hypoallergens suitable for the prevention of mite allergy.	2009 May	Walgraffe David,Mattéotti Christel,El Bakkoury Mohamed,Garcia Lida,Marchand Céline,Bullens Dominique,Vandenbranden Michel,Jacquet Alain	The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology. 123(5) 1150-6	Der p 1	RPSSIKTFEEYKKAFNKSYATFEDEEAARKNFLESVKYVQSNGGAINHLSDLSLDEFKNRFLMSAEAFEHLKTQFDLNAETNACSINGNAPAEIDLRQMRTVTPIRMQGGCGSCWAFSGVAATESAYLAYRNQSLDLAEQELVDCASQHGCHGDTIPRGIEYIQHNGVVQESYYRYVAREQSCRRPNAQRFGISNYCQIYPPNVNKIREALAQTHSAIAVIIGIKDLDAFRHYDGRTIIQRDNGYQPNYHAVNIVGYSNAQGVDYWIVRNSWDTNWGDNGYGYFAANIDLMMIEEYPYVVIL	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag	P08176	thiol protease		7.4		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
19184382	Efficient production of bioactive recombinant human Flt3 ligand in E. coli.	Flt3 ligand (FL) is an early-acting hematopoietic cytokine that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells by activating its cognate receptor, Flt3. Recently, FL was shown to potently contribute to the development and expansion of antigen-presenting dendritic cells and CD34(+) natural killer cell progenitors in vivo. Here, we report a comprehensive method for the production of bioactive recombinant human FL (rhFL) in E. coli, suitable for structural, biophysical and physiological studies. A soluble form of human FL capable of binding to the Ftl3 receptor could be overexpressed in the E. coli strain Rosetta-gami(DE3) as inclusion bodies. We have established protocols for the efficient in vitro refolding and ensuing purification of rhFL to homogeneity (&gt;95%), with yields approaching 5 mg of pure rhFL per liter of culture. The ability of rhFL to adopt a bioactive conformation was confirmed via a cell-proliferation assay and the activation of the Flt3 receptor in the human leukemic cell line, OCI-AML3.	2009 Mar	Verstraete Kenneth,Koch Sina,Ertugrul Sevgi,Vandenberghe Isabel,Aerts Maarten,Vandriessche Gonzalez,Thiede Christian,Savvides Savvas N	The protein journal. 28(2) 57-65	Flt3 ligand	TQDCSFQHSPISSDFAVKIRELSDYLLQDYPVTVASNLQDEELCGGLWRLVLAQRWMERLKTVAGSKMQGLLERVNTEIHFVTKCAFQPPPSCLRFVQTNISRLLQETSEQLVALKPWITRQNFSRCLELQCQP	N-terminal His6 tag, 27-160aa	P49771	cytokine		8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
19224588	Refolding of lactate dehydrogenase by zeolite beta.	We used zeolite beta as an adsorbing matrix to refold recombinant lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) protein collected as an insoluble aggregate from a bacterial expression system. The adsorption isotherm revealed that 1 g of zeolite adsorbed 200 mg of denatured LDH solubilized with a buffer containing 6 M of guanidine hydrochloride. The pH of the buffer had little effect on the adsorption, but this property was abolished by preincubation of the zeolite with polyethylene glycol (PEG) in a weight ratio of 1:10. These data suggest that the adsorption of LDH depends on the hydrophobicity of the zeolite surface, and that the adsorption of PEG to zeolite is sufficient to release LDH from its surface. LDH was thus released by refolding buffer containing PEG and arginine, and soluble LDH was obtained in its active enzymatic form. The addition of arginine dramatically increased the yield of LDH in a dose-dependent manner. The overall refolding efficiency was optimized to 35%.	2009 Feb	Togashi Hideaki,Nara Takayuki,Sekikawa Chisato,Kawakami Masayuki,Yaginuma Nakatsugu,Tsunoda Tatsuo,Sakaguchi Kengo,Mizukami Fujio	Biotechnology progress. 25(1) 200-6	lactate dehydrogenase	MSSMPNHQKVVLVGDGAVGSSYAFAMAQQGIAEEFVIVDVVKDRTKGDALDLEDAQAFTAPKKIYSGEYSDCKDADLVVITAGAPQKPGESRLDLVNKNLNILSSIVKPVVDSGFDGIFLVAANPVDILTYATWKFSGFPKDRVIGSGTSLDSSRLRVALGKQFNVDPRSVDAYIMGEHGDSEFAAYSTATIGTRPVRDVAKEQGVSDEDLAKLEDGVRNKAYDIINLKGATFYGIGTALMRISKAILRDENAVLPVGAYMDGQYGLNDIYIGTPAVIGGTGLKQIIESPLSADELKKMQDSAATLKKVLNDGLAELENK	N-terminal His6 tag	P56512	oxidoreductase		5.5	room temperature	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
19235265	Expression and purification of bioactive high-purity human midkine in Escherichia coli.	Midkine is a heparin-binding growth factor, which plays important roles in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The non-tagged recombinant human midkine (rhMK) is therefore required to facilitate its functional studies of this important growth factor. In the present work, rhMK was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3). The expression of midkine was efficiently induced by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). After sonication, midkine was recovered in an insoluble form, and was dissolved in guanidine hydrochloride buffer. Renaturation of the denatured protein was carried out in the defined protein refolding buffer, and the refolded protein was purified using S-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography. The final preparation of the rhMK was greater than 981fb7850ure as measured by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamid gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The purified rhMK enhanced the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells.	2009 Feb	Zhang Zhong-hui,Du Li-juan,Xiang Di,Zhu Shun-ying,Wu Ming-yuan,Lu Hui-li,Yu Yan,Han Wei	Journal of Zhejiang University. Science.

Expression of the protein with or without signal peptide was investigated in E. coli strains TOP10 and LMG194. Different PCR products were amplified for expression of the native target protein or a protein with a signal peptide. Omitting the native stop codon and adding six His-residues resulted in a fusion protein amenable to immune detection and purification by immobilised metal affinity chromatography. In E. coli the recombinant protein was produced in high yield as insoluble inclusion bodies. The influence of different parameters on MsP2 refolding was investigated. Active enzyme was obtained by glutathione-mediated oxidation in a medium containing urea, Ca(2+), and hemin.	2009 Apr	Zelena Kateryna,Zorn Holger,Nimtz Manfred,Berger Ralf Günter	Archives of microbiology. 191(5) 397-402	MsP2	ASVGLNLTDIQGDILIGMKKNKEMFFFFSIADATAFKSHLDSAILPLITSTQQLLTVATQPTTAVNLAFSQTGLNALGLASQGLGDSLFASGQFSGAESLGDPGTSNWVQAFAGTGIHGVFLLASDTIDNVNAELSQIQSILGTSITEAYRLQGEARPDDQQGHEHFGFMDGISNPAIDGFSTALPGQAVLSPGLFLLAEDGDGSSSSRPSWAKDGSLLAFRQLQQRVPEFNKFLADNAALTQGNADLLGARMMGRWKSGAPVDLAPTADDVDLANDPQRNNNFNFTHPDFTETTDQTHCPFSAHIRKTNPRSDFNPLNTANHIIRAGIPYGPEVTDAEASSNTSSTDASLERGLAFVAYQSNIGNGFAFIQQNWVDNANFFFGKTTPPGIDPIIGSNAAQNNFAPNSPRPVSGLDPTDSTTIVTLNTDFVVSRGGEYFFSPSLSAIQNTLSV	C-terminal His6 tag, 58-510 aa, without signal peptide and propeptide	B0BK72	Peroxidase		9.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

19264131	Clinical grade production and characterization of a fusion protein comprised of the chemokine CCL2-ligand genetically fused to a mutated and truncated form of the Shiga A1 subunit.	First generation chemokine ligand-Shiga A1 (SA1) fusion proteins (leukocyte population modulators, LPMs) were previously only obtained in small quantities due to the ribosomal inactivating protein properties of the SA1 moiety which inhibits protein synthesis in host cells. We therefore employed 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4-d]-pyrimidine, an inhibitor of Shiga A1, to allow the growth of these cells prior to induction and during the expression phase post-induction with IPTG. Scale-up allowed the production of gram quantities of clinical grade material of the lead candidate, OPL-CCL2-LPM. A manufacturing cell bank was established and used to produce OPL-CCL2-LPM in a fed-batch fermentation process. Induction of the expression of OPL-CCL2-LPM led to the production of 22.47 mg/L per OD(600) unit. The LPM was purified from inclusion bodies using solubilization, renaturation, refolding and chromatography steps. The identity and purity of the OPL-CCL2-LPM was determined using several analytical techniques. The product retained the ability of the SA1 moiety to inhibit protein synthesis as measured in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate cell-free protein synthesis assay and was cytotoxic to target cells. Binding studies established that the protein exerts its effects via CCR2, the cognate receptor for CCL2.

19271776	Recombinant plasmepsin 1 from the human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum: enzymatic characterization, active site inhibitor design, and structural analysis.	A mutated form of truncated proplasmepsin 1 (proPfPM1) from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, proPfPM1 K110pN, was generated and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The automaturation process was carried out at pH 4.0 and 4.5, and the optimal catalytic pH of the resulting mature PfPM1 was determined to be pH 5.5. This mature PfPM1 showed comparable binding affinity to peptide substrates and inhibitors with the naturally occurring form isolated from parasites. The S3-S3&#39; subsite preferences of the recombinant mature PfPM1 were explored using combinatorial chemistry based peptide libraries. On the basis of the results, a peptidomimetic inhibitor (compound 1) was designed and yielded 5-fold selectivity for binding to PfPM1 versus the homologous human cathepsin D (hcatD). The 2.8 A structure of the PfPM2-compound 1 complex is reported. Modeling studies were conducted using a series of peptidomimetic inhibitors (compounds 1-6, Table 3) and three plasmepsins: the crystal structure of PfPM2, and homology derived models of PfPM1 and PfPM4.	2009 May	Liu Peng,Marzahn Melissa R,Robbins Arthur H,Gutiérrez-de-Terán Hugo,Rodríguez David,McClung Scott H,Stevens Stanley M,Yowell Charles A,Dame John B,McKenna Robert,Dunn Ben M	Biochemistry. 48(19) 4086-99	Plasmepsin 1	SKHVIIGFSIENSHDRIMKTVKQHRLKNYIKESLNFFKTGLTQKPHLGNAGDSVTLNDVANVMYYGEAQIGDNKQKFAFIFDTGSANLWVPSAQCNTIGCKTKNLYDSNKSKTYEKDGTKVEMNYVSGTVSGFFSKDIVTIANLSFPYKFIEVTDTNGFEPAYTLGQFDGIVGLGWKDLSIGSVDPVVVELKNQNKIEQAVFTFYLPFDDKHKGYLTIGGIEDRFYEGQLTYEKLNHDLYWQVDLDLHFGNLTVEKATAIVDSGTSSITAPTEFLNKFFEGLDVVKIPFLPLYITTCNNPKLPTLEFRSATNVYTLEPEYYLQQIFDFGISLCMVSIIPVDLNKNTFILGDPFMRKYFTVFDYDNHTVGFALAKKKL	76-452 aa (truncated prosegment plus the mature enzyme), K110N mutant	P39898	aspartic-type endopeptidase		8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
19272620	Production and recovery of recombinant propapain with high yield.	Papain (EC 3.4.22.2), the archetypal cysteine protease of C1 family, is of considerable commercial significance. In order to obtain substantial quantities of active papain, the DNA coding for propapain, the papain precursor, has been cloned and expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with two T7 promoter based pET expression vectors - pET30 Ek/LIC and pET28a(+) each containing the propapain gene. In both cases, recombinant propapain was expressed as an insoluble His-tagged fusion protein, which was solubilized, and purified by nickel chelation affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. By systematic variation of parameters influencing the folding, disulfide bond formation and prevention of aggregate formation, a straightforward refolding procedure, based on dilution method, has been designed. This refolded protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography to remove impurities and around 400mg of properly refolded propapain was obtained from 1L of bacterial culture. The expressed protein was further verified by Western blot analysis by cross-reacting it with a polyclonal anti-papain antibody and the proteolytic activity was confirmed by gelatin SDS-PAGE. This refolded propapain could be converted to mature active papain by autocatalytic processing at low pH and the recombinant papain so obtained has a specific activity closely similar to the native papain. This is a simple and efficient expression and purification procedure to obtain a yield of active papain, which is the highest reported so far for any recombinant plant cysteine protease.	2009 Mar	Choudhury Debi,Roy Sumana,Chakrabarti Chandana,Biswas Sampa,Dattagupta J K	Phytochemistry. 70(4) 465-72	propapain	DFSIVGYSQNDLTSTERLIQLFESWMLKHNKIYKNIDEKIYRFEIFKDNLKYIDETNKKNNSYWLGLNVFADMSNDEFKEKYTGSIAGNYTTTELSYEEVLNDGDVNIPEYVDWRQKGAVTPVKNQGSCGSCWAFSAVVTIEGIIKIRTGNLNEYSEQELLDCDRRSYGCNGGYPWSALQLVAQYGIHYRNTYPYEGVQRYCRSREKGPYAAKTDGVRQVQPYNEGALLYSIANQPVSVVLEAAGKDFQLYRGGIFVGPCGNKVDHAVAAVGYGPNYILIKNSWGTGWGENGYIRIKRGTGNSYGVCGLYTSSFYPVKN	27-345 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	P00784	cysteine-type peptidase		8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f

In this study, we report the simultaneous refolding and reconstitution of the recombinant Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli. A functional assay showed that the resulting proteoliposomes responded to acidic conditions and triggered the release of entrapped Ca(2+) from liposomes. The secondary structure of the reconstituted BI-1 was also determined using circular dichroism, which revealed an increase of alpha-helix content and a decrease of random structure when exposed to acidic solutions. These conformational changes may be responsible for the proton ion-induced Ca(2+) release of BI-1.	2009 Apr	Ahn Taeho,Yun Chul-Ho,Chae Ho Zoon,Kim Hyung-Ryong,Chae Han-Jung	Protein expression and purification. 66(1) 35-8	Bax inhibitor-1	MNIFDRKINFDALLKFSHITPSTQQHLKKVYASFALCMFVAAAGAYVHMVTHFIQAGLLSALGSLILMIWLMATPHSHETEQKRLGLLAGFAFLTGVGLGPALEFCIAVNPSILPTAFMGTAMIFTCFTLSALYARRRSYLFLGGILMSALSLLLLSSLGNVFFGSIWLFQANLYVGLVVMCGFVLFDTQLIIEKAEHGDQDYIWHCIDLFLDFITVFRKLMMILAMNEKDKKKEKK		P55061	endoribonuclease inhibitor	full length	7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
19306078	High-level expression, purification, and in vitro refolding of soluble tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL).	Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a new member of the TNF superfamily. In this paper, we report the expression, purification, and preparation of a recombinant form of the extracelluar domain of the TRAIL (sTRAIL) without posttranslational modifications, which may selectively induce apoptosis of tumor cells in vitro. To obtain recombinant nonfusion sTRAIL protein, the encoding region for sTRAIL was cloned between KpnI and BamHI in pET32a. The Trx (thioredoxin)/sTRAIL fusion proteins were expressed in the form of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli host strain BL21 (DE3). The expression level was more than 350f total cell lysate. Inclusion bodies were disrupted, washed, and isolated at pH 9.0, and were completely dissolved in a buffer containing 2 M urea at pH 9.0. After nickel ion metal affinity chromatography, gel filtration chromatography, and renaturation, the refolded fusion proteins with a purity of &gt;98% were obtained. Trx/sTRAIL L proteins were digested by enterokinase to both Trx and sTRAIL fragments, which then were separated by cation exchange chromatography. Cell proliferation experiments proved that the rsTRAIL (981fb7850urity) retains its cancer-selective apoptosis-inducing properties. This result suggested that the recombinant sTRAIL may have cancer therapeutic applications.	2009 Mar	Wang Dongming,Shi Linmei	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 157(1) 1-9	Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand	ERGPQ RVAAHITGTR GRSNTLSSPN SKNEKALGRK INSWESSRSG HSFLSNLHLR NGELVIHEKG FYYIYSQTYF RFQEEIKENT KNDKQMVQYI YKYTSYPDPI LLMKSARNSC WSKDAEYGLY SIYQGGIFEL KENDRIFVSV TNEHLIDMDH EASFFGAFLV G	N-terminal Trx and His6tag,  116-281 aa	P50591	Cytokine	extracelluar domain	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19308452	Molecular cloning and analysis of stage and tissue-specific expression of Cathepsin L-like protease from Clonorchis sinensis.	Cathepsin L of parasite plays multiple roles in growth, food uptake, and invasion into host and pathogenesis, which makes it a valuable target for diagnosis, vaccine, and drug. In this study, we identified a cDNA encoding cathepsin L homolog (CsCPL) from the library of Clonorchis sinensis adult by bioinformatics analysis. Sequence encoding proenzyme of CsCPL (removal of signal peptide, CsproCPL) was highly expressed in form of inclusion body in Escherichia coli, and soluble rCsproCPL (about 1 mg/ml) in high purity were obtained after denaturation, purification, and renaturation. Western blot analysis indicated that CsCPL is a component of excretory-secretory products of adult, in mature form of protease. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that CsCPL is also expressed in metacercaria and cercaria stage. Immunolocalization demonstrated that CsCPL is deposited at adult intestine, or tegument, and tegumentary cell of metacercaria and cercaria (especially at dorsal tegument of cercaria), indicating different secretory routine roles in adult and larva. The characteristics of CsCPL suggested that it may involve in invasion of cercaria into fish and development to metacercaria, excystment of metacercaria, and protein digestion of adult, which may render it a candidate antigen for fish vaccine and serodiagnosis of human clonorchiasis.	2009 Jun	Li Yanwen,Hu Xuchu,Liu Xiaoquan,Xu Jing,Hu Fengyu,Ma Changling,Yu Xinbing	Parasitology research. 105(2) 447-52	Cathepsin L-like protease	MMFVLAAVFWSIFLVPGDSFTVQWRKLAPAQKVSFWKGASPLTSLDSMHMQDVIGVDWNFTLSSIWKHFMTTYKRNYIDPSEHERRFKIFANNFVRISKHNVRFIQGQVSYTMGINEFSDKTDEELKRLRCFRGSLNASRDGSKYITIAAPPPSEIDWRNKGAVTPVKNQGNCGSCWAFSATGAIEGQNFLATGNLVSLSEQQLVDCSSEYGNNACNGGLMDNAFKYVKDSNGIDTEASYPYVSGETGDANPTCRFNLKEAVVRVTGYIDLPRGQVSELKQAVGHYGPISVAINAGLPSFMSYKSGVYSDDQCSSDDLDHGVLLVGYGEENGIPYWLIKNSWGPHWGENGYVKILRDHNNLCGVASMASYPLI	N-terminal His6 tag	B5G4Y8	cysteine-type peptidase	full length	8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19376232	Refolding and purification of the human secreted group IID phospholipase A2 expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.	The secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) are water-soluble enzymes that bind to the surface of both artificial and biological lipid bilayers and hydrolyze the membrane phospholipids. The tissue expression pattern of the human group IID secretory phospholipase A2 (hsPLA2-IID) suggests that the enzyme is involved in the regulation of the immune and inflammatory responses. With an aim to establish an expression system for the hsPLA2-IID in Escherichia coli, the DNA-coding sequence for hsPLA2-IID was subcloned into the vector pET3a, and expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli (BL21). A protocol has been developed to refold the recombinant protein in the presence of guanidinium hydrochloride, using a size-exclusion chromatography matrix followed by dilution and dialysis to remove the excess denaturant. After purification by cation-exchange chromatography, far ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of the recombinant hsPLA2-IID indicated protein secondary structure content similar to the homologous human group IIA secretory phospholipase A2. The refolded recombinant hsPLA2-IID demonstrated Ca(2+)-dependent hydrolytic activity, as measuring the release free fatty acid from phospholipid liposomes. This protein expression and purification system may be useful for site-directed mutagenesis experiments of the hsPLA2-IID which will advance our understanding of the structure-function relationship and biological effects of the protein.	2009 Jul	Fonseca Raquel Gomes,Ferreira Tatiana Lopes,Ward Richard J	Protein expression and purification. 67(2) 82-7	group IID secretory phospholipase A2	GILNLNKMVKQVTGKMPILSYWPYGCHCGLGGRGQPKDATDWCCQTHDCCYDHLKTQGCSIYKDYYRYNFSQGNIHCSDKGSWCEQQLCACDKEVAFCLKRNLDTYQKRLRFYWRPHCRGQTPGC	without signal peptide	Q9UNK4	phospholipase A2, hydrolase		8.0	22.5	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

After purification by cation-exchange chromatography, far ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra of the recombinant hsPLA2-IID indicated protein secondary structure content similar to the homologous human group IIA secretory phospholipase A2. The refolded recombinant hsPLA2-IID demonstrated Ca(2+)-dependent hydrolytic activity, as measuring the release free fatty acid from phospholipid liposomes. This protein expression and purification system may be useful for site-directed mutagenesis experiments of the hsPLA2-IID which will advance our understanding of the structure-function relationship and biological effects of the protein.	2009 Jul	Fonseca Raquel Gomes,Ferreira Tatiana Lopes,Ward Richard J	Protein expression and purification. 67(2) 82-7	group IID secretory phospholipase A2	GILNLNKMVKQVTGKMPILSYWPYGCHCGLGGRGQPKDATDWCCQTHDCCYDHLKTQGCSIYKDYYRYNFSQGNIHCSDKGSWCEQQLCACDKEVAFCLKRNLDTYQKRLRFYWRPHCRGQTPGC	without signal peptide	Q9UNK4	phospholipase A2, hydrolase		8.0	37	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
19404927	On-column refolding of corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 extracellular domain by size exclusion chromatography.	Expressing the extracellular domain of corticotropin releasing factor receptor 1 in Escherichia coli usually results in the formation of inclusion bodies. Here we describe the optimization of refolding by applying size exclusion chromatography with a denaturing guanidine hydrochloride gradient and a refolding buffer containing glycerol. Several chromatographic parameters like gradient length, flow rate, sample concentration and chromatography resin characteristics were evaluated. Recovery yields of refolded protein above 500sing a Superdex 200 column demonstrate the usefulness of this method.	2009 Sep	Ersoy Maria,Matic Sandra,Schmidt Stefan R	Biomedical chromatography : BMC. 23(10) 1121-8	corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1	SLQDQHCESLSLASNISGLQCNASVDLIGTCWPRSPAGQLVVRPCPAFFYGVRYNTTNNGYRECLANGSWAARVNYSECQEILNEEKKSKVHYHVA	24-119 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	P34998	G-protein coupled receptor, Receptor, Transducer	extracellular domain	8.5		f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19407377	Expression, refolding, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa AlgE.	AlgE is an outer membrane protein present in alginate-producing (mucoid) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. AlgE has been overexpressed in insoluble inclusion bodies, purified under denaturing conditions and refolded in a buffer containing decyl beta-D-maltopyranoside. Purified refolded AlgE was detergent-exchanged into n-octyl tetraoxyethylene and diffraction-quality crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The crystals grew as small hexagons with unit-cell parameters a = 98.8, b = 156.8, c = 90.4 A, alpha = beta = gamma = 90.0 degrees . The crystals exhibited the symmetry of space group C222 and diffracted to a minimum d-spacing of 3.0 A. On the basis of the Matthews coefficient (V(M) = 3.28 A(3) Da(-1)), one molecule is estimated to be present in the asymmetric unit.	2009 May	Whitney John C C,Neculai A Mirela,Ohman Dennis E,Howell P Lynne	Acta crystallographica.

19419725	Adsorptive refolding of a highly disulfide-bonded inclusion body protein using anion-exchange chromatography.	alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP) is a prospective biopharmaceutical candidate currently undergoing advanced-stage clinical trials for autoimmune indications. The high AFP expression yields in the form of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli renders the inclusion body route potentially advantageous for process scale commercial manufacture, if high-throughput refolding can be achieved. This study reports the successful development of an &#39;anion-exchange chromatography&#39;-based refolding process for recombinant human AFP (rhAFP), which carries the challenges of contaminant spectrum and molecule complexity. rhAFP was readily refolded on-column at rhAFP concentrations unachievable with dilution refolding due to viscosity and solubility constraints. DEAE-FF functioned as a refolding enhancer to achieve rhAFP refolding yield of 28% and product purity of 95 0n 3h, at 1mg/ml protein refolding concentration. Optimization of both refolding and chromatography column operation parameters (i.e. resin chemistry, column geometry, redox potential and feed conditioning) significantly improved rhAFP refolding efficiency. Compared to dilution refolding, on-column rhAFP refolding productivity was 9-fold higher, while that of off-column refolding was more than an order of magnitude higher. Successful demonstration that a simple anion-exchange column can, in a single step, readily refold and purify semi-crude rhAFP comprising 16 disulfide bonds, will certainly extend the application of column refolding to a myriad of complex industrial inclusion body proteins.	2009 May	Chen Yu,Leong Susanna Su Jan	Journal of chromatography.

19460440	Biochemical characterization of Arabidopsis developmentally regulated G-proteins (DRGs).	Developmentally regulated G-proteins (DRGs) are a highly conserved family of GTP-binding proteins found in archaea, plants, fungi and animals, indicating important roles in fundamental pathways. Their function is poorly understood, but they have been implicated in cell division, proliferation, and growth, as well as several medical conditions. Individual subfamilies within the G-protein superfamily possess unique nucleotide binding and hydrolysis rates that are intrinsic to their cellular function, and so characterization of these rates for a particular G-protein may provide insight into its cellular activity. We have produced recombinant active DRG protein using a bacterial expression system and refolding, and performed biochemical characterization of their GTP binding and hydrolysis. We show that recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana atDRG1 and atDRG2a are able to bind GDP and GTP. We also show that DRGs can hydrolyze GTP in vitro without the assistance of GTPase-activating proteins and guanine exchange factors. The atDRG proteins hydrolyze GTP at a relatively slow rate (0.94x10(-3)min(-1) for DRG1 and 1.36x10(-3)min(-1) for DRG2) that is consistent with their nearest characterized relatives, the Obg subfamily. The ability of DRGs to bind nucleotide substrates without assistance, their slow rate of GTP hydrolysis, heat stress activation and domain conservation suggest a possible role as a chaperone in ribosome assembly in response to stress as it has been suggested for the Obg proteins, a different but related G-protein subfamily.	2009 Jul	O&#39;Connell Anthony,Robin Gautier,Kobe Bostjan,Botella José Ramón	Protein expression and purification. 67(2) 88-95	DRG1	MGIIERIKEIEAEMARTQKNKATEYHLGQLKAKIAKLRTQLLEPPKGASGGGEGFEVTKYGHGRVALIGFPSVGKSTLLTMLTGTHSEAASYEFTTLTCIPGVIHYNDTKIQLLDLPGIIEGASEGKGRGRQVIAVAKSSDLVLMVLDASKSEGHRQILTKELEAVGLRLNKTPPQIYFKKKKTGGISFNTTAPLTHIDEKLCYQILHEYKIHNAEVLFRENATVDDFIDVIEGNRKYIKCVYVYNKIDVVGIDDVDRLSRQPNSIVISCNLKLNLDRLLARMWDEMGLVRVYSKPQGQQPDFDEPFVLSSDRGGCTVEDFCNHVHRTLVKDMKYALVWGTSTRHNPQNCGLSQHLEDEDVVQIVKKKERDEGGRGRFKSHSNAPARIADREKKAPLKQ	C-terminal His6 tag	Q9LQK0	GTPase	full length	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f

19477280	Production enhancement and refolding of caprine growth hormone expressed in Escherichia coli.	This study describes comparison between IPTG and lactose induction on expression of caprine growth hormone (cGH), enhancing cell densities of Escherichia coli cultures and refolding the recombinant cGH, produced as inclusion bodies, to biologically active state. 2-3 times higher cell densities were obtained in shake flask cultures when induction was done with lactose showing almost same level of expression as in case of IPTG induction. With lactose induction highest cell densities were achieved in TB (OD(600) 16.3) and M9NG (OD(600) 16.1) media, producing 885 and 892 mg cGH per liter of the culture, respectively. Lactose induction done at mid-exponential stage resulted in a higher cell density and thus higher product yield. cGH over-expressed as inclusion bodies was solubilized in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer (pH 12.5) containing 2 M urea, followed by dilution and lowering the pH in a step-wise manner to obtain the final solution in 50mM Tris-Cl (pH 9.5). The cGH was purified by Q-Sepharose chromatography followed by gel filtration with a recovery yield of 390n the basis of total cell proteins. The product thus obtained showed a single band by SDS-PAGE analysis. MALDI-TOF analysis showed a single peak with a mass of 21,851 dalton, which is very close to its calculated molecular weight. A bioassay based on proliferation of Nb2 rat lymphoma cells showed that the purified cGH was biologically active.	2009 Aug	Khan Muhammad Altaf,Sadaf Saima,Sajjad Muhammad,Waheed Akhtar M	Protein expression and purification. 68(1) 85-9	growth hormone	AFPAMSLSGLFANAVLRAQHLHQLAADTFKEFERTYIPEGQRYSIQNTQVAFCFSETIPAPTGKNEAQQKSDLELLRISLLLIQSWLGPLQFLSRVFTNSLVFGTSDRVYEKLKDLEEGILALMRELEDVTPRAGQILKQTYDKFDTNMRSDDALLKNYGLLSCFRKDLHKTETYLRVMKCRRFGEASCAF		Q58LV0	hormone	full length	11.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19478445	Crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of the V domain of human nectin-2.	Nectin-2 belongs to a family of immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules that are characterized by the presence of three immunoglobulin-like domains (V, C2 and C2) in the extracellular region. The V domain plays important roles in cell adhesion, NK cell activation and the entry of some herpesvirus. In this study, the V domain of human nectin-2 was expressed in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies, which were subsequently denatured and refolded. The soluble protein was crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted to 1.85 A resolution and belonged to space group P2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 52.3, b = 43.9, c = 56.1 A, beta = 118.2 degrees .	2009 May	Qian Xiaomin,Qi Jianxun,Chu Fuliang,Liu Jun,Li Qing,Yan Jinghua	Acta crystallographica.

19500673	High throughput purification of recombinant human growth hormone using radial flow chromatography.	Recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. Using fed-batch fermentation process, around 670 mg/L of r-hGH was produced at a cell OD600 of 35. Cell lysis followed by detergent washing resulted in semi-purified inclusion bodies with more than 801fb7850urity. Purified inclusion bodies were homogenous in preparation having an average size of 0.6 microm. Inclusion bodies were solubilized at pH 12 in presence of 2M urea and refolded by pulsatile dilution. Refolded protein was purified with DEAE-anion exchange chromatography using both radial and axial flow column (50 ml bed volume each). Higher buffer flow rate (30 ml/min) in radial flow column helped in reducing the batch processing time for purification of refolded r-hGH. Radial column based purification resulted in high throughput recovery of diluted refolded r-hGH in comparison to axial column. More than 400f inclusion body protein could be refolded into bioactive form using the above method in a single batch. Purified r-hGH was analyzed by mass spectroscopy and found to be bioactive by Nb2 cell line proliferation assay. Inclusion body enrichment, mild solubilization, pulsatile refolding and radial flow chromatography worked co-operatively to improve the overall recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies.	2009 Aug	Singh Surinder M,Sharma Aparna,Panda Amulya K	Protein expression and purification. 68(1) 54-9	growth hormone	FPTIPLSRLFDNAMLRAHRLHQLAFDTYQEFEEAYIPKEQKYSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNREETQQKSNLELLRISLLLIQSWLEPVQFLRSVFANSLVYGASDSNVYDLLKDLEEGIQTLMGRLEDGSPRTGQIFKQTYSKFDTNSHNDDALLKNYGLLYCFRKDMDKVETFLRIVQCRSVEGSCGF	without signal peptide	P01241	hormone		8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19505579	Escherichia coli expression and in vitro activation of a unique ligninolytic peroxidase that has a catalytic tyrosine residue.	Heterologous expression of Trametes cervina lignin peroxidase (LiP), the only basidiomycete peroxidase that has a catalytic tyrosine, was investigated. The mature LiP cDNA was cloned into the pET vector and used to transform Escherichia coli. Recombinant LiP protein accumulated in inclusion bodies as an inactive form. Refolding conditions for its in vitro activation-including incorporation of heme and structural Ca2+ ions, and formation of disulfide bridges-were optimized taking as a starting point those reported for other plant and fungal peroxidases. The absorption spectrum of the refolded enzyme was identical to that of wild LiP from T. cervina suggesting that it was properly folded. The enzyme was able to oxidize 1,4-dimethoxybenzene and ferrocytochrome c confirming its high redox potential and ability to oxidize large substrates. However, during oxidation of veratryl alcohol (VA), the physiological LiP substrate, an unexpected initial lag period was observed. Possible modification of the enzyme was investigated by incubating it with H2O2 and VA (for 30 min before dialysis). The pretreated enzyme showed normal kinetics traces for VA oxidation, without the initial lag previously observed. Steady-state kinetics of the pretreated LiP were almost the same as the recombinant enzyme before the pretreatment. Moreover, the catalytic constant (k(cat)) for VA oxidation was comparable to that of wild LiP from T. cervina, although the Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)) was 8-fold higher. The present heterologous expression system provides a valuable tool to investigate structure-function relationships, and autocatalytic activation of the unique T. cervina LiP.	2009 Oct	Miki Yuta,Morales María,Ruiz-Dueñas Francisco J,Martínez María Jesús,Wariishi Hiroyuki,Martínez Angel T	Protein expression and purification. 68(2) 208-14	lignin peroxidase	VSCGGGRSVKNAACCAWFPVLDDIQANLFNGGKCEEEAHEAVRLTFHDAVGFSLAAQKAGKFGGGGADGSILAFSDIETAFIPNFGLEFTTEGFIPFALAHGVSFGDFVQFAGAVGAANCAGGPRLQFLAGRSNISQPSPDGLVPDPTDSADKILARMADIGFSPTEVVHLLASHSIAAQYEVDTDVAGSPFDSTPSVFDTQFFVESLLHGTQFTGSGQGGEVMSPIPGEFRLQSDFALSRDPRTACEWQALVNNQQAMVNNFEAVMSRLAVIGQIPSELVDCSDVIPTPPLAKVAQVGSLPPGKSMADVQVACTNGMPFPSLPTSPGPVQTVAPVLG	24-361 aa	Q60FD2	Oxidoreductase, Peroxidase		9.5	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19555779	Refolding, characterization and crystal structure of (S)-malate dehydrogenase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix.	Tartrate oxidation activity was found in the crude extract of an aerobic hyperthermophilic archaeon Aeropyrum pernix, and the enzyme was identified as (S)-malate dehydrogenase (MDH), which, when produced in Escherichia coli, was mainly obtained as an inactive inclusion body. The inclusion body was dissolved in 6 M guanidine-HCl and gradually refolded to the active enzyme through dilution of the denaturant. The purified recombinant enzyme consisted of four identical subunits with a molecular mass of about 110 kDa. NADP was preferred as a coenzyme over NAD for (S)-malate oxidation and, unlike MDHs from other sources, this enzyme readily catalyzed the oxidation of (2S,3S)-tartrate and (2S,3R)-tartrate. The tartrate oxidation activity was also observed in MDHs from the hyperthermophilic archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Archaeoglobus fulgidus, suggesting these hyperthermophilic MDHs loosely bind their substrates. The refolded A. pernix MDH was also crystallized, and the structure was determined at a resolution of 2.9 A. Its overall structure was similar to those of the M. jannaschii, Chloroflexus aurantiacus, Chlorobium vibrioforme and Cryptosporidium parvum [lactate dehydrogenase-like] MDHs with root-mean-square-deviation values between 1.4 and 2.1 A. Consistent with earlier reports, Ala at position 53 was responsible for coenzyme specificity, and the next residue, Arg, was important for NADP binding. Structural comparison revealed that the hyperthermostability of the A. pernix MDH is likely attributable to its smaller cavity volume and larger numbers of ion pairs and ion-pair networks, but the molecular strategy for thermostability may be specific for each enzyme.	2009 Sep	Kawakami Ryushi,Sakuraba Haruhiko,Goda Shuichiro,Tsuge Hideaki,Ohshima Toshihisa	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1794(10) 1496-504	(S)-malate dehydrogenase	MITILGAGKVGMATAVMLMMRGYDDLLLIARTPGKPQGEALDLAHAAAELGVDIRISGSNSYEDMRGSDIVLVTAGIGRKPGMTREQLLEANANTMADLAEKIKAYAKDAIVVITTNPVDAMTYVMYKKTGFPRERVIGFSGILDSARMAYYISQKLGVSFKSVNAIVLGMHGQKMFPVPRLSSVGGVPLEHLMSKEEIEEVVSETVNAGAKITELRGYSSNYGPAAGLVLTVEAIKRDSKRIYPYSLYLQGEYGYNDIVAEVPAVIGKSGIERIIELPLTEDEKRKFDEAVQAVKKLVETLPPQLRE		Q9YEA1	Oxidoreductase	full length	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
19576990	Expression, purification and characterization of a functional extracellular domain of porcine FcgammaRII.	FcgammaRs are involved in regulating a multitude of innate and adaptive immune responses, which makes them attractive targets for the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches. In this report, we describe a simple method for the production of a large quantity of recombinant porcine FcgammaRII. The extracellular domain of the porcine FcgammaRII (poFcgammaRII) gene was constructed and cloned into the Escherichiacoli expression vector pET-28a. The recombinant protein was expressed at high level in E. coil BL21 (DE3) and existed mainly as inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6M guanidine hydrochloride and purified by Ni-chelation, and refolded by rapid dilution. After purification and renaturation, the recombinant soluble protein (rsFcgammaRII) coated on high-binding ELISA plates, showed concentration dependent binding of porcine IgG and the binding of porcine IgG to the surface bound rsFcgammaRII was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by soluble rsFcgammaRII itself. Then by the inhibition assay we evaluated the effectiveness of the rsFcgammaRII in inhibiting the IgG binding to the whole molecule of poFcgammaRII expressed on the Marc-145 cell surface, the rsFcgammaRII inhibited the binding of porcine IgG to the transfected Marc-145 cell&#39;s surface, with an IC(50) value of 0.87 microM, demonstrating that rsFcgammaRII manifests the similar specificity as native poFcgammaRII. The method for highly efficient production of biologically active poFcgammaRII may be employed for both basic research and potential clinical applications.	2009 Aug	Tian Xiaohui,Wang Aiping,Qiao Songlin,Zhang Gaiping,Xi Jun,Li Xuewu,Liu Yunchao,Xu Yuqing	Protein expression and purification. 68(1) 12-7	Fc gamma RII	VLPKA EVKLQPAWIN VLQEDSVTLT CQGDHDPGNT TTQWFHNGNF TWTENQPSFS FKARRASSGH YRCQTAYSSL SDPVHLDVIS DWLLLQTSSL VFQEGEPILL RCHSWRNKPL HKVAFFQNGK SKKFSYVDSN FSIPQANQSH SGEYHCTGFI GKMSYSSQSV NITVQGSSLN NLL	46-223 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	Q461P7	Receptor	extracellular domain	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19643977	Design, expression and characterization of mutants of fasciculin optimized for interaction with its target, acetylcholinesterase.	Predicting mutations that enhance protein-protein affinity remains a challenging task, especially for high-affinity complexes. To test our capability to improve the affinity of such complexes, we studied interaction of acetylcholinesterase with the snake toxin, fasciculin. Using the program ORBIT, we redesigned fasciculin&#39;s sequence to enhance its interactions with Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase. Mutations were predicted in 5 out of 13 interfacial residues on fasciculin, preserving most of the polar inter-molecular contacts seen in the wild-type toxin/enzyme complex. To experimentally characterize fasciculin mutants, we developed an efficient strategy to over-express the toxin in Escherichia coli, followed by refolding to the native conformation. Despite our predictions, a designed quintuple fasciculin mutant displayed reduced affinity for the enzyme. However, removal of a single mutation in the designed sequence produced a quadruple mutant with improved affinity. Moreover, one designed mutation produced 7-fold enhancement in affinity for acetylcholinesterase. This led us to reassess our criteria for enhancing affinity of the toxin for the enzyme. We observed that the change in the predicted inter-molecular energy, rather than in the total energy, correlates well with the change in the experimental free energy of binding, and hence may serve as a criterion for enhancement of affinity in protein-protein complexes.	2009 Sep	Sharabi Oz,Peleg Yoav,Mashiach Efrat,Vardy Eyal,Ashani Yacov,Silman Israel,Sussman Joel L,Shifman Julia M	Protein engineering, design &amp; selection : PEDS. 22(10) 641-8	fasciculin-2	TMCYSHTTTS RAILTNCGEN SCYRKSRRHP PKMVLGRGCG CPPGDDNLEV KCCTSPDKCN Y		P0C1Z0	Toxin	full length	9.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

To test our capability to improve the affinity of such complexes, we studied interaction of acetylcholinesterase with the snake toxin, fasciculin. Using the program ORBIT, we redesigned fasciculin&#39;s sequence to enhance its interactions with Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase. Mutations were predicted in 5 out of 13 interfacial residues on fasciculin, preserving most of the polar inter-molecular contacts seen in the wild-type toxin/enzyme complex. To experimentally characterize fasciculin mutants, we developed an efficient strategy to over-express the toxin in Escherichia coli, followed by refolding to the native conformation. Despite our predictions, a designed quintuple fasciculin mutant displayed reduced affinity for the enzyme. However, removal of a single mutation in the designed sequence produced a quadruple mutant with improved affinity. Moreover, one designed mutation produced 7-fold enhancement in affinity for acetylcholinesterase. This led us to reassess our criteria for enhancing affinity of the toxin for the enzyme. We observed that the change in the predicted inter-molecular energy, rather than in the total energy, correlates well with the change in the experimental free energy of binding, and hence may serve as a criterion for enhancement of affinity in protein-protein complexes.	2009 Sep	Sharabi Oz,Peleg Yoav,Mashiach Efrat,Vardy Eyal,Ashani Yacov,Silman Israel,Sussman Joel L,Shifman Julia M	Protein engineering, design &amp; selection : PEDS. 22(10) 641-8	fasciculin-2	TMCYSHTVTS RAILTNCGEN SCYRKSRRHP PKMVLGRGCG CPPGDDNLEV KCCTSPDKCN Y	T8V mutant	P0C1Z0	Toxin	full length	9.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

19647081	Expressions and purification of a mature form of recombinant human Chemerin in Escherichia coli.	Chemerin is a novel chemokine that binds to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ChemR23, also known as chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1). It is secreted as a precursor and executes pro-inflammatory functions when the last six amino acids are removed from its C-terminus by serine proteases. After maturation, Chemerin attracts dendritic cells and macrophages through binding to ChemR23. We report a new method for expression and purification of mature recombinant human Chemerin (rhChemerin) using a prokaryotic system. After being expressed in bacteria, rhChemerin in inclusion bodies was denatured using 6M guanidine chloride. Soluble rhChemerin was prepared by the protein-specific renaturation solution under defined conditions. It was subsequently purified using ion-exchange columns to more than 951fb7850urity with endotoxin level &lt;1.0 EU/microg. We further demonstrated its biological activities for attracting migration of human dendritic cells and murine macrophages in vitro using established chemotaxis assays.	2009 Nov	Xiang Di,Zhang Jing,Chen Yizhe,Guo Yiping,Schalow Adrian,Zhang Zhonghui,Hu Xiaojia,Yu Hongjing,Zhao Mei,Zhu Shunying,Lu Huili,Wu Mingyuan,Yu Yan,Moldenhauer Anja,Han Wei	Protein expression and purification. 69(2) 153-8	Chemerin	ELTEAQRRGLQVALEEFHKHPPVQWAFQETSVESAVDTPFPAGIFVRLEFKLQQTSCRKRDWKKPECKVRPNGRKRKCLACIKLGSEDKVLGRLVHCPIETQVLREAEEHQETQCLRVQRAGEDPHSFYFPGQFAFS	21-157 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	Q99969	chemokine		9.5		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
19651623	Expression and purification of active recombinant equine lysozyme in Escherichia coli.	Equine lysozyme (EL) is a calcium (Ca)-binding lysozyme and is an intermediary link between non-Ca-binding C-type lysozyme and alpha-lactalbumin. The feature of lysozymes to assemble into the fibrils has recently gained considerable attention for the investigation of the functional properties of these proteins. To study the structural and functional properties of EL, a synthetic gene was cloned and EL was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a fused protein. The His-tagged recombinant EL was accumulated as inclusion bodies. Up to 50 mg/l of the recombinant EL could be achieved after purification by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography, refolding in the presence of arginine, CM-Sepharose column purification following TEV protease cleavage. The purified protein was functionally active, as determined by the lysozyme activity, proving the proper folding of protein. The purified lysozyme was used for the oligomerisation studies. The protein formed amyloid fibrils during incubation in acidic pH and elevated temperature. The recombinant EL forms two types of fibrils: ring shaped and linear, similar to the native EL.	2009 Oct	Casaite Vida,Bruzyte Simona,Bukauskas Virginijus,Setkus Arunas,Morozova-Roche Ludmilla A,Meskys Rolandas	Protein engineering, design &amp; selection : PEDS. 22(11) 649-54	equine lysozyme	KVFSKCELAHKLKAQEMDGFGGYSLANWVCMAEYESNFNTRAFNGKNANGSSDYGLFQLNNKWWCKDNKRSSSNACNIMCSKLLDENIDDDISCAKRVVRDPKGMSAWKAWVKHCKDKDLSEYLASCNL	N-terminal His6 tag	P11376	Antimicrobial, Bacteriolytic enzyme, Glycosidase, Hydrolase	full length	8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19694409	A C-terminal lobe of the beta subunit of Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase resembles cell adhesion molecules.	The beta subunit of Na,K-ATPase is required for stabilization and maturation of the catalytic alpha subunits and is also involved in cell adhesion and establishing epithelial cell polarity. However, the mechanism of cell adhesion effects and protein partners of beta are unknown. We have applied fold recognition methods to predict that a C-terminal domain of the beta subunits of Na,K-ATPase and H,K-ATPase has an immunoglobulin-like fold, which resembles cell adhesion molecules. Comparison of the predicted C-terminal domain with a recently published structure of shark rectal gland Na,K-ATPase at 2.4 A in which alpha, beta, and FXYD subunits were resolved confirms that the beta subunit ectodomain contains an immunoglobulin-like structure. Expression in Escherichia coli of a sequence corresponding to the C-terminal domain, followed by its purification, refolding, and circular dichroism analysis, shows that the domain is independently stable with prominent beta sheet secondary structure, as predicted. Proteolytic digestion of the purified detergent-soluble recombinant Na,K-ATPase (alpha1beta1) is also indicative of a stable C-terminal domain of beta in the native complex. The major conclusion of this work is consistent with prior evidence for a role of the beta subunit in cell-cell adhesion, and it attributes that function largely to the C-terminal lobe of the beta ectodomain. In the light of these findings, we discuss its role in cell adhesion and recognition of the beta subunits of Na,K-ATPase, including potential protein partners.	2009 Sep	Bab-Dinitz Elizabeta,Albeck Shira,Peleg Yoav,Brumfeld Vlad,Gottschalk Kay E,Karlish Steven J D	Biochemistry. 48(36) 8684-91	Na,K-ATPase beta1 subunit	LGFKPKP PKNESLETYP VMKYNPNVLP VQCTGKRDED KDKVGNVEYF GLGNSPGFPL QYYPYYGKLL QPKYLQPLLA VQFTNLTMDT EIRIECKAYG ENIGYSEKDR FQGRFDVKIE VK	N-terminak His6 tag, 184-302 aa	P05026	sodium:potassium-exchanging ATPase	C-terminal fragment			t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f

19716382	LIGHT protein suppresses tumor growth by augmentation of immune response.	The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member LIGHT has potent anti-tumor activities through activation of the immune response, and it is a promising candidate for use in cancer immunotherapy. However, there are no reports of the anti-tumor effects of LIGHT protein in vivo because of the lack of easy, efficient methods of manufacturing this protein. Here, we developed a method of manufacturing recombinant LIGHT protein using Escherichia coli through refolding of inclusion bodies; we then evaluated the anti-tumor activity of the protein. LIGHT protein expressed in E. coli showed the same biological activities and binding affinities to its receptors as did LIGHT expressed in mammalian cells. In addition, intratumoral injection of LIGHT significantly suppressed tumor growth, with augmentation of antigen-specific IFN-gamma-producing cells in the regional lymph nodes and spleen. These results indicate that LIGHT protein efficiently evokes the systemic tumor-specific immune response, and thus induces tumor suppression.	2009 Nov	Morishige Tomohiro,Yoshioka Yasuo,Inakura Hiroshi,Tanabe Aya,Watanabe Hikaru,Yao Xinglei,Tsunoda Shin-Ichi,Tsutsumi Yasuo,Mukai Yohei,Okada Naoki,Nakagawa Shinsaku	Immunology letters. 127(1) 33-8	LIGHT	GEMVT RLPDGPAGSW EQLIQERRSH EVNPAAHLTG ANSSLTGSGG PLLWETQLGL AFLRGLSYHD GALVVTKAGY YYIYSKVQLG GVGCPLGLAS TITHGLYKRT PRYPEELELL VSQQSPCGRA TSSSRVWWDS SFLGGVVHLE AGEKVVVRVL DERLVRLRDG TRSYFGAFMV	66-240 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	O43557	Cytokine	extracellular domain	9.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

It has been found that LK is composed of a group of isoenzymes. To construct and express the mature peptide of LK PI239 in Escherichia coli, we amplified and optimized the gene of LK which was then cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-22b(-). The recombinant LK (rLK) protein was expressed as inclusion bodies and we have developed a purification process of rLK from these inclusion bodies. A step-down urea concentration strategy was applied to the rLK renaturation process. The purified and renatured rLK apparently ameliorated the conditions of the model thrombosis rats used, and may be developed into a therapeutic agent for thrombotic-associated diseases.	2009 Nov	Xu Zhe-rong,Yang Yun-mei,Gui Qi-feng,Zhang Li-na,Hu Lin	Protein expression and purification. 69(2) 198-203	lumbrokinase PI239	IVGGIE ARPYEFPWQV SVRRKSSDSH FCGGSIINDR WVVCAAHCMQ GESPALVSLV VGEHDSSAAS TVRQTHDVDS IFVHEDYNGN TFENDVSVIK TVNAIAIDIN VGPICAPDPA NDYVYRKSQC SGWGTINSGG VCCPNVLRYV TLNVTTNAFC DDIYSPLYTI TSDMICATDN TGQNERDSCQ GDSGGPLSVK DGSGIFSLIG IVSWGIGCAS GYPGVYARVG SQTGWITDII TNN	45-283 aa	Q95V22	kinase		8.0	20	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
19725122	Prokaryotic expression, in vitro folding, and molecular pharmacological characterization of the neuropeptide Y receptor type 2.	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a class of membrane proteins that represent a major target for pharmacological developments. However, there is still little knowledge about GPCR structure and dynamics since high-level expression and characterization of active GPCRs in vitro is extremely complicated. Here, we describe the recombinant expression and functional folding of the human Y(2) receptor from inclusion bodies of E. coli cultures. Milligram protein quantities were produced using high density fermentation and isolated in a single step purification with a yield of over 20 mg/L culture. Extensive studies were carried out on in vitro refolding and stabilization of the isolated receptor in detergent solution. The specific binding of the ligand, the 36 residue neuropeptide Y (NPY), to the recombinant Y(2) receptors in micellar form was shown by several radioligand affinity assays. In competition experiments, an IC(50) value in low nanomolar range could be determined. Further, a K(D) value of 1.9 nM was determined from a saturation assay, where NPY was titrated to the recombinant Y(2) receptors.	2009 Dec	Schmidt Peter,Lindner Diana,Montag Cindy,Berndt Sandra,Beck-Sickinger Annette G,Rudolph Rainer,Huster Daniel	Biotechnology progress. 25(6) 1732-9	neuropeptide Y receptor type 2	MGPIGAEADENQTVEEMKVEQYGPQTTPRGELVPDPEPELIDSTKLIEVQVVLILAYCSIILLGVIGNSLVIHVVIKFKSMRTVTNFFIANLAVADLLVNTLCLPFTLTYTLMGEWKMGPVLCHLVPYAQGLAVQVSTITLTVIALDRHRCIVYHLESKISKRISFLIIGLAWGISALLASPLAIFREYSLIEIIPDFEIVACTEKWPGEEKSIYGTVYSLSSLLILYVLPLGIISFSYTRIWSKLKNHVSPGAANDHYHQRRQKTTKMLVCVVVVFAVSWLPLHAFQLAVDIDSQVLDLKEYKLIFTVFHIIAMCSTFANPLLYGWMNSNYRKAFLSAFRCEQRLDAIHSEVSVTFKAKKNLEVRKNSGPNDSFTEATNV	C-terminal His8 tag	P49146	G-protein coupled receptor, Receptor, Transducer	full length	8.5	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
19786799	Structural and IgE binding analyses of recombinant Der p 2 expressed from the hosts Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris.	BACKGROUND:The house dust mite allergen Der p 2 is one of the most important indoor allergens associated with allergic disease. Recombinant Der (rDer) p 2 with high IgE binding activity can be readily produced in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, but the structure and IgE binding of the different methods of preparation have not been compared.METHODS:Secondary structure was assessed by circular dichroism (CD). Intrinsic fluorescence and hydrophobic probe (1-anilinonaphthalene 8-sulphonic acid, ANS) were used to study the Der p 2 hydrophobic cavity. IgE binding was assessed by ELISA inhibition.RESULTS:CD analysis showed the expected secondary structure for both nDer p 2 and refolded Der p 2 prepared from E. coli inclusion bodies but primarily random structure for Der p 2 secreted from P. pastoris. The secreted product, however, had disulphide bonding and could be refolded to a similar structure to natural Der (nDer) p 2 after precipitation with trichloro-acetic or ammonium sulphate. ANS binding and intrinsic Trp92 fluorescence showed that all recombinant proteins were different to nDer p 2 and that the allergen secreted from P. pastoris did not form a hydrophobic cavity. Despite the marked structural changes, all preparations of Der p 2 had similar IgE binding to nDer p 2.CONCLUSION:Despite almost identical IgE binding, rDer p 2 prepared from both E. coli and P. pastoris showed structural differences to nDer p 2. Der p 2 secreted from P. pastoris lacked most of the natural structure, but refolding could induce the natural structure.	2010 Feb	Tanyaratsrisakul S,Malainual N,Jirapongsananuruk O,Smith W A,Thomas W R,Piboonpocanun S	International archives of allergy and immunology. 151(3) 190-8	house dust mite allergen Der p 2	DQVDVKDCANHEIKKVLVPGCHGSEPCIIHRGKPFQLEAVFEANQNTKTAKIEIKASIDGLEVDVPGIDPNACHYMKCPLVKGQQYDIKYTWNVPKIAPKSENVVVTVKVMGDDGVLACAIATHAKIRD	without signal peptide, His6 tag	P49278			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
19823948	Optimized procedure for expression and renaturation of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 at high protein concentrations.	A prokaryotic expression system has been used to produce recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). However, low rhBMP-2 yields and protein loss during purification and renaturation are the hurdles in the clinical application. Previous studies have indicated that variables such as temperature, host cell, salt concentration, and culture time affect the final rhBMP-2 yield. The optimization of these conditions in an Escherichia coli culture yielded 28.258 mg of rhBMP-2 per liter of culture. To reduce rhBMP-2 loss during purification and renaturation, we performed purification before renaturation in the prokaryotic expression system instead of using the traditional renaturation-before-purification approach. rhBMP-2 was separated on a Sephacryl S-300 HR column and eluted from a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column. The collected protein was refolded by dialysis with urea buffer, which was followed by dialysis with ultrapure water. The purified rhBMP-2 dimer significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteogenic activity in the femoral muscle and showed the same level of bone-forming activity as natural BMP-2. This optimized procedure for expression and renaturation of rhBMP-2 has potential clinical applications.	2010 Sep	Zhang Hongbin,Wu Jie,Zhang Yu,Fu Na,Wang Jie,Zhao Shujin	Molecular biology reports. 37(7) 3089-95	bone morphogenetic protein-2	QAKHKQRKRLKSSCKRHPLYVDFSDVGWNDWIVAPPGYHAFYCHGECPFPLADHLNSTNHAIVQTLVNSVNSKIPKACCVPTELSAISMLYLDENEKVVLKNYQDMVVEGCGCR	283-396 aa	P12643	Cytokine, Developmental protein, Growth factor	mature BMP-2	8.2	4	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The Neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein PorB was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies by denaturation in urea followed by refolding in buffered LDAO on a size-exclusion column. PorB has been crystallized in three different crystal forms: C222, R32 and P6(3). The C222 crystal form may contain either one or two PorB monomers in the asymmetric unit, while both the R32 and P6(3) crystal forms contained one PorB monomer in the asymmetric unit. Of the three, the P6(3) crystal form had the best diffraction quality, yielding data extending to 2.3 A resolution.	2009 Oct	Tanabe Mikio,Iverson Tina M	Acta crystallographica.

19853037	Refolding active human DNA polymerase nu from inclusion bodies.	Human DNA polymerase nu (Pol nu) is a conserved family A DNA polymerase of uncertain biological function. Physical and biochemical characterization aimed at understanding Pol nu function is hindered by the fact that, when over-expressed in Escherichia coli, Pol nu is largely insoluble, and the small amount of soluble protein is difficult to purify. Here we describe the use of high hydrostatic pressure to refold Pol nu from inclusion bodies, in soluble and active form. The refolded Pol nu has properties comparable to those of the small amount of Pol nu that was purified from the soluble fraction. The approach described here may be applicable to other DNA polymerases that are expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli.	2010 Feb	Arana Mercedes E,Powell Gary K,Edwards Lori L,Kunkel Thomas A,Petrovich Robert M	Protein expression and purification. 70(2) 163-71	DNA polymerase nu	EEDTDD AEGYLNSGNS GALKKHFCDI RHLDDWAKSQ LIEMLKQAAA LVITVMYTDG STQLGADQTP VSSVRGIVVL VKRQAEGGHG CPDAPACGPV LEGFVSDDPC IYIQIEHSAI WDQEQEAHQQ FARNVLFQTM KCKCPVICFN AKDFVRIVLQ FFGNDGSWKH VADFIGLDPR IAAWLIDPSD ATPSFEDLVE KYCEKSITVK VNSTYGNSSR NIVNQNVREN LKTLYRLTMD LCSKLKDYGL WQLFRTLELP LIPILAVMES HAIQVNKEEM EKTSALLGAR LKELEQEAHF VAGERFLITS NNQLREILFG KLKLHLLSQR NSLPRTGLQK YPSTSEAVLN ALRDLHPLPK IILEYRQVHK IKSTFVDGLL ACMKKGSISS TWNQTGTVTG RLSAKHPNIQ GISKHPIQIT TPKNFKGKED KILTISPRAM FVSSKGHTFL AADFSQIELR ILTHLSGDPE LLKLFQESER DDVFSTLTSQ WKDVPVEQVT HADREQTKKV VYAVVYGAGK ERLAACLGVP IQEAAQFLES FLQKYKKIKD FARAAIAQCH QTGCVVSIMG RRRPLPRIHA HDQQLRAQAE RQAVNFVVQG SAADLCKLAM IHVFTAVAAS HTLTARLVAQ IHDELLFEVE DPQIPECAAL VRRTMESLEQ VQALELQLQV PLKVSLSAGR SWGHLVPLQE AWG	175-863 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	Q7Z5Q5	DNA-directed DNA polymerase, Nucleotidyltransferase, Transferase		8.0	20	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19853065	A comparative analysis of the fluorescence properties of the wild-type and active site mutants of the hepatitis C virus autoprotease NS2-3.	Hepatitis C virus encodes an autoprotease, NS2-3, which is required for processing of the viral polyprotein between the non-structural NS2 and NS3 proteins. This protease activity is vital for the replication and assembly of the virus and therefore represents a target for the development of anti-viral drugs. The mechanism of this auto-processing reaction is not yet clear but the protease activity has been shown to map to the C-terminal region of NS2 and the N-terminal serine protease region of NS3. The NS2-3 precursor can be expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, purified as denatured protein and refolded, in the presence of detergents and the divalent metal ion zinc, into an active form capable of auto-cleavage. Here, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence has been used to assess refolding in the wild-type protein and specific active site mutants. We also investigate the effects on protein folding of alterations to the reaction conditions that have been shown to prevent auto-cleavage. Our data demonstrate that these active site mutations do not solely affect the cleavage activity of the HCV NS2-3 protease but significantly affect the integrity of the global protein fold.	2009 Nov	Foster Toshana L,Tedbury Philip R,Pearson Arwen R,Harris Mark	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1804(1) 212-22	hepatitis C virus autoprotease NS2-3	RAAL THVPYFVRAH ALIRVCALVK QLAGGRYVQV ALLALGRWTG TYIYDHLTPM SDWAASGLRD LAVAVEPIIF SPMEKKVIVW GAETAACGDI LHGLPVSARL GQEILLGPAD GYTSKGWKLL APITAYAQQT RGLLGAIVVS MTGRDRTEQA GEVQILSTVS QSFLGTTISG VLWTVYHGAG NKTLAGLRGP VTQMYSSAEG DLVGWPSPPG TKSLEPCKCG AVDLYLVTRN ADVIPARRRG DKRGALLSPR PISTLKGSSG GPVLCPRGHV VGLFRAAVCS RGVAKSIDFI PVETLDVVTR	907-1210 aa, N-terminal His6 tag, C-tarminal FLAG tag	Q99IB8			7	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f

19857531	Cloning, microbial expression and structure-activity relationship of polyphenol oxidases from Camellia sinensis.	Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) can be used for organic synthesis and degradation of wastes and dyes in industries. Lack of enzyme sources is a major barrier for its application. A PPO gene, with a full length of 1.8kb without introns, was cloned by PCR from genomic DNA of five common cultivars of Camellia sinensis. They had a 98.2-99.9 0egree of identity in nucleotides and 94.7-96.1 0n amino acids and encoded a polypeptide of 599 amino acids with a signal peptide targeting the chloroplast and three Cu-binding domains. The mature PPO showed high expression and enzyme activity after refolding the inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using pET30c expression vector, but low expression in Pichia pastoris GS115 using both the secretory and non-secretory vectors pPICZalphaA and pPICZA. The expression of PPO mutants demonstrated that the signal sequences prevented recombinant gene expression in E. coli. PPO activity was not affected by the C-terminus and was slightly inhibited by the CuC domain. Other domains were important for its activity. A 3.1-fold increase in PPO activity over non-recombinant controls was obtained by expressing the PPO fragment without signal sequences and the CuC domain in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the pET30c vector.	2009 Dec	Wu Yi-Liang,Pan Li-Ping,Yu Si-Li,Li Hai-Hang	Journal of biotechnology. 145(1) 66-72	Polyphenol oxidase	APVT APDLSKCGAA DLPADAKPTN CCPPKTNKII EFKLPPPSNI LRVRPAAHLA DEKHIAKFSK ALQLMKSLPD DDPRSFKQQS NIHCAYCEGA YHQVGFPSTE LQVHNSWLFF PFHRFYLYFF EKILGMLLDD PAFAIPFWNW DSPAGMKIPA MYADINSPLY NRLRDAKHQP PTLIDLDYNL TDPKNVDEEK QKLRNLTIMY RQVVSGGKTP RLFLGSSYRA GDDPDPGAGS LENIPHGPVH IWCGDRTQPN LEDMGNFYSA GRDPIFYGHH ANVDRIWTVW KTLGGKRNDF KDSDCLNSEF TFYDENAQLV TVKVKESLDH RKLGYVYQDV EIPWLNARPS PRISNFFRKI KNKAGIAMAT ETLDSAAIVF PRKLDEVVKV VVKRPTKSRS EREKEEEEEV VVVEGIEMER DVSVKFDVFI NDEDEAASGP EKTEFAGSFV NVPRKHKHDK KIRTSLRLGI TELLEDLEAE DDESVLVTLV PRYGSDAVTI GGVKIEFDS	without signal peptide, 97-599 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	A6NAA0	catechol oxidase		8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
19917314	Expression, purification of herpes simplex virus type 1 UL4 protein, and production and characterization of UL4 polyclonal antibody.	The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) UL4 protein is a late protein encoded by the UL4 gene. To date, the function of this protein is poorly understood. To aid further investigation of the function of this protein, the UL4 gene was cloned into the vector pET28a (+) to express His-tagged UL4 protein in Escherichia coli. The recombinant fusion protein was purified from inclusion body by histidine selected nickel affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. After refolding, the purified recombinant protein was used to produce anti-UL4 polyclonal antibody. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the polyclonal sera could recognize the purified UL4 protein specifically, and in the immunofluorescence assay, the antibody was able to probe the UL4 protein with a punctate staining in HSV-1 infected cells.	2010 Feb	Pan Weiwei,Ren Xiaoming,Guo Hong,Ding Qiong,Zheng Alan C	Journal of virological methods. 163(2) 465-9	UL4	MSNPQTTIAYSLCHARASLTSALPDAAQVVHVFEYGTRAIMVRGRERQDRLPRGGVVIQHTPIGLLVIIDCRAEFCAYRFIGRDSNQKLERGWDAHMYAYPFDSWVSSSRGESARSATAGILTVVWTADTIYITATIYGSPPEETPGAAHGVGAAPPPPTTACPGTAEFLQPTADLLVEVLREIQLSPALEYADKLLGS	N-terminal His6 tag	P10188		full length	8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
19932158	Efficient preparation and PEGylation of recombinant human non-glycosylated erythropoietin expressed as inclusion body in E. coli.	Recombinant human erythropoietin produced by mammalian cells contains about 40carbohydrates which maintain its stability and long residence in body. However, mammalian derived Epo has low yields and high costs of production. In this article, a cost-effective strategy of producing non-glycosylated Epo from Escherichia coli and then PEGylating it to replace the role of sugar chains was investigated. Recombinant human non-glycosylated erythropoietin (rh-ngEpo) was overexpressed as inclusion body in E. coli. As the routine inclusion body washing step resulted in poor protein recovery and purity, a new process scheme of using strong ion-exchange chromatography to purify denatured rh-ngEpo from inclusion body before refolding was developed. The purity of the denatured rh-ngEpo was increased from 590 over 90%. Rh-ngEpo was then refolded and subsequently purified by one step of weak cation-exchange chromatography to 981fb7850ure. Final protein yield was 129 mg/l, a significant improvement from 49 mg/l obtained via the conventional practice. The in vitro bioactivity of purified rh-ngEpo was comparable with the CHO-expressed Epo and the formation of native secondary structure was also confirmed by CD spectra. Rh-ngEpo was then modified by a 20 kDa methoxy polyethylene glycol (PEG) succinimidyl carbonate. The monoPEGylated protein, which retained 680ioactivity, had enhanced thermal stability and a remarkably prolonged circulating half-life in rats as compared with that of the unmodified protein. These studies demonstrated the feasibility of PEGylating rh-ngEpo as a promising way for the development of new Epo drugs.	2010 Feb	Wang Yin-Jue,Liu Yong-Dong,Chen Jing,Hao Su-Juan,Hu Tao,Ma Guang-Hui,Su Zhi-Guo	International journal of pharmaceutics. 386(1-2) 156-64	erythropoietin	APPRLICDSRVLERYLLEAKEAENITTGCAEHCSLNENITVPDTKVNFYAWKRMEVGQQAVEVWQGLALLSEAVLRGQALLVNSSQPWEPLQLHVDKAVSGLRSLTTLLRALGAQKEAISPPDAASAAPLRTITADTFRKLFRVYSNFLRGKLKLYTGEACRTGDR	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag	P01588	Hormone		8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

20022636	Isolation and immunological characterization of a novel Cladosporium herbarum allergen structurally homologous to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold superfamily.	Because the ascomycete Cladosporium herbarum embodies one of the most important, world-wide occurring fungal species responsible for eliciting typical IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions ranging from rhinitis and ocular symptoms to severe involvement of the lower respiratory tract, a more comprehensive definition of its detailed allergen repertoire is unquestionably of critical medical as well as therapeutic significance. By screening a C. herbarum cDNA library with IgE antibodies pooled from 3 mold-reactive sera, we were able to identify, clone and affinity-purify a novel allergen candidate (29.9 kDa) exhibiting considerable (three-dimensional) homology to the alpha/beta hydrolase fold superfamily. The latter covers a collection of hydrolytic enzymes of widely differing phylogenetic origin as well as catalytic activity (operating in countless biological contexts) that in general exhibit only little sequence similarity yet show a remarkable conservation of structural topology. Our present study (i) characterizes recombinant non-fusion C. herbarum hydrolase as a natively folded, minor mold allergen that displays a prevalence of IgE reactivity of approximately 17 0n our in vitro immunoblot experiments, (ii) proposes the existence of several putative (speculatively cross-reactive) ascomycete orthologues as determined via genome-wide in silico predictions, and (iii) finally implies that C. herbarum hydrolase could be included in forthcoming minimal testing sets when fungal allergy is suspected.	2010 Mar	Rid Raphaela,Onder Kamil,Hawranek Thomas,Laimer Martin,Bauer Johann W,Holler Claudia,Simon-Nobbe Birgit,Breitenbach Michael	Molecular immunology. 47(6) 1366-77	hydrolase	MPAGLQYVTTDGGRLAVEITGKETDPLVICSPGMGDTRDAYKPLAKVLVSNGYRVAAMDARAHGESSAKFARYGDEATADDFLTVANELSPGSPVVLAGASFSAAAATIAAAKQPERVSKIILLGPFLRNGMGVVGLWLMPVMFAWPWGPAAWEMYAATLWPGLEGDGAKKRAATTRASLTRPGRWAGFQALISSLDHRVVAPYISSVRAPALVVMGDKDPDWSDPKVEAEWVASNFSQVDTLMVPEAGHAPMYERPQVVAERVLSFLGDQTNV	N-terminal His6 tag	B8K1W4	Hydrolase	full length	7.4		f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
20045493	MeuTXKbeta1, a scorpion venom-derived two-domain potassium channel toxin-like peptide with cytolytic activity.	Recent studies have demonstrated that scorpion venom contains unique two-domain peptides with the peculiarity of possessing different functions, i.e. neurotoxic and cytolytic activities. Here we report systematic characterization of a new two-domain peptide (named MeuTXKbeta1) belonging to the TsTXKbeta molecular subfamily from the scorpion Mesobuthus eupeus by molecular cloning, biochemical purification, recombinant expression, functional assays, CD and NMR studies. Its full-length bioactive form as well as 1-21 and 22-72 fragments (named N(1-21) and C(22-72), respectively) was produced in Escherichia coli by an on-column refolding approach. Recombinant peptide (rMeuTXKbeta1) exhibited a low affinity for K(+) channels and cytolytic effects against bacteria and several eukaryotic cells. N(1-21) was found to preserve anti-Plasmodium activity in contrast to haemolytic activity, whereas C(22-72) retains these two activities. Circular dichroism analysis demonstrates that rMeuTXKbeta1 presents a typical scorpion toxin scaffold in water and its alpha-helical content largely increases in a membrane-mimicking environment, consistent with the NMR structure of N(1-21) and an ab initio structure model of MeuTXKbeta1 predicted using I-TASSER algorithm. Our structural and functional data clearly indicate an evolutionary link between TsTXKbeta-related peptides and antiparasitic scorpines which both comprise the betaSPN (beta-KTxs and scorpines) family.	2010 Feb	Zhu Shunyi,Gao Bin,Aumelas André,del Carmen Rodríguez Maria,Lanz-Mendoza Humberto,Peigneur Steve,Diego-Garcia Elia,Martin-Eauclaire Marie-France,Tytgat Jan,Possani Lourival D	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1804(4) 872-83	MeuTXK-beta-1	GFREKHFQRFVKYAVPESTLRTVLQTVVHKVGKTQFGCPAYQGYCDDHCQDIEKKEGFCHGFKCKCGIPMGF	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag	A9XE60	Antibiotic, Antimicrobial, Ion channel impairing toxin, Potassium channel impairing toxin, Toxin		8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
20052682	Approaches to efficient production of recombinant angiogenesis inhibitor rhVEGI-192 and characterization of its structure and antiangiogenic function.	Methods to prepare pure, bioactive recombinant human vascular endothelial growth inhibitor (rhVEGI), a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis potentially applicable in antiangiogenic cancer therapy, are in urgent demand for preclinical investigation as well as future clinical trials of the protein. Here, we report expression and purification of rhVEGI-192, a recombinant VEGI isoform, comparatively using host strains BL21 (DE3) pLysS and Origami B (DE3) with IPTG-induction and autoinduction techniques. Our study identified that a combined use of Origami B (DE3) strain and autoinduction expression system gave rise to a high yield of purified rhVEGI-192 at 105.38 mg/L culture by immobilized-metal affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA column. The antiangiogenic activity was effectively restored after the insoluble fractions being dissolved in 8M urea and subsequently subjected to a gradient-dialysis refolding process. Functional tests demonstrated that the purified rhVEGI-192 potently inhibited endothelial growth, induced endothelial apoptosis and suppressed neovascularization in chicken chorioallantoic membrane, indicating that the developed method allows preparation of rhVEGI-192 with high yield, solubility, and bioactivity. Most importantly, our study also demonstrates that VEGI-192 is capable of forming polymeric structure, which is possibly required for its antiangiogenic activity.	2010 Mar	Chen Xu,Wu Jueheng,Liu Hanning,He Zhenjian,Gu Minghui,Wang Ning,Ma Jianda,Hu Jieping,Xia Lei,He Haipeng,Yuan Jie,Li Jun,Li Luyuan,Li Mengfeng,Zhu Xun	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 19(3) 449-57	VEGI-192	MQLTKGRLHFSHPLSHTKHISPFVTDAPLRADGDKPRAHLTVVRQTPTQHFKNQFPALHWEHELGLAFTKNRMNYTNKFLLIPESGDYFIYSQVTFRGMTSECSEIRQAGRPNKPDSITVVITKVTDSYPEPTQLLMGTKSVCEVGSNWFQPIYLGAMFSLQEGDKLMVNVSDISLVDYTKEDKTFFGAFLL	N-terminal His6 tag, Uniprot ID :O95150-2	O95150	Cytokine		6.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
20064618	Preparation and biophysical characterization of recombinant Pseudomonas aeruginosa phosphorylcholine phosphatase.	Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections constitute a widespread health problem with high economical and social impact, and the phosphorylcholine phosphatase (PchP) of this bacterium is a potential target for antimicrobial treatment. However, drug design requires high-resolution structural information and detailed biophysical knowledge not available for PchP. An obstacle in the study of PchP is that current methods for its expression and purification are suboptimal and allowed only a preliminary kinetic characterization of the enzyme. Herein, we describe a new procedure for the efficient preparation of recombinant PchP overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme is purified from urea solubilized inclusion bodies and refolded by dialysis. The product of PchP refolding is a mixture of native PchP and a kinetically-trapped, alternatively-folded aggregate that is very slowly converted into the native state. The properly folded and fully active enzyme is isolated from the refolding mixture by size-exclusion chromatography. PchP prepared by the new procedure was subjected to chemical and biophysical characterization, and its basic optical, hydrodynamic, metal-binding, and catalytic properties are reported. The unfolding of the enzyme was also investigated, and its thermal stability was determined. The obtained information should help to compare PchP with other phosphatases and to obtain a better understanding of its catalytic mechanism. In addition, preliminary trials showed that PchP prepared by the new protocol is suitable for crystallization, opening the way for high-resolution studies of the enzyme structure.	2010 Mar	Beassoni Paola R,Berti Federico Pérez de,Otero Lisandro H,Risso Valeria A,Ferreyra Raul G,Lisa Angela T,Domenech Carlos E,Ermácora Mario R	Protein expression and purification. 71(2) 153-9	phosphorylcholine phosphatase	MTFAKGILAALALAAAVGQASATELEHWPAPAARQLNALIEANANKGAYAVFDMDNTSYRYDLEESLLPYLEMKGVLTRDRLDPSLKLIPFKDQAGHKESLFSYYYRLCEIDDMVCYPWVAQVFSGFTLRELKGYVDELMAYGKPIPATYYDGDKLATLDVEPPRVFSGQRELYNKLMENGIEVYVISAAHEELVRMVAADPRYGYNAKPENVIGVTTLLKNRKTGELTTARKQIAEGKYDPKANLDLEVTPYLWTPATWMAGKQAAILTYIDRWKRPILVAGDTPDSDGYMLFNGTAENGVHLWVNRKAKYMEQINGMIKQHSAAQAKAGLPVTADRNWVIVTPEQIQ		Q9HTR2		full length	8.5		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	t	f	t	f

20084469	A novel fusion protein diphtheria toxin-stem cell factor (DT-SCF)-purification and characterization.	Fusion toxins are an emerging class of targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Diphtheria toxin-stem cell factor (DT-SCF) is one such novel fusion toxin designed to target malignancies expressing c-kit. Since, c-kit overexpression has been reported on many types of cancers, it appeared to be a reasonably good molecule to target. In the present study, we report construction, expression, purification, and characterization of DT-SCF. DT-SCF gene coding for 1-387 amino acids of diphtheria toxin, His-Ala linker, 2-141 amino acids of SCF was cloned into expression vector with C terminal His tag. The induced DT-SCF protein was exclusively expressed in insoluble fraction. Purification of DT-SCF was achieved by inclusion body isolation and metal affinity chromatography under denaturing and reducing conditions. Purified DT-SCF was renatured partially on-column by gradually reducing denaturant concentration followed by complete refolding through rapid dilution technique. Cell viability assay provided the evidence that DT-SCF is a potent cytotoxic agent selective to cells expressing c-kit. The novelty of this study lies in employing SCF as a ligand in construction of fusion toxin to target wide range of malignancies expressing c-kit. Efficacy of DT-SCF fusion toxin was demonstrated over a range of malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukemia (K562), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT4), pancreatic carcinoma (PANC-1), and cervical carcinoma (HeLa 229). This is the first study reporting specificity and efficacy of DT-SCF against tumor cells expressing c-kit. There was significant correlation (P = 0.007) between c-kit expression on cells and their sensitivity to DT-SCF fusion toxin.	2010 Aug	Potala Sirisha,Verma Rama Shanker	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 162(5) 1258-69	diphtheria toxin	GADDVVDS SKSFVMENFS SYHGTKPGYV DSIQKGIQKP KSGTQGNYDD DWKGFYSTDN KYDAAGYSVD NENPLSGKAG GVVKVTYPGL TKVLALKVDN AETIKKELGL SLTEPLMEQV GTEEFIKRFG DGASRVVLSL PFAEGSSSVE YINNWEQAKA LSVELEINFE TRGKRGQDAM YEYMAQACAG NRVRRSVGSS LSCINLDWDV IRDKTKTKIE SLKEHGPIKN KMSESPNKTV SEEKAKQYLE EFHQTALEHP ELSELKTVTG TNPVFAGANY AAWAVNVAQV IDSETADNLE KTTAALSILP GIGSVMGIAD GAVHHNTEEI VAQSIALSSL MVAQAIPLVG ELVDIGFAAY NFVESIINLF QVVHNSYNRP AYSPGHKTQ	33-419 aa, diphtheria toxin-stem cell factor fusion protein with His-Ala linker	P00588	Glycosyltransferase, Toxin, Transferase		8	4	t	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f

20099900	Refolding and characterization of a soluble ectodomain complex of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor.	The calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor is a heterodimer of two membrane proteins: calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1). CLR is a class B G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), possessing a characteristic large amino-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) important for ligand recognition and binding. Dimerization of CLR with RAMP1 provides specificity for CGRP versus related agonists. Here we report the expression, purification, and refolding of a soluble form of the CGRP receptor comprising a heterodimer of the CLR and RAMP1 ECDs. The extracellular protein domains corresponding to residues 23-133 of CLR and residues 26-117 of RAMP1 were shown to be sufficient for formation of a stable, monodisperse complex. The binding affinity of the purified ECD complex for the CGRP peptide was significantly lower than that of the native receptor (IC(50) of 12 microM for the purified ECD complex vs 233 pM for membrane-bound CGRP receptor), indicating that other regions of CLR and/or RAMP1 are important for peptide agonist binding. However, high-affinity binding to known potent and specific nonpeptide antagonists of the CGRP receptor, including olcegepant and telcagepant (K(D) &lt; 0.02 muM), as well as N-terminally truncated peptides and peptide analogues (140 nM to 1.62 microM) was observed.	2010 Mar	Koth Christopher M,Abdul-Manan Norzehan,Lepre Christopher A,Connolly Peter J,Yoo Sanghee,Mohanty Arun K,Lippke Judith A,Zwahlen Jacque,Coll Joyce T,Doran John D,Garcia-Guzman Miguel,Moore Jonathan M	Biochemistry. 49(9) 1862-72	calcitonin receptor-like receptor	ELEESPEDSIQLGVTRNKIMTAQYECYQKIMQDPIQQAEGVYCNRTWDGWLCWNDVAAGTESMQLCPDYFQDFDPSEKVTKICDQDGNWFRHPASNRTWTNYTQCNVNTHE	23-133 aa, heterodimer of the CLR and RAMP1	Q16602	G-protein coupled receptor, Receptor, Transducer	extracellular domain	8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	t	f	f

The lactoferrin cDNA of Kunming mice was isolated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and cloned into vector pET28a(+). Its deduced amino acid sequence was analyzed and compared with lactoferrin of other species. Its secondary and tertiary structure are predicted and modeled by bioinformatics tools online. Then recombinant Kunming mice lactoferrin and its N-lobe were both expressed successfully in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in the form of inclusion bodies. After purification with Ni-NTA His-Bind resin, the yield of recombinant lactoferrin was 17 mg l(-1) with purity of 92.1%, and that of lactoferrin N-lobe was 20 mg l(-1) with purity of 98.5%. The inhibition efficiency of refolded lactoferrin N-lobe against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 reaches 48.6% at the concentration of 25 micromol l(-1). However, the refolded lactoferrin (12.5 micromol l(-1)) didn&#39;t display obvious inhibition activity in the test.

20152902	Escherichia coli expression, refolding and characterization of human laforin.	Laforin is a unique human dual-specificity phosphatase as it contains an amino terminal carbohydrate binding module (CBM). Laforin gene mutations lead to Lafora disease, a progressive myoclonus epilepsy with an early fatal issue. Previous attempts to produce recombinant laforin faced various difficulties, namely the appearance of protein inclusion bodies, the contamination with bacterial proteins and a high tendency of the protein to aggregate, despite the use of fusion tags to improve solubility and ease the purification process. In this work, we have expressed human laforin in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies devoid of any fusion tags. After a rapid dilution refolding step, the protein was purified by two chromatographic steps, yielding 5-7mg of purified protein per liter of bacterial culture. The purified protein was shown to have the kinetic characteristics of a dual-specificity phosphatase, and a functional carbohydrate binding module. With this protocol, we were able for the first time, to produce and purify laforin without fusion tags in the amounts traditionally needed for the crystallographic structural studies paving the way to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of laforin activity and to the development of novel therapies for Lafora disease.	2010 Mar	Castanheira Pedro,Moreira Susana,Gama Miguel,Faro Carlos	Protein expression and purification. 71(2) 195-9	laforin	MRFRFGVVVPPAVAGARPELLVVGSRPELGRWEPRGAVRLRPAGTAAGDGALALQEPGLWLGEVELAAEEAAQDGAEPGRVDTFWYKFLKREPGGELSWEGNGPHHDRCCTYNENNLVDGVYCLPIGHWIEATGHTNEMKHTTDFYFNIAGHQAMHYSRILPNIWLGSCPRQVEHVTIKLKHELGITAVMNFQTEWDIVQNSSGCNRYPEPMTPDTMIKLYREEGLAYIWMPTPDMSTEGRVQMLPQAVCLLHALLEKGHIVYVHCNAGVGRSTAAVCGWLQYVMGWNLRKVQYFLMAKRPAVYIDEEALARAQEDFFQKFGKVRSSVCSL		O95278	Hydrolase, Protein phosphatase	full length	8.0	4	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
20159041	Extraction and purification of human interleukin-10 from transgenic rice seeds.	Recombinant protein production system using transgenic rice grain offers many advantages in higher accumulation, preservation, lower production cost, ease of scale up and low risk of contamination by toxic materials. We developed a transgenic rice strain whose seeds accumulate human interleukin (IL)-10, a cytokine that suppresses inflammation-related immune responses. We also developed a method of extracting and purifying IL-10 from rice seeds. A biochemical crosslinking method was used to detect the biologically active noncovalent dimer of IL-10. This method was useful for developing efficient methods of refolding and purification. The purified IL-10 comprised only noncovalent dimers and showed higher activity than the commercial IL-10. The purified IL-10 had very low endotoxin contamination and is expected to have broad clinical application.	2010 Apr	Fujiwara Yoshihiro,Aiki Yasuhiko,Yang Lijun,Takaiwa Fumio,Kosaka Akemi,Tsuji Noriko M,Shiraki Kentaro,Sekikawa Kenji	Protein expression and purification. 72(1) 125-30	interleukin-10	SPGQGTQSENSCTHFPGNLPNMLRDLRDAFSRVKTFFQMKDQLDNLLLKESLLEDFKGYLGCQALSEMIQFYLEEVMPQAENQDPDIKAHVNSLGENLKTLRLRLRRCHRFLPCENKSKAVEQVKNAFNKLQEKGIYKAMSEFDIFINYIEAYMTMKIRN	C-terminal His6 tag, without signal peptide	Q6FGW4	cytokine		8.5	37.5	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
20174888	Cloning and identification of a novel P-II class snake venom metalloproteinase from Gloydius halys.	Ahpfibrase was a new snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP) which was cloned from Gloydius halys. The cDNA sequence with 1,891 base pairs encodes an open reading frame of 477 amino acids which includes a 17 amino acid signal peptide, plus a 171 amino acid segment of zymogen-like propeptide, a metalloproteinase domain of 200 amino acids, a spacer of 16 amino acids, and a disintegrin-like peptide of 73 amino acids. The metalloproteinase domain contained a conserved signature zinc-binding motif HEXXHXXGXXH in the catalytic region and a methionine-turn CIM. To determine the activity of ahpfibrase, the coding region including both the metalloproteinase domain and disintegrin region was amplified by PCR, inserted into the pET25b(+) vector, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was recovered from inclusion bodies with 8 M urea and refolding was performed by fed-batch dilution method, and purified recombinant ahpfibrase showed the fibrinolytic activity and platelet aggregation-inhibition ability.	2010 Aug	Zhang Shou-Tao,Lu Ping,Qin Yun-Fei,Chen San-Jun,Guo Ai-Guang	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 162(5) 1391-402	snake venom metalloproteinase	AH QRYIELVIVA DHGMFTKYDS NLDTIRTWVH ELVNSINEFY RSLNIDVSLT ELEIWSNEDL INVQPAAPHT LDSFGKWRER DLLHRIHHDN AMLLTAIDFD EPTIGLAYVG TMCNPKGSTG VVQDHSTINL RVAVTMAHEI GHNLGIHHDT GSCSCGGYSC IMSPVISHEP SKYFSDCSYT QCWDFIMNQK PQCILNKPLR TDTVSTPVSG NELLEAGEEC DCGSPGNPCC DAATCKLRQG AQCAEGLCCD QCRFMKKGTV CRIARGDDMD DYCNGISAGC PRNPFHA	189-477 aa	Q1PBD1	Cell adhesion impairing toxin, Hemostasis impairing toxin, Hydrolase, Metalloprotease, Platelet aggregation inhibiting toxin, Protease, Toxin		7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
20175983	Mammalian G protein-coupled receptor expression in Escherichia coli: II. Refolding and biophysical characterization of mouse cannabinoid receptor 1 and human parathyroid hormone receptor 1.	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent approximately 30f the human proteome. They are involved in a large number of diverse processes and, therefore, are the most prominent class of pharmacological targets. Besides rhodopsin, X-ray structures of classical GPCRs have only recently been resolved, including the beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors and the A2A adenosine receptor. This lag in obtaining GPCR structures is due to several tedious steps that are required before beginning the first crystallization experiments: protein expression, detergent solubilization, purification, and stabilization. With the aim to obtain active membrane receptors for functional and crystallization studies, we recently reported a screen of expression conditions for approximately 100 GPCRs in Escherichia coli, providing large amounts of inclusion bodies, a prerequisite for the subsequent refolding step. Here, we report a novel artificial chaperone-assisted refolding procedure adapted for the GPCR inclusion body refolding, followed by protein purification and characterization. The refolding of two selected targets, the mouse cannabinoid receptor 1 (muCB1R) and the human parathyroid hormone receptor 1 (huPTH1R), was achieved from solubilized receptors using detergent and cyclodextrin as protein folding assistants. We could demonstrate excellent affinity of both refolded and purified receptors for their respective ligands. In conclusion, this study suggests that the procedure described here can be widely used to refold GPCRs expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli.	2010 Apr	Michalke Kerstin,Huyghe Céline,Lichière Julie,Gravière Marie-Eve,Siponen Marina,Sciara Giuliano,Lepaul Isabelle,Wagner Renaud,Magg Christine,Rudolph Rainer,Cambillau Christian,Desmyter Aline	Analytical biochemistry. 401(1) 74-80	cannabinoid receptor 1	MKSILDGLADTTFRTITTDLLYVGSNDIQYEDIKGDMASKLGYFPQKFPLTSFRGSPFQEKMTAGDNSPLVPAGDTTNITEFYNKSLSSFKENEDNIQCGENFMDMECFMILNPSQQLAIAVLSLTLGTFTVLENLLVLCVILHSRSLRCRPSYHFIGSLAVADLLGSVIFVYSFVDFHVFHRKDSPNVFLFKLGGVTASFTASVGSLFLTAIDRYISIHRPLAYKRIVTRPKAVVAFCLMWTIAIVIAVLPLLGWNCKKLQSVCSDIFPLIDETYLMFWIGVTSVLLLFIVYAYMYILWKAHSHAVRMIQRGTQKSIIIHTSEDGKVQVTRPDQARMDIRLAKTLVLILVVLIICWGPLLAIMVYDVFGKMNKLIKTVFAFCSMLCLLNSTVNPIIYALRSKDLRHAFRSMFPSCEGTAQPLDNSMGDSDCLHKHANNTASMHRAAESCIKSTVKIAKVTMSVSTDTSAEAL	N-terminal His10 tag	P47746	G-protein coupled receptor, Receptor, Transducer		8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	f

20188759	Expression, purification of the UL3 protein of herpes simplex virus type 1, and production of UL3 polyclonal antibody.	Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is a common pathogen which causes infections of the mucocutaneous membranes. The UL3 protein belongs to a group of HSV-1 late proteins. To date, the function of the UL3 protein in cell culture, animal models, and natural infection is unknown. To investigate further the function of the UL3 protein, this study was undertaken to express the UL3 protein and raise a polyclonal antibody. The UL3 gene was cloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pET-28a (+) to yield pET-28a (+)-UL3. The His6-tagged UL3 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3) cells and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After purification by nickel affinity chromatography and refolding, the recombinant protein was used to raise the anti-UL3 polyclonal antibody. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the UL3 protein was recognized by the polyclonal antibody, and immunofluorescent assay also showed that the antibody was able to recognize the UL3 protein in the cells infected with HSV-1.	2010 May	Lin Fusen,Ren Xiaoming,Guo Hong,Ding Qiong,Zheng Alan C	Journal of virological methods. 166(1-2) 72-6	UL3 protein	MVKPLVSYGSVMSGVGGEGVPSALAILASWGWTFDTPNHESGISPDTTPADSIRGAAVASPDQPLHGGPEREATAPSFSPTRADDGPPCTDGPYVTFDTLFMVSSIDELGRRQLTDTIRKDLRLSLAKFSIACTKTSSFSGNAPRHHRRGAFQRGTRAPRSNKSLQMFVLCKRAHAARVREQLRVVIQSRKPRKYYTRSSDGRLCPAVPVFVHEFVSSEPMRLHRDNVMLASGAE	N-terminal His6 tag	P10187		full length			f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

We expressed recombinant murine growth hormone (rmGH) in E. coli as a cost-effective way to produce large quantities (gram scale) of the protein for use in murine studies of immunogenicity to therapeutic proteins. High hydrostatic pressure was used to achieve high solubility and high refolding yields of rmGH protein produced in E. coli inclusion bodies. A two-step column purification protocol was used to produce 991fb7850ure monomeric rmGH. Secondary and tertiary structures of purified rmGH were investigated using circular dichroism and 2D-UV spectroscopy. The purified rmGH produced was found to be biologically active in hypophysectomized rats.	2010 Jun	Fradkin Amber Haynes,Boand Carl S,Eisenberg Stephen P,Rosendahl Mary S,Randolph Theodore W	Biotechnology progress. 26(3) 743-9	growth hormone	FPAMPLSSLFSNAVLRAQHLHQLAADTYKEFERAYIPEGQRYSIQNAQAAFCFSETIPAPTGKEEAQQRTDMELLRFSLLLIQSWLGPVQFLSRIFTNSLMFGTSDRVYEKLKDLEEGIQALMQELEDGSPRVGQILKQTYDKFDANMRSDDALLKNYGLLSCFKKDLHKAETYLRVMKCRRFVESSCAF	without signal peptide	P06880	Hormone		9.0		f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
20236092	Purification and refolding of Escherichia coli-expressed recombinant human interleukin-2.	The expression of rhIL-2 (recombinant human interleukin-2) in bacteria results in the formation of insoluble inclusion-body aggregates. These aggregates were first solubilized under denaturing conditions (sodium phosphate buffer solution containing 8 M urea and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and then purified using IMAC (immobilized metal-ion-affinity chromatography). IMAC was used to capture rhIL-2. The protein was gradually refolded on the column by a gradient elution (8 M to 0 M urea) in the presence of 10% (v/v) glycerol. Glycerol was used to prevent protein aggregation during the refolding step. Using this method, rhIL-2 was collected at 971fb7850urity and its activity was measured by the lymphocyte transformation test. The measured activity was identical with commercial human interleukin-2.	2010 Apr	Esfandiar Samaneh,Hashemi-Najafabadi Sameereh,Shojaosadati Seyed Abbas,Sarrafzadeh Shokuh Aazam,Pourpak Zahra	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 55(4) 209-14	interleukin-2	APTSSSTKKTQLQLEHLLLDLQMILNGINNYKNPKLTRMLTFKFYMPKKATELKHLQCLEEELKPLEEVLNLAQSKNFHLRPRDLISNINVIVLELKGSETTFMCEYADETATIVEFLNRWITFCQSIISTLT	without signal peptide, C-terminal His6 tag	P60568	Cytokine, Growth factor		7.8	room temperature	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) stimulate bone formation and thus constitute important protein therapeutics. Here, a novel procedure is presented which allows fast and efficient production of biologically active BMP-2 via a TWO-STEP procedure: the conditions are designed such that the first step favors formation of monomeric species with the correct intramolecular disulfide bridges, the conditions of the second folding reaction stimulate the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bridge. The short processing times and increased yields compared to previously published procedures allow low-cost production of this important protein drug.	2010 May	von Einem S,Schwarz E,Rudolph R	Protein expression and purification. 73(1) 65-9	Bone morphogenetic protein-2	QAKHKQRKRLKSSCKRHPLYVDFSDVGWNDWIVAPPGYHAFYCHGECPFPLADHLNSTNHAIVQTLVNSVNSKIPKACCVPTELSAISMLYLDENEKVVLKNYQDMVVEGCGCR	283-396 aa	P12643	Cytokine, Developmental protein, Growth factor		8.3	7	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
20302942	High-yield expression of human vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF(165) in Escherichia coli and purification for therapeutic applications.	Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)) is a potent mitogen that induces angiogenesis and vascular permeability in vivo and has demonstrated potential in therapeutic applications for accelerating wound healing. An industrial production method that provides high yield as well as high purity, quality, and potency is needed. The process described in this report involves a bacterial expression system capable of producing approximately 9g of rhVEGF per liter of broth and a downstream purification process consisting of protein refolding and three chromatography steps prior to formulation of the drug substance. A high cell density (HCD) fed-batch fermentation process was used to produce rhVEGF in periplasmic inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies are harvested from the cell lysate and subjected to a single-step protein solubilization and refolding operation to extract the rhVEGF for purification. Overall recovery yields observed during development, including refolding and chromatography, were 30+/-6%. Host cell impurities are consistently cleared below target levels at both laboratory and large-scale demonstrating process robustness. The structure of the refolded and purified rhVEGF was confirmed by mass spectrometry, N-terminal sequencing, and tryptic peptide mapping while product variants were analyzed by multiple HPLC assays. Biological activity was verified by the proliferation of human umbilical vein derived endothelial cells.	2010 May	Pizarro Shelly A,Gunson Jane,Field Matthew J,Dinges Rachel,Khoo Stefanie,Dalal Milind,Lee Michael,Kaleas Kimberly A,Moiseff Kathryn,Garnick Susan,Reilly Dorothea E,Laird Michael W,Schmelzer Charles H	Protein expression and purification. 72(2) 184-93	VEGF165	APMAEGGGQNHHEVVKFMDVYQRSYCHPIETLVDIFQEYPDEIEYIFKPSCVPLMRCGGCCNDEGLECVPTEESNITMQIMRIKPHQGQHIGEMSFLQHNKCECRPKKDRARQENPCGPCSERRKHLFVQDPQTCKCSCKNTDSRCKARQLELNERTCRCDKPRR	without signal peptide, UniProt ID:P15692-4	P15692	Developmental protein, Growth factor, Mitogen		9.8		f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
20307995	The obese phenotype-inducing N82K mutation in human leptin disrupts receptor-binding and biological activity.	A novel homozygous mutation of the leptin gene was recently reported in an Egyptian child and his sister with severe early onset obesity. This mutation results from the substitution of asparagine (AAC) by lysine (AAA) at codon 103 of a non-mature (signal peptide-containing) leptin and corresponds to the N82K mutation in the mature protein. The patient had very low serum leptin levels, raising the question of whether the obese phenotype resulted from low leptin levels or from its lower intrinsic activity. To answer this question, we characterized the functional consequences of the N82K mutation. Wild-type (WT) human leptin was mutated accordingly, expressed in Escherichia coli at high yield, purified to homogeneity as a monomer and compared to WT human leptin prepared by the same methodology. Circular dichroism analysis of the mutated leptin indicated proper refolding and a secondary structure identical to that of the WT human leptin. In contrast to WT human leptin, the N82K mutant did not form a detectable complex with human leptin-binding domain (hLBD) and its binding capacity to hLBD assessed in a nonradioactive receptor-binding assay was at least 500-fold lower than that of WT human leptin. The biological activity of the N82K mutant, tested in two cell bioassays, was reduced by more than three orders of magnitude relative to WT human leptin. Therefore, though the present report does not explain the reason for the low circulating leptin levels it definitely documents that the reported obese phenotype originates not only from low serum leptin levels but also from the N82K mutant&#39;s almost total lack of intrinsic leptin activity.	2010 May	Niv-Spector Leonora,Shpilman Michal,Grupi Asaf,Gertler Arieh	Molecular genetics and metabolism. 100(2) 193-7	leptin	AVPIQKVQDD TKTLIKTIVT RINDISHTQS VSSKQKVTGL DFIPGLHPIL TLSKMDQTLA VYQQILTSMP SRNVIQISND LENLRDLLHV LAFSKSCHLP WASGLETLDS LGGVLEASGY STEVVALSRL QGSLQDMLWQ LDLSPGC	21-167 aa	P41159	hormone activity		8		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f

Therefore, though the present report does not explain the reason for the low circulating leptin levels it definitely documents that the reported obese phenotype originates not only from low serum leptin levels but also from the N82K mutant&#39;s almost total lack of intrinsic leptin activity.	2010 May	Niv-Spector Leonora,Shpilman Michal,Grupi Asaf,Gertler Arieh	Molecular genetics and metabolism. 100(2) 193-7	leptin	AVPIQKVQDD TKTLIKTIVT RINDISHTQS VSSKQKVTGL DFIPGLHPIL TLSKMDQTLA VYQQILTSMP SRNVIQISND LEKLRDLLHV LAFSKSCHLP WASGLETLDS LGGVLEASGY STEVVALSRL QGSLQDMLWQ LDLSPGC	21-167 aa, N103K mutant	P41159	hormone activity		8		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f
20348246	Tissue distribution and functional analysis of Sushi domain-containing protein 4.	Sushi domain-containing protein 4 (SUSD4) was a hypothetical cell surface protein whose tissue distribution and function were completely unknown. However, recent microarray-based studies have identified deletions of SUSD4 gene in patients with autism or Fryns syndrome, both of which are genetic diseases with severe abnormal neurological development and/or functions. In this article, we described the cloning, expression, refolding, tissue distribution, and functional analysis of this novel protein. Using polyclonal antibodies generated by immunizing chickens with the recombinant SUSD4, we found that SUSD4 is detectable in murine brains, eyes, spinal cords, and testis but not other tissues. In brains, SUSD4 is highly expressed in the white matter on oligodendrocytes/axons, and in eyes, it is exclusively expressed on the photoreceptor outer segments. In in vitro complement assays, SUSD4 augments the alternative but not the classical pathway of complement activation at the C3 convertase step. In in vivo studies, knocking down SUSD4 expression in zebrafish markedly increases ratios of mortality and developmental abnormality. These results provide the first insight into the important physiological roles of SUSD4 and could help to better understand the pathogenesis of autism and Fryns syndrome.	2010 May	Tu Zhidan,Cohen Mark,Bu Hong,Lin Feng	The American journal of pathology. 176(5) 2378-84	Sushi domain-containing protein 4	DLQVCADP GIPENGFRTP SGGVFFEGSV ARFHCQDGFK LKGATKRLCL KHFNGTLGWI PSDNSICVQE DCRIPQIEDA EIHNKTYRHG EKLIITCHEG FKIRYPDLHN MVSLCRDDGT WNNLPICQGC LRPLASSNGY VNISELQTSF PVGTVISYRC FPGFKLDGSA YLECLQNLIW SSSPPRCLAL EVCPLPPMVS HGDFVCHPRP CERYNHGTVV EFYCDPGYSL TSDYKYITCQ YGEWFPSYQV YCIKSE	C-terminal His6 tag, 53-306 aa	Q5VX71		extracellular sushi domains	11.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
20363329	Purification and refolding of recombinant human interferon-gamma in urea-ammonium chloride solution.	A method for purification and refolding of recombinant human interferon-gamma (hIFNgamma) from inclusion bodies is described. It includes the following steps: (i) solubilization of inclusion bodies in 7.4 M guanidinium hydrochloride; (ii) purification of the denatured hIFNgamma by hydrophobic chromatography on Octyl-Sepharose column (one step elution with 6 M urea/1 M ammonium chloride); (iii) refolding of the partly purified protein in 0.75 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.2; (iv) purification of the refolded protein by CM-Sepharose chromatography. The protein thus obtained is characterized by the following general parameters: yield 1.0 mg/g wet cell mass; purity &gt;99%; specific activity 2x10(8)IU/mg; stability - more than two years as a lyophilized powder and more than two months in solution at 4 degrees C.	2010 May	Petrov Stefan,Nacheva Genoveva,Ivanov Ivan	Protein expression and purification. 73(1) 70-3	interferon-gamma	QDPYVKE AENLKKYFNA GHSDVADNGT LFLGILKNWK EESDRKIMQS QIVSFYFKLF KNFKDDQSIQ KSVETIKEDM NVKFFNSNKK KRDDFEKLTN YSVTDLNVQR KAIHELIQVM AELSPAAKTG KRKRSQMLFR GRRASQ	without signal peptide	P01579	Cytokine		8.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
20363330	Recovery of recombinant zebrafish p53 protein from inclusion bodies and its binding activity to p53 mRNA in vitro.	p53 protein is an important regulation factor that can bind to p53 mRNA to regulate its translation in human and murine. To determine if a similar interaction exists in zebrafish and if the interaction affects zebrafish development, we cloned and expressed p53 protein from zebrafish in Escherichia coli. Soluble p53 protein with high purity was successfully obtained using the optimized renaturation approach. Results of a UV-crosslinking experiment and immunoprecipitation:RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the purified p53 protein could bind specifically to its cognate mRNA. Our results suggest that selecting a suitable buffer is important for renaturing p53 protein from inclusion bodies. We also demonstrated a specific interaction between p53 and it own RNA in zebrafish. Measurement of the binding activity may be a useful approach for identifying the activity of recombinant p53 protein in vitro.	2010 May	Zhao Xiangzhong,Liu Ming,Wu Ning,Ding Lili,Liu Haizhou,Lin Xiukun	Protein expression and purification. 72(2) 262-6	p53	MAQNDSQEFAELWEKNLIIQPPGGGSCWDIINDEEYLPGSFDPNFFENVLEEQPQPSTLPPTSTVPETSDYPGDHGFRLRFPQSGTAKSVTCTYSPDLNKLFCQLAKTCPVQMVVDVAPPQGSVVRATAIYKKSEHVAEVVRRCPHHERTPDGDNLAPAGHLIRVEGNQRANYREDNITLRHSVFVPYEAPQLGAEWTTVLLNYMCNSSCMGGMNRRPILTIITLETQEGQLLGRRSFEVRVCACPGRDRKTEESNFKKDQETKTMAKTTTGTKRSLVKESSSATLRPEGSKKAKGSSSDEEIFTLQVRGRERYEILKKLNDSLELSDVVPASDAEKYRQKFMTKNKKENRESSEPKQGKKLMVKDEGRSDSD	N-terminal His6 tag	P79734	Activator	full length	8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
20363333	High-efficient expression, refolding and purification of functional recombinant C-terminal fragment of human alpha-fetoprotein.	Human alpha-fetoprotein (hAFP) is an oncofetal protein which is a common cancer marker. Conjugates of native hAFP with different cytostatic agents inhibit growth of cancer cells in vivo and in vitro. The hAFP interacts with its receptor (AFPR) on the surface of cancer cells via its C-terminal domain. The aim of this work was to develop a highly efficient expression system in Escherichia coli and efficient refolding procedure for the recombinant C-terminal fragment of hAFP (rAFP-Cterm) and to characterize its functional properties. C-terminal fragment of hAFP (rAFP-Cterm) comprising amino acids from 404 to 609 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain with high yield. High efficient purification and refolding procedures were developed giving yield of refolded protein about 80% with purity about 95%. The refolded rAFP-Cterm bound specifically with cancer cells carrying AFPR and was accumulated by them with the same efficiency as native hAFP. This rAFP-Cterm can be used as a vehicle for the targeted delivery of drugs to cancer cells.	2010 May	Sharapova Olga A,Pozdnykova Natalia V,Laurinavichyute Daniela K,Yurkova Maria S,Posypanova Galina A,Fedorov Alexey N,Severin Sergey E,Severin Evgeny S	Protein expression and purification. 73(1) 31-5	alpha-fetoprotein	YIQESQA LAKRSCGLFQ KLGEYYLQNA FLVAYTKKAP QLTSSELMAI TRKMAATAAT CCQLSEDKLL ACGEGAADII IGHLCIRHEM TPVNPGVGQC CTSSYANRRP CFSSLVVDET YVPPAFSDDK FIFHKDLCQA QGVALQTMKQ EFLINLVKQK PQITEEQLEA VIADFSGLLE KCCQGQEQEV CFAEEGQKLI SKTRAALGV	404-609 aa, C-terminal His7 tag	P02771	metal ion binding	C-terminal fragment	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
20407270	Recombinant fusion proteins assembling Der p 1 and Der p 2 allergens from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.	BACKGROUND:Fusion proteins assembling multiple allergens can be engineered by recombinant DNA technologies in order to produce tools for diagnostic and immunotherapeutic purposes. Herein, we developed and characterized chimeras assembling Der p 1 and Der p 2 allergens as potential candidate vaccines against house dust mite allergy.METHODS:Fusion proteins encompassing Der p 2 with either mature or proDer p 1 were expressed in Escherichia coli or Pichia pastoris. Forms with mutation in Der p 1 catalytic site were also engineered. Purified chimeras were characterized by immunoblotting, circular dichroism, disulfide bond mapping, basophil and T lymphocyte stimulation assays.RESULTS:Four fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies, whereas only chimeras comprising proDer p 1 were obtained in yeast. All such hybrids formed polymers and aggregates, and yeast-expressed chimeras were unstable. Circular dichroism analysis performed after refolding of bacteria expressed chimeras encompassing mature Der p 1 confirmed partial folding, consistent with the occurrence of both correct and inappropriate intramolecular disulfide bonds. All fusion molecules were recognized by Der p 1- and Der p 2-specific human IgEs, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Fusion proteins activate basophils from mite-allergic patients and trigger the proliferation of specific CD4+ T cells, albeit to a lower level when compared to individual allergens.CONCLUSIONS:Production of multiple Der p 1-Der p 2 fusion proteins exhibiting partial folding and proper antigenic properties has been achieved.

20419499	Sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase from echiuran worm Urechis unicinctus.	Sulfide is a natural, widely distributed, poisonous substance, and sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) has been identified to be responsible for the initial oxidation of sulfide in mitochondria. In this study, full-length SQR cDNA was cloned from the echiuran worm Urechis unicinctus, a benthic organism living in marine sediments. The protein consisted of 451 amino acids with a theoretical pI of 8.98 and molecular weight of 50.5 kDa. Subsequently, the SQR mRNA expression in different tissues was assessed by real-time reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction and showed that the highest expression was in midgut, followed by anal sacs and coelomic fluid cells, and then body wall and hindgut. Furthermore, activated SQR was obtained by dilution refolding of recombinant SQR expression in E. coli, and the refolded product showed optimal activity at 37 °C and pH 8.5 and K (m) for ubiquinone and sulfide at 15.6 µM and 40.3 µM, respectively. EDTA and GSH had an activating effect on refolded SQR, while Zn(2+) caused decreased activity. Western blot showed that SQR in vivo was located in mitochondria and was ∼ 10 kDa heavier than the recombinant protein. In addition, SQR, detected by immunohistochemistry, was mainly located in the epithelium of all tissues examined. Ultrastructural observations of these tissues&#39; epithelium by transmission electron microscopy provided indirect cytological evidence for its mitochondrial location. Interesting aspects of the U. unicinctus SQR amino acid sequence, its catalytic mechanism, and the different roles of these tissues in sulfide metabolic adaptation are also discussed.	2011 Mar	Ma Yu-Bin,Zhang Zhi-Feng,Shao Ming-Yu,Kang Kyoung-Ho,Tan Zhi,Li Jin-Long	Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.). 13(1) 93-107	Sulfide:quinone Oxidoreductase	MACTRTVFLRLSCSVRDKWSPKALGCQVAWFSSSPAREQQEKKYDIVIVGGGCAGSAIANKFAPYLGQGKVAVVEPHETHYYQPMFTLVGAGIKDHKQTHTQTKDVLPDECDWIKDKVTSFDPNNNSVTTAGGDKLKYDYLLVSMGLQLNYHSVKGLEEALKEDPAVCSNYHWQHVKKTHPAIENIQSGNAIFTFPNTPVKCAGAPQKICYLAENNFSKAGKRDRINVMYNTSLPVIFGIPRYAAPLEEICKNRNITVNKRHNLVEVDHKNNRAVFQLLDTPTENVSFEYSMLHVSPPMSSPKELWGSSLVDETNFVTVNRDTLQHTKYPNVFGMGDCTNAPTAKTAAAISAQVGVVNKNLSLVMDGKQPTRKYDGYTSCPLLVGNHKVIMAEFGYDGSILETFPINQAKAMRSMYFMKVHFMPQLYWQMLVKGLWHGPGFFRKLFRFGVA	N-terminal His6 tag	H2KXA2	oxidoreductase	full length	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
20450943	Refolding of the recombinant protein OmpA70 from Leptospira interrogans from inclusion bodies using high hydrostatic pressure and partial characterization of its immunological properties.	Leptospira is the etiological agent of leptospirosis, a life-threatening disease that affects human populations worldwide. Available vaccines have demonstrated limited effectiveness, and therapeutic interventions are complicated by the difficulty of establishing an early diagnosis. The genome of Leptospira strains was sequenced, and bioinformatic analyses revealed potential vaccine and serodiagnosis candidates. The present work studied OmpA70, a putative outer membrane protein from Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni that combines structural features of Loa22, the first genetically defined virulence factor in Leptospira, and Lp49, a protein that reacts with sera from early and convalescent patients. Recombinant OmpA was produced in Escherichia coli in an insoluble form. Considering the importance of the structural integrity of a protein to confer immune protection, high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) was used to refold OmpA70 aggregated as inclusion bodies. HHP was applied in association with redox-shuffling reagents (oxidized and reduced glutathione) and guanidine hydrochloride or l-arginine. About 400f the protein was refolded by applying 200MPa for 16h in concentrations of l-arginine above 0.4M. Circular dichroism revealed the presence of secondary structure. OmpA70 has immunogenic and antigenic properties as high antibody titers were seen after immunization with this protein, and sera from infected hamsters reacted with soluble OmpA70.	2010 Jul	Fraga Tatiana R,Chura-Chambi Rosa M,Gonçales Amane P,Morais Zenaide M,Vasconcellos Sílvio A,Morganti Ligia,Martins Elizabeth A L	Journal of biotechnology. 148(2-3) 156-62	OmpA70	MHTLLTLILSLLLFSGLQSENKNSSSKKLSDSASWIPKENFTQLASQREKFKNVSHNETLKLEIGYKLLTGKILQFGKLLSTENAYVPIESNEITSELSQLNDKTVRILCSMKGSTCNPIRYEIYPFWDSKEIKPWTIKKIPDYVNHNIFAFNPTVSPDGKYLFWTAYVKRGKSGTQKIWYSKLDEKGFWEDGKEMNAPLNNEMPSAVISALPGGNELFVFGTFGEKELLDELSKDFETKADLAARSSKNSNVYRKKIEELRAEYDEKTKQISSRVPLYKSFKEKDSWSKPSILNFPNFYNLYRKRNDSSQEIFGGSTLSSSGRILIYSSQHKDSKGKLDLYVSKMLNDGTFPLGTNLGDVINTTHEEMAPFLASDDRTLYFSSDGHKGLSIYMTKRIGEGWDQWTKPVEVSENLKGVNFFSIPANSDWAYISKDGRLFMAYLPKEMRPEKVVIINGKVLDTDGNPLSADIHYESLKSHEKIGSAKSDPSNGNFSIILPFGENYGFYAQKKGYLPVSQNLNLSSKKKFSEKVEVILQLPPIRERGSIQINNLFFESKSFQIAPESAPELDRLAEIVKENPDIEIQIEGHTDNIGKKKDNLILSEKRAAAVAEYLFQKHSISKTRIQTKGFGDSVPLSKNDSEEARKKNRRVNFTILKKSK	N-terminal His6 tag	Q72UX0		full length	8.0		f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f
20467833	Expression, high cell density culture and purification of recombinant EC-SOD in Escherichia coli.	Superoxide dismutase (SOD) catalyzes the dismutation of the biologically toxic superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide and is deployed by the immune system to kill invading microorganisms. Extracellular SOD (EC-SOD) is a copper- and zinc-containing glycoprotein found predominantly in the soluble extracellular compartment that consists of approximately 30-kDa subunits. Here, we purified recombinant EC-SOD3 (rEC-SOD) from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) expressing a pET-SOD3-1 construct. Cells were cultured by high-density fed-batch fermentation to a final OD(600) of 51.8, yielding a final dry cell weight of 17.6 g/L. rEC-SOD, which was expressed as an inclusion body, comprised 48.70f total protein. rEC-SOD was refolded by a simple dilution refolding method and purified by cation-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography. The highly purified rEC-SOD thus obtained was a mixture of monomers and dimers, both of which were active. The molecular weights of monomeric and dimeric rEC-SOD were 25,255 and 50,514 Da, respectively. The purified rEC-SOD had 4.3 EU/mg of endotoxin and the solubility of rEC-SOD was more than 800etween pH 7 and 10. In 2 L of fed-batch fermentation, 60 mg of EC-SOD (99.91fb7850urity) could be produced and total activity was 330.24 U. The process established in this report, involving high-cell-density fermentation, simple dilution refolding, and purification with ion-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography, represents a commercially viable process for producing rEC-SOD.	2010 Aug	Son Young-Jin,Bae Ji-Young,Chong Seon-Ha,Lee Hui Sun,Mo Sang Hyun,Kim Tae Yoon,Choe Han	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 162(6) 1585-98	EC-SOD3	WT GEDSAEPNSD SAEWIRDMYA KVTEIWQEVM QRRDDDGALH AACQVQPSAT LDAAQPRVTG VVLFRQLAPR AKLDAFFALE GFPTEPNSSS RAIHVHQFGD LSQGCESTGP HYNPLAVPHP QHPGDFGNFA VRDGSLWRYR AGLAASLAGP HSIVGRAVVV HAGEDDLGRG GNQASVENGN AGRRLACCVV GVCGPGLWER QAREHSE	19-227 aa, N-terminal His8 tag	P08294	Antioxidant, Oxidoreductase		10.6	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
20473714	High-yield production, refolding and a molecular modelling of the catalytic module of (1,3)-beta-D-glucan (curdlan) synthase from Agrobacterium sp.	Biosynthesis of the (1,3)-beta-D: -glucan (curdlan) in Agrobacterium sp., is believed to proceed by the repetitive addition of glucosyl residues from UDP-glucose by a membrane-embedded curdlan synthase (CrdS) [UDP-glucose: (1,3)-beta-D: -glucan 3-beta-D: -glucosyltransferase; EC 2.4.1.34]. The catalytic module of CrdS (cm-CrdS) was expressed in good yield from a cDNA encoding cm-CrdS cloned into the pET-32a(+) vector, containing a coding region for thioredoxin, and from the Champion pET SUMO system that possesses a coding region of a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) partner protein. The two DNA fusions, designated pET-32a_cm-CrdS and SUMO_cm-CrdS were expressed as chimeric proteins. High yields of inclusion bodies were produced in E. coli and these could be refolded to form soluble proteins, using a range of buffers and non-detergent sulfobetaines. A purification protocol was developed, which afforded a one-step on-column refolding and simultaneous purification of the recombinant 6xHis-tagged SUMO_cm-CrdS protein. The latter protein was digested by a specific protease to yield intact cm-CrdS in high yields. The refolded SUMO_cm-CrdS protein did not exhibit curdlan synthase activity, but showed a circular dischroism spectrum, which had an alpha/beta-type-like conformation. Amino acid sequences of tryptic fragments of the SUMO_cm-CrdS fusion and free cm-CrdS proteins, determined by MALDI/TOF confirmed that the full-length proteins were synthesized by E. coli, and that no alterations in amino acid sequences occurred. A three-dimensional model of cm-CrdS predicted the juxtaposition of highly conserved aspartates D156, D208, D210 and D304, and the QRTRW motif, which are likely to play roles in donor and acceptor substrate binding and catalysis.	2010 May	Hrmova Maria,Stone Bruce A,Fincher Geoffrey B	Glycoconjugate journal. 27(4) 461-76	catalytic module of curdlan synthase	RRTDW SAVADQGEAY LAGNPHAPLV DVFICTYNEP LNVLEKSIIA AQAMDYPRLR VFVCDDTRRG EVRTYCEAVG VNYVTRPDNK HAKAGNLNNA LLHTNALEEV SDFIMVLDAD FAPQANFLRR VTGLFSDPKV AVVQTPQFYF NSDPIQHNLG IDKSFVDDQR VFFDVFQPAK DAVGCAFCVG TSFVVRRAAV NGIGGFPSDA LSEDMLLTYR LMERGYVTRW LNEKLSVGLS AEGVPEYITQ RTRWCLGTIQ IGLLRTGPLW RGNFTLTQRL HYLHGL	96-376 aa, N-terminal His6 and SUMO tag	F5J9M5	cellulose synthase		8	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
20512388	Expression and purification of antimicrobial peptide CM4 by Npro fusion technology in E. coli.	Antimicrobial peptide CM4 is a small cationic peptide with broad-spectrum activities against bacteria, fungi, and tumor cells. Different strategies have been developed to produce small antibacterial peptides using recombinant techniques. To date, no efforts to obtain large quantities of active recombinant CM4 have been reported. In order to establish a bacterium-based CM4 production system, CM4 was cloned into pET28a and expressed with Npro mutant (EDDIE) fusion. CM4 expressed as EDDIE are deposited as inclusion bodies. On in vitro refolding by switching from chemotropic to kosmotropic conditions, the fusion partner is released from the C-terminal end of the autoprotease by self-cleavage, leaving CM4 protein with an authentic N terminus. Purified CM4 was separated on Ni2+-chelating chromatography column and cation-exchange chromatography column. Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated the protein to be 4132.56 Dalton, which equalled the theoretically expected mass. N-terminal sequencing of CM4 showed the sequence corresponded to the native protein. The recombinant CM4 exhibited the same antimicrobial and anti-tumor activity as reported previously. The expression strategy presented in this study allows convenient high yield and easy purification of recombinant CM4 with native sequences.	2010 Oct	Cheng Xiawei,Lu Wuguang,Zhang Shuangquan,Cao Peng	Amino acids. 39(5) 1545-52	antimicrobial peptide CM4	RWKIFKKIEK VGQNIRDGIV KAGPAVAVVG QAATI	N-terminal His6 and EDDIE tag	P14666	Antibiotic, Antimicrobial	full length	9	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
20527875	Reconstitution of Helicobacter pylori VacA toxin from purified components.	Helicobacter pylori VacA is a pore-forming toxin that causes multiple alterations in human cells and contributes to the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. The toxin is secreted by H. pylori as an 88 kDa monomer (p88) consisting of two domains (p33 and p55). While an X-ray crystal structure for p55 exists and p88 oligomers have been visualized by cryo-electron microscopy, a detailed analysis of p33 has been hindered by an inability to purify this domain in an active form. In this study, we expressed and purified a recombinant form of p33 under denaturing conditions and optimized conditions for the refolding of the soluble protein. We show that refolded p33 can be added to purified p55 in trans to cause vacuolation of HeLa cells and inhibition of IL-2 production by Jurkat cells, effects identical to those produced by the p88 toxin from H. pylori. The p33 protein markedly enhances the cell binding properties of p55. Size exclusion chromatography experiments suggest that p33 and p55 assemble into a complex consistent with the size of a p88 monomer. Electron microscopy of these p33/p55 complexes reveals small rod-shaped structures that can convert to oligomeric flower-shaped structures in the presence of detergent. We propose that the oligomerization observed in these experiments mimics the process by which VacA oligomerizes when in contact with membranes of host cells.	2010 Jul	González-Rivera Christian,Gangwer Kelly A,McClain Mark S,Eli Ilyas M,Chambers Melissa G,Ohi Melanie D,Lacy D Borden,Cover Timothy L	Biochemistry. 49(27) 5743-52	vacuolating cytotoxin	AFFTT LGWGLKQAEE ANKTPDKPDK VWRIQAGKGF NEFPNKEYDL YKSLLSSKID GGWDWGNAAT HYWIKGGQWN KLEVDMKDAV GTYKLSGLRN FTGGDLDVNM QKATLRLGQF NGNSFTSYKD SADRTTRVDF NAKNILIDNF LEINNRVGSG AGRKASSTVL TLQASEGITS SKNAEISLYD GATLNLASNS VKLNGNVWMG RLQYVGAYLA PSYSTINTSK VTGEVNFNHL TVGDHNAAQA GIIASNKTHI GTLDLWQSAG LNIIAPPEGG YKDKPNNTPS QSGAK	34-345 aa, 39-60 aa deletion mutant, N-terminal c-Myc tag, C-terminal His6 tag	Q48245	Toxin	N-terminal p33 domain	8.2		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
20538591	Stabilization of HIV-1 gp120-CD4 receptor complex through targeted interchain disulfide exchange.	HIV-1 enters cells via interaction between the trimeric envelope (Env) glycoprotein gp120/gp41 and the host cell surface receptor molecule CD4. The requirement of CD4 for viral entry has rationalized the development of recombinant CD4-based proteins as competitive viral attachment inhibitors and immunotherapeutic agents. In this study, we describe a novel recombinant CD4 protein designed to bind gp120 through a targeted disulfide-exchange mechanism. According to structural models of the gp120-CD4 receptor complex, substitution of Ser(60) on the CD4 domain 1 alpha-helix with Cys positions a thiol in proximity of the gp120 V1/V2 loop disulfide (Cys(126)-Cys(196)), satisfying the stereochemical and geometric conditions for redox exchange between CD4 Cys(60) and gp120 Cys(126), and the consequent formation of an interchain disulfide bond. In this study, we provide experimental evidence for this effect by describing the expression, purification, refolding, receptor binding and antiviral activity analysis of a recombinant two-domain CD4 variant containing the S60C mutation (2dCD4-S60C). We show that 2dCD4-S60C binds HIV-1 gp120 with a significantly higher affinity than wild-type protein under conditions that facilitate disulfide exchange and that this translates into a corresponding increase in the efficacy of CD4-mediated viral entry inhibition. We propose that targeted redox exchange between conserved gp120 disulfides and nucleophilic moieties positioned strategically on CD4 (or CD4-like scaffolds) conceptualizes a new strategy in the development of high affinity HIV-1 Env ligands, with important implications for therapy and vaccine development. More generally, this chalcogen substitution approach provides a general means of stabilizing receptor-ligand complexes where the structural and biophysical conditions for disulfide exchange are satisfied.	2010 Aug	Cerutti Nichole,Mendelow Barry V,Napier Grant B,Papathanasopoulos Maria A,Killick Mark,Khati Makobetsa,Stevens Wendy,Capovilla Alexio	The Journal of biological chemistry. 285(33) 25743-52	CD4	KKVVL GKKGDTVELT CTASQKKSIQ FHWKNSNQIK ILGNQGSFLT KGPSKLNDRA DSRRSLWDQG NFPLIIKNLK IEDSDTYICE VEDQKEEVQL LVFGLTANSD THLLQGQSLT LTLESPPGSS PSVQCRSPRG KNIQGGKTLS VSQLELQDSG TWTCTVLQNQ KKVEFKIDIV VLAFQKAS	26-208 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	P01730	Host cell receptor for virus entry, Receptor		9.6	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

20546308	Recombinant tetrathionate hydrolase from Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans requires exposure to acidic conditions for proper folding.	Tetrathionate hydrolase (4THase) plays an important role in dissimilatory sulfur metabolism in the acidophilic chemolithoautotrophic iron- and sulfur-oxidizing bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. We have already identified the gene encoding 4THase (Af-tth) in this bacterium. The heterologous expression of Af-tth in Escherichia coli resulted in the formation of inclusion bodies of the protein in an inactive form. The recombinant protein (Af-Tth) was successfully activated after an in vitro refolding treatment. The specific activity of the refolded Af-Tth obtained was 21.0+/-9.4 U mg(-1) when the protein solubilized from inclusion bodies by 6 M guanidine hydrochloride solution was refolded in a buffer containing 10 mM beta-alanine, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.4 M ammonium sulfate, and 30% v/v glycerol with the pH adjusted to 4.0 by sulfuric acid for 14 h at 4 degrees C. The in vitro refolding experiments revealed that Af-Tth required exposure to an acidic environment during protein folding for activation. This property reflects a physiological characteristic of the Af-Tth localized in the outer membrane of the acidophilic A. ferrooxidans. No cofactor such as pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) was required during the refolding process in spite of the similarity in the primary structure of Af-Tth to the PQQ family of proteins.	2010 Jul	Kanao Tadayoshi,Matsumoto Chie,Shiraga Kumiko,Yoshida Kyoya,Takada Jun,Kamimura Kazuo	FEMS microbiology letters. 309(1) 43-7	tetrathionate hydrolase	AVAVPMDSTGPYRTVSHPENAPSGVDAGVGPSEWTHAYANPAHNAAFPVPDDAPEWIRNGVSWLFPEARAWPLANPPFGSKTYGAAEASVTQTQFYGNALGPSVVDGVVYAESDDMFAYAVNAKTGKLIWRASPVGNNLMGNPLVIGNTVYLSAGSVAFNFANVLRYAHNPSASARGLNVSFNGIYALNRSNGKLLWYFATPGETMATPAYDNNTLFIADGAGNAFGINATTGKQVWKTHVGGMDNMSSVTAYRHNIYFAMAIKPYLYCLNESNGHIVWKGTIPGASNTGIGDVSPAAADGVVVLDATTKPQANKKAMFSNVIRAFDAKTGAVLWTRNMGSGGKIPAFKGGVPMIHNNIVYVGNPVASTYQAYELKTGKLLWTWHVPTKVAAGAGRSAPTYYKGLLYITTGQYIFVVNPATGKELHQHHIGGQFGIESPVIVGGTVYLTNSWDWIMAIPLKTISHGS	without signal peptide	B7J3C9	hydrolase		4.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
20564039	Identification of a potential modification site in human stromal cell-derived factor-1.	Selective modification of proteins is an important tool to study their function. However, it is still challenging to identify the best position to avoid a loss of activity. By using a 6-nitroveratryl (Nvoc)-modification approach, we facilitate the identification of a potential modification site as Nvoc can be removed in situ by UV irradiation and accordingly allows directly the comparison of the biological activity of the modified and the unmodified protein derived from the same precursor. As a test system, we used stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), which is involved in a wide range of physiological functions, mainly hematopoiesis and embryonic organ development. This chemokine is a potential candidate in regenerative medicine because of its capability to attract stem cells to distinct localizations. First, we synthesized the wildtype and the Nvoc-modified C-terminal segments SDF-1(50-68) and studied their secondary structure formation by circular dichroism spectroscopy. By using the intein-mediated purification with a affinity chitin binding tag system, we then expressed the peptide thioester M-[A(49)]-SDF-1(1-49)-MESNA recombinantly, in which the valine at position 49 was replaced by a more suitable alanine residue to allow improved cleavage and ligation. After ligation and refolding, the biological activity was proven in a cell-based inositol phosphate accumulation assay prior and after Nvoc removal, which showed that neither the alanine 49 nor the attached Nvoc group impair the activity of the analog. The study shows that lysine 56 is a potential site to introduce labels site-specifically in SDF-1.	2010 Nov	Baumann Lars,Beck-Sickinger Annette G	Biopolymers. 94(6) 771-8	stromal cell-derived factor-1	KPVSLSYRCPCRFFESHVARANVKHLKILNTPNCALQIVARLKNNNRQVCIDPKLKWIQEYLEKALNK	Uniprot ID:P48061-2, without signal peptide, V70A mutant, K77 is modified by 6-nitroveratryl(Nvoc)	P48061	Cytokine, Growth factor		8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
20600946	Expression of the functional carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of human laforin.	Laforin is a human protein associated with the glycogen metabolism, composed of two structurally and functionally independent domains: a phosphatase catalytic domain and a substrate-binding module with glycogen and starch affinity. The main goal of this work is the development of a methodology for the expression of the so far poorly characterized carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) of laforin, allowing its study and development of biomedical applications. The laforin&#39;s CBM sequence was originally cloned by PCR from a human muscle cDNA library. The recombinant protein, containing laforin&#39;s CBM fused to an Arg-Gly-Asp sequence (RGD), was cloned and expressed using vector pET29a and recovered as inclusion bodies (IBs). Refolding of the IBs allowed the purification of soluble, dimeric and functional protein, according to adsorption assays using starch and glycogen. Several other experimental approaches, using both bacteria and yeast, were unsuccessfully tested, pointing towards the difficulties in producing the heterologous protein. Indeed, this is the first work reporting the production of the functional CBM from human laforin.	2010 Oct	Moreira Susana,Castanheira Pedro,Casal Margarida,Faro Carlos,Gama Miguel	Protein expression and purification. 74(2) 169-74	laforin	MRFRFGVVVP PAVAGARPEL LVVGSRPELG RWEPRGAVRL RPAGTAAGDG ALALQEPGLW LGEVELAAEE AAQDGAEPGR VDTFWYKFLK REPGGELSWE GNGPHHDRCC TYNENNLVDG VYCLPIGHWI EATGHTNEMK HTTDFYFNIA GHQ	1-153 aa, C-terminal additional TGD tripeptide, C-terminal His6 tag	O95278	Hydrolase, Protein phosphatase	carbohydrate-binding module	8.0	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
20600948	Expression, purification, and refolding of active Nrf2 transcription factor fused to protein transduction TAT tag.	Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor responsible for activation of diverse genes that protect the cell against xenobiotics and oxidative stress. The Nrf2-dependent transcription is tightly controlled by cytoplasmic interaction of Nrf2 with its inhibitor, Kelch ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1). The Keap1-mediated inhibition can be overcome by addition of xenobiotics or by overexpression of Nrf2 protein. The overexpressed Nrf2 overwhelms the Keap1 inhibition, translocates into the nucleus and activates antioxidant response element (ARE)-dependent gene transcription that protects the cell against oxidative stress. We expressed and purified recombinant mouse Nrf2 protein fused to a protein transduction domain (TAT), derived from transactivator of transcription protein from HIV-1. Full-length TAT-Nrf2 was expressed in Escherichia coli in insoluble inclusion bodies and purified to homogeneity using denaturing size exclusion chromatography. Optimal refolding conditions were determined through the use of a light scattering-based refolding assay and analytical size exclusion chromatography. The results demonstrate that the refolded TAT-Nrf2 could transduce into cultured human neuroblastoma cells. The transduced TAT-Nrf2 activated transcription of ARE-dependent genes and conferred protection against intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by hydrogen peroxide exposure.	2010 Oct	Chumanov Robert S,Burgess Richard R	Protein expression and purification. 74(2) 280-8	Nrf2	MMDLELPPPGLQSQQDMDLIDILWRQDIDLGVSREVFDFSQRQKDYELEKQKKLEKERQEQLQKEQEKAFFAQFQLDEETGEFLPIQPAQHIQTDTSGSASYSQVAHIPKQDALYFEDCMQLLAETFPFVDDHESLALDIPSHAESSVFTAPHQAQSLNSSLEAAMTDLSSIEQDMEQVWQELFSIPELQCLNTENKQLADTTAVPSPEATLTEMDSNYHFYSSISSLEKEVGNCGPHFLHGFEDSFSSILSTDDASQLTSLDSNPTLNTDFGDEFYSAFIAEPSDGGSMPSSAAISQSLSELLDGTIEGCDLSLCKAFNPKHAEGTMEFNDSDSGISLNTSPSRASPEHSVESSIYGDPPPGFSDSEMEELDSAPGSVKQNGPKAQPAHSPGDTVQPLSPAQGHSAPMRESQCENTTKKEVPVSPGHQKAPFTKDKHSSRLEAHLTRDELRAKALHIPFPVEKIINLPVDDFNEMMSKEQFNEAQLALIRDIRRRGKNKVAAQNCRKRKLENIVELEQDLGHLKDEREKLLREKGENDRNLHLLKRRLSTLYLEVFSMLRDEDGKPYSPSEYSLQQTRDGNVFLVPKSKKPDTKKN	N-terminal His6 tag, TAT tag, and HA tag	Q60795	transcriptional activator	full length	7.9	22	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
20634959	Properly folded bacterially expressed H1N1 hemagglutinin globular head and ectodomain vaccines protect ferrets against H1N1 pandemic influenza virus.	BACKGROUND:In the face of impending influenza pandemic, a rapid vaccine production and mass vaccination is the most effective approach to prevent the large scale mortality and morbidity that was associated with the 1918 &quot;Spanish Flu&quot;. The traditional process of influenza vaccine production in eggs is time consuming and may not meet the demands of rapid global vaccination required to curtail influenza pandemic.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Recombinant technology can be used to express the hemagglutinin (HA) of the emerging new influenza strain in a variety of systems including mammalian, insect, and bacterial cells. In this study, two forms of HA proteins derived from the currently circulating novel H1N1 A/California/07/2009 virus, HA1 (1-330) and HA (1-480), were expressed and purified from E. coli under controlled redox refolding conditions that favoured proper protein folding. However, only the recombinant HA1 (1-330) protein formed oligomers, including functional trimers that bound receptor and caused agglutination of human red blood cells. These proteins were used to vaccinate ferrets prior to challenge with the A/California/07/2009 virus. Both proteins induced neutralizing antibodies, and reduced viral loads in nasal washes. However, the HA1 (1-330) protein that had higher content of multimeric forms provided better protection from fever and weight loss at a lower vaccine dose compared with HA (1-480). Protein yield for the HA1 (1-330) ranged around 40 mg/Liter, while the HA (1-480) yield was 0.4-0.8 mg/Liter.CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:This is the first study that describes production in bacterial system of properly folded functional globular HA1 domain trimers, lacking the HA2 transmembrane protein, that elicit potent neutralizing antibody responses following vaccination and protect ferrets from in vivo challenge. The combination of bacterial expression system with established quality control methods could provide a mechanism for rapid large scale production of influenza vaccines in the face of influenza pandemic threat.	2010 Jul	Khurana Surender,Verma Swati,Verma Nitin,Crevar Corey J,Carter Donald M,Manischewitz Jody,King Lisa R,Ross Ted M,Golding Hana	PloS one. 5(7) e11548	Hemagglutinin	EDKHNGKLCK LRGVAPLHLG KCNIAGWILG NPECESLSTA SSWSYIVETP SSDNGTCYPG DFIDYEELRE QLSSVSSFER FEIFPKTSSW PNHDSNKGVT AACPHAGAKS FYKNLIWLVK KGDSYPKLSK SYINDKGKEV LVLWGIHHPS TSADQQSLYQ NADAYVFVGS SRYSKKFKPE IAIRPKVRDQ EGRMNYYWTL VEPGDKITFE ATGNLVVPRY AFAMERNAGS GIIISDTPVH DCNTTCQTPK GAINTSLPFQ NIHPITIGKC PKYVKSTKLR LATGLRNIPS IQSRGLFGAI AGFIEGGWTG MVDGWYGYHH QNEQGSGYAA	1-330 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	U3M8B4	Hemagglutinin				t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f

20674388	Expression, refolding and purification of a human interleukin-17A variant.	A human interleukin-17A (IL-17A) variant was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) under the control of a T(7) promoter. The resulting insoluble inclusion bodies were isolated and solubilized by homogenization with 6 M guanidine HCl. The denatured recombinant human IL-17A variant was refolded in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 500 mM arginine, 500 mM guanidine HCl, 15 0lycerol, 1 mM cystamine, and 5 mM cysteine at 2-8°C for 40 h. The refolded IL-17A variant was subsequently purified using a combination of cation-exchange, reversed-phase and fluoroapatite chromatography. The final purified product was a monodisperse and crystallizable homodimer with a molecular weight of 30,348.3 Da. The protein was active in both receptor binding competition assay and IL-17A-dependent biological activity assay using human dermal fibroblasts.	2010 Nov	Wu Bingyuan,Nemeth Jennifer F,Janecki Dariusz J,Jones Brian,Obmolova Galina,Malia Thomas J,Baker Audrey,Bethea Deidra,Elloso M Merle,Naso Michael,Taudte Susann	Cytokine. 53(1) 107-14	interleukin-17A	GITIPRNPGCPNSEDKNFPRTVMVNLNIHNRNTNTNPKRSSDYYNRSTSPWNLHRNEDPERYPSVIWEAQCRHLGCINADGNVDYHMNSVPIQQEILVLRREPPHCPNSFRLEKILVSVGCTCVTPIVHHVQ	without signal peptide, K93Q/A155Q mutant	Q16552	Cytokine		9.0	5	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	t	f
20676803	Production of hepatopoietin Cn in high-cell-density cultures of recombinant Escherichia coli and detection of its antioxygen activity.	Hepatopoietin Cn (HPPCn), a member of the leucine-rich acidic nuclear protein (LANP) family, is a novel human hepatic growth factor that stimulates DNA synthesis and hepatocyte proliferation in vivo and in vitro by activating several signaling pathways. We performed pilot-scale production of recombinant human HPPCn (rhHPPCn) protein to elucidate its role in liver protection. An Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain containing a pET-24a-HPPCn expression vector was cultivated in a 40-l bioreactor. High-cell-density fed-batch fermentation using this strain yielded a high concentration of rhHPPCn protein in the form of inclusion bodies. After washing and solubilization of the protein, rhHPPCn refolding was achieved by dilution of the denaturant. Then, the renatured protein was purified chromatographically. Assessment of the biological activity of the obtained protein showed that rhHPPCn could attenuate the oxidative stress in ethanol-induced hepatocyte injury. We successfully achieved large-scale production of biologically active rhHPPCn protein and obtained yields greater than 40 mg rhHPPCn per gram dry cell weight by applying the above-mentioned renaturation and purification procedures. The obtained volumetric yield corresponds to 640 mg of biologically active rhHPPCn per liter of culture broth. Additionally, the recombinant HPPCn protein was confirmed to protect hepatocytes against ethanol-induced oxidative stress.	2011 Jan	Liu Yang,Li Xiao-Li,Zhang Dong-Dong,Wang Qiang,Liu Yong,Liu Dong-Mei,Wu Chu-Tse,Cui Chun-Ping	Molecular biotechnology. 47(2) 111-9	Hepatopoietin Cn	MEMGRRIHLELRNRTPSDVKELVLDNSRSNEGKLEGLTDEFEELEFLSTINVGLTSIANLPKLNKLKKLELSDNRVSGGLEVLAEKCPNLTHLNLSGNKIKDLSTIEPLKKLENLKSLDLFNCEVTNLNDYRENVFKLLPQLTYLDGYDRDDKEAPDSDAEGYVEGLDDEEEDEDEEEYDEDAQVVEDEEDEDEEEEGEEEDVSGEEEEDEEGYNDGEVDDEEDEEELGEEERGQKRKREPEDEGEDDD		P39687	Repressor	full length	8.0	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
20688116	A simple approach for the preparation of mature human relaxin-3.	Relaxin-3 (also known as INSL7) is the most recently identified member of the insulin-like family. It is predominantly expressed in the nucleus incertus of the brain and involved in the control of stress response, food intake, and reproduction. In the present work, we have established a simple approach for the preparation of the mature human relaxin-3 peptide. We first designed and recombinantly expressed a single-chain relaxin-3 precursor in E. coli cells. After purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography, refolding in vitro through disulfide reshuffling, and digestion by endoproteinase Asp-N, mature human relaxin-3 was obtained in high yield and at low cost. Peptide mapping and circular dichroism spectroscopy studies suggested that the recombinant relaxin-3 adopted an insulin-like fold with the expected disulfide linkages. The recombinant mature relaxin-3 was fully active in both RXFP3 binding and activation assays. The activity of the single-chain precursor was very low, suggesting that a free C-terminus of the B-chain is necessary for receptor-binding and activation of relaxin-3. Our present work provides a highly efficient approach for the preparation of relaxin-3 as well as its analogues for functional and structural analyses.	2010 Oct	Luo Xiao,Liu Ya-Li,Layfield Sharon,Shao Xiao-Xia,Bathgate Ross A D,Wade John D,Guo Zhan-Yun	Peptides. 31(11) 2083-8	relaxin-3	EARAAPY GVRLCGREFI RAVIFTCGGS RWRRSDILAH EAMGDTFPDA DADEDSLAGE LDEAMGSSEW LALTKSPQAF YRGRPSWQGT PGVLRGSRDV LAGLSSSCCK WGCSKSEISS LC	24-142 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	Q8WXF3	Hormone		8.7	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
20690636	Recombinant expression, in vitro refolding, and biophysical characterization of the human glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor.	Activation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) upon ligand binding leads to the release of insulin from pancreatic cells. This strictly glucose-dependent process renders the receptor and its ligands useful in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. To enable a biophysical characterization in vitro, we expressed the human full-length GLP-1R in the cytosol of Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies. After purification, refolding of the SDS-solubilized receptor was achieved by the exchange of SDS against the detergent Brij78 using an artificial chaperone system. Far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopic studies revealed that the receptor adopts a characteristic alpha-helical structure in Brij78 micelles. Ligand binding of the renatured protein was quantified by fluorescence quenching and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. In the presence of Brij micelles, the refolded receptor binds the agonist exendin-4 with an apparent dissociation constant of approximately 100 nM in a reversible one-step mechanism. To demonstrate that the detected ligand binding activity is not only due to an autonomously functional N-terminal domain (nGLP-1R) but also due to additional contacts with the juxtamembrane part, we separately expressed and refolded the extracellular domain relying on identical protocols established for the full-length GLP-1R. In support of the suggested multidomain binding mode, the nGLP-1R binds exendin-4 with a lower affinity (K(app) in the micromolar range) and a different kinetic mechanism. The lower ligand affinity of the nGLP-1R results entirely from a decreased kinetic stability of the receptor-ligand complex, dissociation of which is approximately 40-fold faster in the case of the nGLP-1R compared to the full-length GLP-1R. In summary, a framework was developed to produce functional human full-length GLP-1R by recombinant expression in E. coli as a prerequisite for eventual structure determination and a rigorous biophysical characterization including protein variants.	2010 Sep	Schröder-Tittmann Kathrin,Bosse-Doenecke Eva,Reedtz-Runge Steffen,Ihling Christian,Sinz Andrea,Tittmann Kai,Rudolph Rainer	Biochemistry. 49(36) 7956-65	Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor	RPQGATVSLWETVQKWREYRRQCQRSLTEDPPPATDLFCNRTFDEYACWPDGEPGSFVNVSCPWYLPWASSVPQGHVYRFCTAEGLWLQKDNSSLPWRDLSECEESKRGERSSPEEQLLFLYIIYTVGYALSFSALVIASAILLGFRHLHCTRNYIHLNLFASFILRALSVFIKDAALKWMYSTAAQQHQWDGLLSYQDSLSCRLVFLLMQYCVAANYYWLLVEGVYLYTLLAFSVLSEQWIFRLYVSIGWGVPLLFVVPWGIVKYLYEDEGCWTRNSNMNYWLIIRLPILFAIGVNFLIFVRVICIVVSKLKANLMCKTDIKCRLAKSTLTLIPLLGTHEVIFAFVMDEHARGTLRFIKLFTELSFTSFQGLMVAILYCFVNNEVQLEFRKSWERWRLEHLHIQRDSSMKPLKCPTSSLSSGATAGSSMYTATCQASCS	N-terminal His6 tag , without signal peptide	P43220	G-protein coupled receptor, Receptor, Transducer		8.5	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f
20691191	Refolding and polymerization pathways of neuroserpin.	Neuroserpin is a member of the serpin superfamily, and its mutants are retained within the endoplasmic reticulum of neurons as ordered polymers in association with dementia. It has been proposed that neuroserpin polymers are formed by a conformational change in the folded protein. However, an alternative model whereby polymers are formed during protein folding rather than from the folded protein has recently been proposed. We investigated the refolding and polymerization pathways of wild-type neuroserpin (WT) and of the pathogenic mutants S49P and H338R. Upon refolding, denatured WT immediately formed an initial refolding intermediate I(IN) and then underwent further refolding to the native form through a late refolding intermediate, I(R). The late-onset mutant S49P was also able to refold to the native form through I(IN) and I(R), but the final refolding step proceeded at a slower rate and with a lower refolding yield as compared with WT. The early-onset mutant H338R formed I(R) through the same pathway as S49P, but the protein could not attain the native state and remained as I(R). The I(R)s of the mutants had a long lifespan at 4 °C and thus were purified and characterized. Strikingly, when incubated under physiological conditions, I(R) formed ordered polymers with essentially the same properties as the polymers formed from the native protein. The results show that the mutants have a greater tendency to form polymers during protein folding than to form polymers from the folded protein. Our finding provides insights into biochemical approaches to treating serpinopathies by targeting a polymerogenic folding intermediate.	2010 Oct	Takehara Sayaka,Zhang Juan,Yang Xiaoyan,Takahashi Nobuyuki,Mikami Bunzo,Onda Maki	Journal of molecular biology. 403(5) 751-62	Neuroserpin	TGATFPEEAIADLSVNMYNRLRATGEDENILFSPLSIALAMGMMELGAQGSTQKEIRHSMGYDSLKNGEEFSFLKEFSNMVTAKESQYVMKIANSLFVQNGFHVNEEFLQMMKKYFNAAVNHVDFSQNVAVANYINKWVENNTNNLVKDLVSPRDFDAATYLALINAVYFKGNWKSQFRPENTRTFSFTKDDESEVQIPMMYQQGEFYYGEFSDGSNEAGGIYQVLEIPYEGDEISMMLVLSRQEVPLATLEPLVKAQLVEEWANSVKKQKVEVYLPRFTVEQEIDLKDVLKALGITEIFIKDANLTGLSDNKEIFLSKAIHKSFLEVNEEGSEAAAVSGMIAISRMAVLYPQVIVDHPFFFLIRNRRTGTILFMGRVMHPETMNTSGHDFEEL	N-terminal His6 tag, without signal peptide	Q99574	Protease inhibitor, Serine protease inhibitor		7.8	0.5	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f

20691269	Expression, purification, and refolding of a recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 in vitro.	In this work, the recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2) gene was cloned from MG-63 cells by RT-PCR, and the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli expression system, purified by Ni-NTA column under denaturing conditions and refolded at 4°C by urea gradient dialysis. We found that the protein refolding yield was increased with the increase of pH value from pH 6.0 to pH 9.0. The yield was 42% and 96% at pH 7.4 and pH 9.0, respectively, while that at pH 6.0 was only 3.4%. The cell culture results showed that the rhBMP-2 refolded at pH 7.4 urea gradient dialysis had higher biological activity for MG-63 cell proliferation and differentiation than that refolded at pH 9.0 since pH 7.4 is closer to the conditions in vivo leading to the formation of dimers through the interchain disulfide bond. Moreover, the biological activity for MG-63 was promoted with the increase of rhBMP-2 concentration in the cell culture medium. This work may be important for the in vitro production and biomedical application of rhBMP-2 protein.	2010 Nov	Zhang Yanhong,Ma Yinsun,Yang Mingying,Min Sijia,Yao Juming,Zhu Liangjun	Protein expression and purification. 75(2) 155-60	bone morphogenetic protein 2	QAKHKQRKRLKSSCKRHPLYVDFSDVGWNDWIVAPPGYHAFYCHGECPFPLADHLNSTNHAIVQTLVNSVNSKIPKACCVPTELSAISMLYLDENEKVVLKNYQDMVVEGCGCR	283-396 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	P12643	Cytokine, Developmental protein, Growth factor		7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f

20826215	Prokaryotic expression, refolding, and purification of functional human vascular endothelial growth factor isoform 165: purification procedures and refolding conditions revisited.	Human vascular endothelial growth factor isoform 165 (VEGF165) is the first known member belonging to the VEGF protein family that plays a critical role in new blood vessel formation in vivo. This study presents a new protocol with optimized conditions for rapidly producing untagged recombinant and biological active human VEGF165 (rhVEGF165) using Escherichia coli cells.

20851185	On-column refolding purification of DT389-hIL13 recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli.	Protein refolding is a bottleneck in the production of therapeutic proteins from inclusion bodies. In recent years, several studies have described on-column refolding of recombinant proteins. DT389-hIL13 is a recombinant protein that targets the glioma. In our study, the recombinant protein DT389-hIL13 was expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli). The isolated inclusion bodies were refolded using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and further purified using anion exchange chromatography. Three different methods of SEC on-column refolding were studied. In vitro tests on U251 cells showed that the recombinant protein could effectively inhibit the proliferation of U251 cells, especially the protein refolded by urea and pH gradient method. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.887 nM was achieved with this new method, unlike an IC50 of 11.4 nM achieved in the non-gradient method.	2010 Oct	Sun Weimin,Dai Xinxian,Zheng Yanpeng,Wang Jianwei,Hou Lingling,Du Juan,Hu Hong-gang	Protein expression and purification. 75(1) 83-8	IL13	SPGPVPPSTALRELIEELVNITQNQKAPLCNGSMVWSINLTAGMYCAALESLINVSGCSAIEKTQRMLSGFCPHKVSAGQFSSLHVRDTKIEVAQFVKDLLLHLKKLFREGRFN	33-146 aa, Diphteria toxin- IL13 fusion protein	P35225	Cytokine		8.0	4	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

20878241	Fusion expression and immunogenicity of Bordetella pertussis PTS1-FHA protein: implications for the vaccine development.	Mutants of pertussis toxin (PT) S1 subunit and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) type I immunodominant domain from Bordetella pertussis (B. pertussis) are considered to be effective candidate antigens for acellular pertussis vaccines; however, the substantial progress is hampered in part for the lack of a suitable in vitro expression system. In this paper, the gene sequences of a S1 mutant C180-R9K/E129G (mS1) and a truncated peptide named Fs from FHA type I immunodominant domain were linked together and constructed to pET22b expression vector as a fusion gene; after inducing with IPTG, it was highly expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) as inclusion body. The fusion protein FsmS1 was purified from cell lysates and refolded successfully. The result of Western blotting indicate that it was able to react with both anti-S1 and anti-FHA McAbs; antiserum produced from New Zealand white rabbits immunized with this protein was able to recognize both native PT and FHA antigens as determined by western blotting. These data have provided a novel feasible method to produce PT S1 subunit and FHA type I immunodominant domain in large scale in vitro, which is implicated for the development of multivalent subunit vaccines candidate against B. pertussis infection.	2011 Feb	Jinyong Zhang,Xiaoli Zhang,Weijun Zhang,Ying Guo,Gang Guo,Xuhu Mao,Quanming Zou	Molecular biology reports. 38(3) 1957-63	filamentous hemagglutinin	LKNLDLG YQAKPAPTAP PMPKAPELDL RGHTLESAEG RKIFGEYKKL QGEYEKAKMA VQAVEAYGEA TRRVHDQLGQ RYGKALGGMD AETKEVDGII QEFAADLRTV YAKQADQATI DAETDKVAQR YKSQIDAVRL Q	1974-2111 aa, filamentous hemagglutinin-pertussis toxin S1 subunit fusion protein	P12255	Hemagglutinin	immunodominant domain	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

20883662	Expression, refolding, and initial structural characterization of the Y. pestis Ail outer membrane protein in lipids.	Ail is an outer membrane protein and virulence factor of Yersinia pestis, an extremely pathogenic, category A biothreat agent, responsible for precipitating massive human plague pandemics throughout history. Due to its key role in bacterial adhesion to host cells and bacterial resistance to host defense, Ail is a key target for anti-plague therapy. However, little information is available about the molecular aspects of its function and interactions with the human host, and the structure of Ail is not known. Here we describe the recombinant expression, purification, refolding, and sample preparation of Ail for solution and solid-state NMR structural studies in lipid micelles and lipid bilayers. The initial NMR and CD spectra show that Ail adopts a well-defined transmembrane β-sheet conformation in lipids.	2010 Dec	Plesniak Leigh A,Mahalakshmi Radhakrishnan,Rypien Candace,Yang Yuan,Racic Jasmina,Marassi Francesca M	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1808(1) 482-9	Ail	EGESSISIGYAQSRVKEDGYKLDKNPRGFNLKYRYEFNNDWGVIGSFAQTRRGFEESVDGFKLIDGDFKYYSVTAGPVFRINEYVSLYGLLGAGHGKAKFSSIFGQSESRSKTSLAYGAGLQFNPHPNFVIDASYEYSKLDDVKVGTWMLGAGYRF	without signal peptide (39-194 aa)	Q8D0Z7			7.0	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	t	f	f
20920547	Mutagenesis analyses explore residues responsible for the neurotoxic and anticoagulant activities of Trimucrotoxin, a pit-viper venom Asn6-phospholipase A2.	Trimucrotoxin (TmCT) is an Asn(6)-containing phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) from Protobothrops mucrosquamatus (pit-viper) venom. In an attempt to characterize the amino acid residues responsible for the neurotoxic and anticoagulant activities of TmCT, the recombinant fusion proteins of TmCT wild type and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli. Correct refolding and processing of 37 TmCT mutants were confirmed by their HPLC retention times, circular dichroism spectra, and masses obtained from ESI-MS spectrometry. Each mutant was assayed by pH-stat titration using zwitterionic as well as anionic micelle substrates, and the neurotoxicity was evaluated by using the contractile responses of chick biventer cervicis muscles. The results demonstrated that the residues Asn(1), Asn(6), Lys(7), Ile(11), Met(12), Gly(53), Thr(79), His(108) and Met(118) are important to TmCT neurotoxicity. Through various tests, we also confirmed that enzymatic activity, as opposed to binding to Factor Xa, was a necessary part of TmCT&#39;s anticoagulant effect. In addition, pulldown assays of the WT and selected mutants revealed that TmCT&#39;s in vitro binding to crotoxin acidic subunit may involve a broad surface area. We conclude that the hot spot mutations at specific positions 53, 79, 108, and 118 during the pit-viper Asn(6)-PLA(2) evolution regulate their neurotoxicities, and that many of the neurotoxic site residues and the anticoagulant mechanism of TmCT are different from those of ammodytoxin A (a true-viper venom neurotoxic PLA(2)).	2011 Jan	Tsai Inn-Ho,Wang Ying-Ming,Hseu Ming-Jhy	Biochimie. 93(2) 277-85	Trimucrotoxin	NLLQ FNKMIKIMTK KNAIPFYSSY GCYCGWGGQG KPKDATDRCC FVHDCCYGKL TDCSPKSDIY SYSWKTGIII CGEGTECEKK ICECDRAAAV CLGHNLRTYK KRYMFYPDFL CTDPSEKC	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag	Q90W39	Hydrolase, Myotoxin, Neurotoxin, Presynaptic neurotoxin, Toxin		9.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

In addition, pulldown assays of the WT and selected mutants revealed that TmCT&#39;s in vitro binding to crotoxin acidic subunit may involve a broad surface area. We conclude that the hot spot mutations at specific positions 53, 79, 108, and 118 during the pit-viper Asn(6)-PLA(2) evolution regulate their neurotoxicities, and that many of the neurotoxic site residues and the anticoagulant mechanism of TmCT are different from those of ammodytoxin A (a true-viper venom neurotoxic PLA(2)).	2011 Jan	Tsai Inn-Ho,Wang Ying-Ming,Hseu Ming-Jhy	Biochimie. 93(2) 277-85	Trimucrotoxin	NLLQ FEKMIKKMTK KNAIPFYSSY GCYCGWGGQG KPKDATDRCC FVHDCCYGKL TDCSPKSDIY SYSWKTGIII CGEGTECEKK ICECDRAAAV CLGHNLRTYK KRYMFYPDFL CTDPSEKC	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag, N22E/I27K mutant	Q90W39	Hydrolase, Myotoxin, Neurotoxin, Presynaptic neurotoxin, Toxin		9.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

Trimucrotoxin (TmCT) is an Asn(6)-containing phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) from Protobothrops mucrosquamatus (pit-viper) venom. In an attempt to characterize the amino acid residues responsible for the neurotoxic and anticoagulant activities of TmCT, the recombinant fusion proteins of TmCT wild type and mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli. Correct refolding and processing of 37 TmCT mutants were confirmed by their HPLC retention times, circular dichroism spectra, and masses obtained from ESI-MS spectrometry. Each mutant was assayed by pH-stat titration using zwitterionic as well as anionic micelle substrates, and the neurotoxicity was evaluated by using the contractile responses of chick biventer cervicis muscles.

The results demonstrated that the residues Asn(1), Asn(6), Lys(7), Ile(11), Met(12), Gly(53), Thr(79), His(108) and Met(118) are important to TmCT neurotoxicity. Through various tests, we also confirmed that enzymatic activity, as opposed to binding to Factor Xa, was a necessary part of TmCT&#39;s anticoagulant effect. In addition, pulldown assays of the WT and selected mutants revealed that TmCT&#39;s in vitro binding to crotoxin acidic subunit may involve a broad surface area. We conclude that the hot spot mutations at specific positions 53, 79, 108, and 118 during the pit-viper Asn(6)-PLA(2) evolution regulate their neurotoxicities, and that many of the neurotoxic site residues and the anticoagulant mechanism of TmCT are different from those of ammodytoxin A (a true-viper venom neurotoxic PLA(2)).	2011 Jan	Tsai Inn-Ho,Wang Ying-Ming,Hseu Ming-Jhy	Biochimie. 93(2) 277-85	Trimucrotoxin	NLLQ FNKMIKIMTK KNAIPFYSSY GCYCGWGGQG KPKDATDRCC FVHDCCYGKL TDCGPKSDIY SYSWKTGIII CGEGTECEKK ICECDRAAAV CLGHNLRTYK KRYMFYPDFL CTDPSEKC	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag, S74G mutant	Q90W39	Hydrolase, Myotoxin, Neurotoxin, Presynaptic neurotoxin, Toxin		9.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

Correct refolding and processing of 37 TmCT mutants were confirmed by their HPLC retention times, circular dichroism spectra, and masses obtained from ESI-MS spectrometry. Each mutant was assayed by pH-stat titration using zwitterionic as well as anionic micelle substrates, and the neurotoxicity was evaluated by using the contractile responses of chick biventer cervicis muscles. The results demonstrated that the residues Asn(1), Asn(6), Lys(7), Ile(11), Met(12), Gly(53), Thr(79), His(108) and Met(118) are important to TmCT neurotoxicity. Through various tests, we also confirmed that enzymatic activity, as opposed to binding to Factor Xa, was a necessary part of TmCT&#39;s anticoagulant effect. In addition, pulldown assays of the WT and selected mutants revealed that TmCT&#39;s in vitro binding to crotoxin acidic subunit may involve a broad surface area. We conclude that the hot spot mutations at specific positions 53, 79, 108, and 118 during the pit-viper Asn(6)-PLA(2) evolution regulate their neurotoxicities, and that many of the neurotoxic site residues and the anticoagulant mechanism of TmCT are different from those of ammodytoxin A (a true-viper venom neurotoxic PLA(2)).	2011 Jan	Tsai Inn-Ho,Wang Ying-Ming,Hseu Ming-Jhy	Biochimie. 93(2) 277-85	Trimucrotoxin	NLLQ FNKMIKIMTK KNAIPFYSSY GCYCGWGGQG KPKDATDRCC FVHDCCYGKL TDCSPKSDIY SYSWKTGIII CGEGTECEKK ICECDRAAAV CLGHNLRTYK KRYMFYPDFR CTDPSEKC	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag, L130R mutant	Q90W39	Hydrolase, Myotoxin, Neurotoxin, Presynaptic neurotoxin, Toxin		9.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

21046350	Expression, purification, and characterization of recombinant fibulin-5 in a prokaryote expression system.	Fibulin-5 is a widely expressed, integrin-binding extracellular matrix protein that mediates endothelial cell adhesion and scaffolds cells to elastic fibers. To investigate anti-angiogenesis activities and context-specific activities on responsive cells of recombinant fibulin-5 (rfibulin-5) expressed in Escherichia coli, the cDNA of fibulin-5 cloned from a human placenta cDNA library was inserted into the pET32a (+) vector to allow fibulin-5 expression as a Trx fusion protein. The fusion protein Trx-fibulin-5, expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies, was solubilized and its resulting expression level reached to 150f the total cell protein. The Trxfibulin-5 was purified effectively by N(2+)-chelating chromatography and then identified by Western blotting analysis with an anti-His tag antibody. The purified Trx-fibulin-5 was refolded by dialysis against redox reagents, and the rfibulin-5 released from the fusion protein by enterokinase cleavage was purified using a RESOURCE RPC column. The final purified rfibulin-5 effectively inhibited angiogenesis in chicken embryos in a dose-dependent manner through a chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Additionally, rfibulin-5 potently suppressed in vitro proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, but stimulated that of human dermal fibroblasts. The expression and in vitro refolding of rfibulin-5 resulted in production of an active molecule with a yield of 2.1 mg/L.	2010 Nov	Jeong Myoung Seok,Kang Chang Soo,Han Yeon Soo,Bang In Seok	Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea). 48(5) 695-700	Fibulin-5	QAQCTNGFDLDRQSGQCLDIDECRTIPEACRGDMMCVNQNGGYLCIPRTNPVYRGPYSNPYSTPYSGPYPAAAPPLSAPNYPTISRPLICRFGYQMDESNQCVDVDECATDSHQCNPTQICINTEGGYTCSCTDGYWLLEGQCLDIDECRYGYCQQLCANVPGSYSCTCNPGFTLNEDGRSCQDVNECATENPCVQTCVNTYGSFICRCDPGYELEEDGVHCSDMDECSFSEFLCQHECVNQPGTYFCSCPPGYILLDDNRSCQDINECEHRNHTCNLQQTCYNLQGGFKCIDPIRCEEPYLRISDNRCMCPAENPGCRDQPFTILYRDMDVVSGRSVPADIFQMQATTRYPGAYYIFQIKSGNEGREFYMRQTGPISATLVMTRPIKGPREIQLDLEMITVNTVINFRGSSVIRLRIYVSQYPF	without signal peptide, N-terminal Trx and His6 tag	Q9UBX5	Cell adhesion		7.4		f	t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21070667	Expression in E. coli and characterization of the catalytic domain of Botrytis cinerea chitin synthase.	BACKGROUND:Chitin synthase 3a (CHS3a) from Botrytis cinerea (Bc) catalyses the multiple transfer of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues to the growing chitin chain. Chitin, a β-1,4 linked GlcNAc homopolymer, is an essential cell wall component of filamentous fungi. Chitin synthase, processive membranous protein, has been recognized as a promising target for new antifungicides. Enzymatic characterizations of chitin synthases have been limited, mainly because purity and amounts of integral enzyme obtained after purification procedures have not been sufficient.FINDINGS:We undertook the preparation of two BcCHS3a fragment proteins, containing only the central domain and devoid of the N-terminal and transmembrane C-terminal regions. The central domain of CHS3a, named SGC (Spsa GntI Core), is conserved in all UDP-glycosyltransferases and it is believed to contain the active site of the enzyme. CHS3a-SGC protein was totally expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. We performed recombinant CHS3a-SGC purification in denaturing conditions, followed by a refolding step. Although circular dichroism spectra clearly exhibited secondary structures of renatured CHS3a-SGC, no chitin synthase activity was detected. Nevertheless CHS3a-SGC proteins show specific binding for the substrate UDP-GlcNAc with a dissociation constant similar to the Michaelis constant and a major contribution of the uracil moiety for recognition was confirmed.CONCLUSIONS:Milligram-scale quantities of CHS3a-SGC protein with native-like properties such as specific substrate UDP-GlcNAc binding could be easily obtained. These results are encouraging for subsequent heterologous expression of full-length CHS3a.	2010 Dec	Magellan Hervé,Drujon Thierry,Thellend Annie,Piffeteau Annie,Becker Hubert F	BMC research notes. 3 299	Chitin synthase 3a	RK VKLVQGSVLS VDHPVPSAIK NAIQQKYRND LEGGSEEFTH MRYTAATCDP DEFTLKNGYN LRPAMYNRHT ELLIAVTYYN EDKQLTARTL HGVMQNIRDI VNLKKSDFWN VGGPAWQKIV VCLVFDGIDP CDKDTLDVLA TIGIYQDGVM KKDVDGKETV AHVFEYTTQL SVTASQQLIR PTEGDANCLP PVQMMFCLKA KNTKKINSHR WLFNAFGRLL NPEVCILLDA GTKPGPKSLL SLWEGFYNDK DLGGACGEIH AMLGKGGKKL LNPLVAGQNF EYKISNILDK PLESSFGYVS VLPGAFSAYR FRAIMGRPLE QYFHGDHTLS KILGKKGIEG MNIFKKNMFL AEDRILCFEL VAKAGSKWHL TYIKAAKGET DVPEGAAEFI GQRRRWLNGS FAAGMYSIMH FGRMYKSGHN	N-terminal His6 tag, 138-560 aa	Q8TG14	Glycosyltransferase, Transferase	central domain	6.5		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f

21074529	Functional analysis of propeptide as an intramolecular chaperone for in vivo folding of subtilisin nattokinase.	Here, we show that during in vivo folding of the precursor, the propeptide of subtilisin nattokinase functions as an intramolecular chaperone (IMC) that organises the in vivo folding of the subtilisin domain. Two residues belonging to β-strands formed by conserved regions of the IMC are crucial for the folding of the subtilisin domain through direct interactions. An identical protease can fold into different conformations in vivo due to the action of a mutated IMC, resulting in different kinetic parameters. Some interfacial changes involving conserved regions, even those induced by the subtilisin domain, blocked subtilisin folding and altered its conformation.

21084283	Surface supercharged human enteropeptidase light chain shows improved solubility and refolding yield.	Enteropeptidase is a serine protease used in different biotechnological applications. For many applications the smaller light chain can be used to avoid the expression of the rather large holoenzyme. Recombinant human enteropeptidase light chain (hEPL) shows high activity but low solubility and refolding yields, currently limiting its use in biotechnological applications. Here we describe several protein modifications that lead to improved solubility and refolding yield of human hEPL whilst retaining the enzyme activity. Specifically, protein surface supercharging (N6D, G21D, G22D, N141D, K209E) of the protein increased the solubility more than 100-fold. Replacement of a free cysteine residue with serine (C112S) improved the refolding yield by 50%. The heat stability of this C112S variant was also significantly improved by supercharging. This study shows that even mild protein surface supercharging can have pronounced effects on protein solubility and stability.	2011 Feb	Simeonov Peter,Berger-Hoffmann Renate,Hoffmann Ralf,Sträter Norbert,Zuchner Thole	Protein engineering, design &amp; selection : PEDS. 24(3) 261-8	enteropeptidase	KIVGGSN AKEGAWPWVV GLYYGGRLLC GASLVSSDWL VSAAHCVYGR NLEPSKWTAI LGLHMKSNLT SPQTVPRLID EIVINPHYNR RRKDNDIAMM HLEFKVNYTD YIQPICLPEE NQVFPPGRNC SIAGWGTVVY QGTTANILQE ADVPLLSNER CQQQMPEYNI TENMICAGYE EGGIDSCQGD SGGPLMCQEN NRWFLAGVTS FGYKCALPNR PGVYARVSRF TEWIQSFLH	784-1019、N-terminal Trx and His6 tag	P98073	Hydrolase, Protease, Serine protease	light chain	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

This study shows that even mild protein surface supercharging can have pronounced effects on protein solubility and stability.	2011 Feb	Simeonov Peter,Berger-Hoffmann Renate,Hoffmann Ralf,Sträter Norbert,Zuchner Thole	Protein engineering, design &amp; selection : PEDS. 24(3) 261-8	enteropeptidase	KIVGGSN AKEGAWPWVV GLYYGGRLLC GASLVSSDWL VSAAHCVYGR NLEPSKWTAI LGLHMKSNLT SPQTVPRLID EIVINPHYNR RRKDNDIAMM HLEFKVNYTD YIQPICLPEE NQVFPPGRNC SIAGWGTVVY QGTTANILQE ADVPLLSNER CQQQMPEYNI TENMICAGYE EGGIDSCQGD SGGPLMCQEN NRWFLAGVTS FGYECALPNR PGVYARVSRF TEWIQSFLH	784-1019、N-terminal Trx and His6 tag, K994E mutant	P98073	Hydrolase, Protease, Serine protease	light chain	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21084473	Bacterial HA1 vaccine against pandemic H5N1 influenza virus: evidence of oligomerization, hemagglutination, and cross-protective immunity in ferrets.	The impending influenza virus pandemic requires global vaccination to prevent large-scale mortality and morbidity, but traditional influenza virus vaccine production is too slow for rapid responses. We have developed bacterial systems for expression and purification of properly folded functional hemagglutinin as a rapid response to emerging pandemic strains. A recombinant H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) hemagglutinin globular domain (HA1) was produced in Escherichia coli under controlled redox refolding conditions. Importantly, the properly folded HA1(1-320), i.e., HA1 lacking amino acids 321 to 330, contained ≥75 0.000000unctional oligomers without addition of foreign oligomerization sequence. Site-directed mutagenesis mapped the oligomerization signal to the HA1 N-terminal Ile-Cys-Ile residues at positions 3 to 5. The purified HA1 oligomers (but not monomers) bound fetuin and agglutinated red blood cells. Upon immunization of rabbits, the oligomeric HA1(1-320) elicited potent neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous H5N1 viruses more rapidly than HA1(28-320) containing only monomers. Ferrets vaccinated with oligomeric HA1 (but not monomeric HA1 with the N terminus deleted) at 15 and 3 μg/dose were fully protected from lethality and weight loss after challenge with homologous H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004, clade 1) virus, as well as heterologous clade 2.2 H5N1 (A/WooperSwan/Mongolia/244/2005) virus. Protection was associated with a significant reduction in viral loads in the nasal washes of homologous and heterologous virus challenged ferrets. This is the first study that describes the presence of an N-terminal oligomerization sequence in the globular domain of influenza virus hemagglutinin. Our findings suggest that functional oligomeric rHA1-based vaccines can be produced efficiently in bacterial systems and can be easily upscaled in response to a pandemic influenza virus threat.	2011 Jan	Khurana Surender,Verma Swati,Verma Nitin,Crevar Corey J,Carter Donald M,Manischewitz Jody,King Lisa R,Ross Ted M,Golding Hana	Journal of virology. 85(3) 1246-56	hemagglutinin	DQIC IGYHANNSTE QVDTIMEKNV TVTHAQDILE KKHNGKLCDL DGVKPLILRD CSVAGWLLGN PMCDEFINVP EWSYIVEKAN PVNDLCYPGD FNDYEELKHL LSRINHFEKI QIIPKSSWSS HEASLGVSSA CPYQGKSSFF RNVVWLIKKN STYPTIKRSY NNTNQEDLLV LWGIHHPNDA AEQTKLYQNP TTYISVGTST LNQRLVPRIA TRSKVNGQSG RMEFFWTILK PNDAINFESN GNFIAPEYAY KIVKKGDSTI MKSELEYGNC NTKCQTPMGA INSSMPFHNI HPLTIGECPK YVKSNRLVLA TGLRNSPQRE RRRKKR	C-terminal His6 tag, 17-346 aa	D1LP57	Hemagglutinin	globular domain			t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
21104001	Characterization of a novel immobilized biocatalyst obtained by matrix-assisted refolding of recombinant polyhydroxyoctanoate depolymerase from Pseudomonas putida KT2442 isolated from inclusion bodies.	Purification and matrix-assisted refolding of recombinant His-tagged polyhydroxyalkanoate (PhaZ) depolymerase from Pseudomonas putida KT2442 was carried out. His-tagged enzyme was overproduced as inclusion bodies in recombinant E. coli M15 (pREP4, pPAZ3), which were denatured by 8 M urea, immobilized on Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetate-agarose matrix, and refolded by gradual removal of the chaotropic agent. The refolded enzyme could not be eluted with 1 M imidazole buffer, leading to an immobilized biocatalyst where PhaZ depolymerase was homogeneously distributed in the agarose support as shown by confocal scanning microscopy. Polyhydroxyoctanoate could not be hydrolyzed by this novel immobilized biocatalyst, whereas the attached enzyme was active in the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl alkanoate esters, which differed in their alkyl chain length. Taking advantage of the observed esterase activity on p-nitrophenylacetate, functional characterization of immobilized PhaZ depolymerase was carried out. The immobilized enzyme was more stable than its soluble counterpart and showed optimal hydrolytic activity at 37°C and 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0. Kinetic parameters were obtained with both p-nitrophenylacetate and p-nitrophenyloctanoate, which had not been described so far for the soluble enzyme, representing an attractive and alternative chromogenic assay for the study of this paradigmatic enzyme.	2011 Aug	Arroyo M,García-Hidalgo J,Villalón M,de Eugenio L,Hormigo D,Acebal C,García J L,Prieto M A,de la Mata Isabel	Journal of industrial microbiology &amp; biotechnology. 38(9) 1203-9	polyhydroxyoctanoate depolymerase	MPQPYIFRTVELDNQSIRTAVRPGKPHLTPLLIFNGIGANLELVFPFIDALDPDLEVIAFDVPGVGGSSTPRNPYRFPGLAKLTARMLDYLDYGQVNVIGVSWGGALAQQFAHDYPERCKKLVLAATAAGAVMVPGKPKVLWMMASPRRYVQPSHVIRIAPMIYGGGFRRDPDLAMHHAAKVRSGGKLGYYWQLFAGLGWTSIHWLHKIRQPTLVLAGDDDPLIPLINMRLLAWRIPNAQLHIIDDGHLFLITRAEAVAPIIMKFLQEERQRAVMHPRPASGG	N-terminal His6 tag	Q88D24	Hydrolase	full length	8		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21108131	Purification and biological characterization of bacterially expressed recombinant buffalo prolactin.	Recombinant prolactin (PRL) from water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) has been cloned and expressed in a prokaryotic expression system. The hormone was also successfully refolded into a biologically active form. Total RNA was purified from buffalo pituitaries and the buPRL cDNA was synthesized using primers designed on bovine PRL sequence. This prolactin cDNA was cloned in a pET 28a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. Most of the expressed protein was present as insoluble inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized and buPRL was purified by Ni-NTA column. The purified protein was refolded by gradually decreasing the concentration of denaturant during dialysis. Total yield of the refolded and soluble prolactin was 22 mg/L from 100 mL bacterial culture in LB medium. The recombinant prolactin was as active as native prolactin in stimulating growth of Nb2 lymphoma cells.	2010 Nov	Panchal Manoj,Muralidhar Kambadur	Preparative biochemistry &amp; biotechnology. 40(4) 276-85	prolactin	MTPVCPNGPGNCQVSLRDLFDRAVMVSHYIHDLSSEMFNEFDKRYAQGKGFITMALNSCHTSSLPTPEDKEQAQQTHHEVLMSLILGLLRSWNDPLYHLVTEVRGMKGAPDAILSRAIEIEEENKRLLEGMEMIFGQVIPGAKETEPYPVWSGLPSLQTKDEEARYSAFYNLLHCLRRDSSKIDTYLKLLNCRIIYNNNC	N-terminal His6 tag	B0FWK8	Hormone	full length	8.0		f	t	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21130880	Expression, purification, and refolding of biologically active Acinetobacter baumannii OmpA from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies.	Infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii have emerged as a significant clinical problem due to the increase in infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains. A. baumannii OmpA is a highly conserved membrane protein that has multiple roles in interacting with the host during infection, and thus represents an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial therapies. In the present study, the coding sequence of the mature form of A. baumannii OmpA was cloned into the vector pET-15b and purified under denaturing conditions from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies using nickel affinity chromatography. A Triton X-114 wash step was incorporated into the purification method in order to remove endotoxin, resulting in endotoxin levels of &lt;1.3 EU/mg of protein. A protocol was developed for refolding the purified protein by dilution into the non-ionic detergent n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside followed by dialysis to remove excess denaturant and detergent. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that refolded A. baumannii OmpA was able to induce cell death in A549 cells. In addition, a polyclonal antibody was raised against the refolded protein and used to assess extracellular secretion of OmpA by Western blot. This protein expression and purification system may be useful for further characterization of A. baumannii OmpA.	2011 Feb	McConnell Michael J,Pachón Jerónimo	Protein expression and purification. 77(1) 98-103	outer membrane protein A	GVTVTPLLLGYTFQDSQHNNGGKDGNLTNGPELQDDLFVGAALGIELTPWLGFEAEYNQVKGDVDGASAGAEYKQKQINGNFYVTSDLITKNYDSKIKPYVLLGAGHYKYDFDGVNRGTRGTSEEGTLGNAGVGAFWRLNDALSLRTEARATYNADEEFWNYTALAGLNVVLGGHLKPAAPVVEVAPVEPTPVAPQPQELTEDLNMELRVFFDTNKSNIKDQYKPEIAKVAEKLSEYPNATARIEGHTDNTGPRKLNERLSLARANSVKSALVNEYNVDASRLSTQGFAWDQPIADNKTKEGRAMNRRVFATITGSRTVVVQPGQEAAAPAAAQ	23-356 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	Q6RYW5	Porin		7.3	42	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21134129	Molecular characterization of secretory proteins Rv3619c and Rv3620c from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.	Rv3619c and Rv3620c are the secretory, antigenic proteins of the ESAT-6/CFP-10 family of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. In this article, we show that Rv3619c interacts with Rv3620c to form a 1 : 1 heterodimeric complex with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 4.8 × 10(-7) M. The thermal unfolding of the heterodimer was completely reversible, with a T(m) of 48 °C. The comparative thermodynamics and thermal unfolding analysis of the Rv3619c-Rv3620c dimer, the ESAT-6-CFP-10 dimer and another ESAT family heterodimer, Rv0287-Rv0288, revealed that the binding strength and stability of Rv3619c-Rv3620c are relatively lower than those of the other two pairs. Molecular modeling and docking studies predict the structure of Rv3619c-Rv3620c to be similar to that of ESAT-6-CFP-10. Spectroscopic studies revealed that, in an acidic environment, Rv3619c and Rv3620c lose their secondary structure and interact weakly to form a complex with a lower helical content, indicating that Rv3619c-Rv3620c is destabilized at low pH. These results, combined with those of previous studies, suggest that unfolding of the proteins is required for dissociation of the complex and membrane binding. In the presence of membrane mimetics, the α-helical contents of Rv3619c and Rv3620 increased by 42% and 35%, respectively. In mice, the immune response against Rv3619c protein is characterized by increased levels of interferon-γ, interleukin-12 and IgG(2a) , indicating a dominant Th1 response, which is mandatory for protection against mycobacterial infection. This study therefore emphasizes the potential of Rv3619c as a subunit vaccine candidate.	2011 Jan	Mahmood Anjum,Srivastava Shubhra,Tripathi Sarita,Ansari Mairaj Ahmed,Owais Mohammad,Arora Ashish	The FEBS journal. 278(2) 341-53	Rv3619c	MTINYQFGDVDAHGAMIRAQAGSLEAEHQAIISDVLTASDFWGGAGSAACQGFITQLGRNFQVIYEQANAHGQKVQAAGNNMAQTDSAVGSSWA	N-terminal His6 tag	P9WNK1		full length	6.5		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f

21149297	Chemical visualization of an attractant peptide, LURE.	The pollen tube attractant peptide LUREs of Torenia fournieri are diffusible peptides that attract pollen tubes in vitro. Here, we report a method enabling the direct visualization of a LURE peptide without inhibiting its attraction activity by conjugating it with the Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescent dye. After purifying and refolding the recombinant LURE2 with a polyhistidine tag, its amino groups were targeted for conjugation with the Alexa Fluor dye. Labeling of LURE2 was confirmed by its fluorescence and mass spectrometry. In our in vitro assay using gelatin beads, Alexa Fluor 488-labeled LURE2 appeared to have the same activity as unlabeled LURE2. Using the labeled LURE2, the relationship between the spatiotemporal change of distribution and activity of LURE2 was examined. LURE2 attracted pollen tubes when embedded in gelatin beads, but hardly at all when in agarose beads. Direct visualization suggested that the significant difference between these conditions was the retention of LURE2 in the gelatin bead, which might delay diffusion of LURE2 from the bead. Direct visualization of LURE peptide may open the way to studying the spatiotemporal dynamics of LURE in pollen tube attraction.	2011 Jan	Goto Hiroaki,Okuda Satohiro,Mizukami Akane,Mori Hitoshi,Sasaki Narie,Kurihara Daisuke,Higashiyama Tetsuya	Plant &amp; cell physiology. 52(1) 49-58	LURE2	SWIPFSKPKRGSYRLESDQERCAYLFPEDEAYAIESCNTRCKRTHGETAFGYCDFTFPYWTAGECQCWSK	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag	B9ZZY3			8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
21168506	FhuA deletion variant Δ1-159 overexpression in inclusion bodies and refolding with Polyethylene-Poly(ethylene glycol) diblock copolymer.	Membrane protein isolation is a challenging problem. In fact especially their extraction from the respective membrane is difficult and often goes along with losses in yield. Usually expensive detergents are needed to extract the target protein from the membrane. Therefore finding an efficient overexpression and extraction method and an alternative to detergents is desirable. In this study we describe a new and fast method to express, extract and purify an engineered variant of the FhuA protein (FhuA Δ1-159) that acts as passive diffusion channel, using a diblock copolymer as an alternative to detergents like octyl-POE (n-octylpolyoxyethylene). The N-terminal leader sequence, facilitating the protein&#39;s transport to the outer membrane was deleted (FhuA Δ1-159 Δsignal), resulting in protein accumulation in easy to isolate inclusion bodies. Urea was used to solubilise the unfolded protein and dialysis against phosphate-buffer containing the commercially available diblock copolymer PE-PEG[Polyethylene-Poly(ethyleneglycol)] lead to protein refolding. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a high β-sheet percentage within the refolded protein secondary structure indicating the successful reconstitution of FhuA Δ1-159 Δsignal native state. Furthermore the channel functionality of FhuA Δ1-159 Δsignal was verified by measuring the in and out-flux through the protein when inserted into liposome membrane, using the HRP/TMB (HRP=Horse Radish Peroxidase, TMB=3,3&#39;,5,5&#39;-tetramethylbenzidine) assay system.	2011 Feb	Dworeck Tamara,Petri Anne-Kathrin,Muhammad Noor,Fioroni Marco,Schwaneberg Ulrich	Protein expression and purification. 77(1) 75-9	FhuA	LKEVQFKAGTDSLFQTGFDFSDSLDDDGVYSYRLTGLARSANAQQKGSEEQRYAIAPAFTWRPDDKTNFTFLSYFQNEPETGYYGWLPKEGTVEPLPNGKRLPTDFNEGAKNNTYSRNEKMVGYSFDHEFNDTFTVRQNLRFAENKTSQNSVYGYGVCSDPANAYSKQCAALAPADKGHYLARKYVVDDEKLQNFSVDTQLQSKFATGDIDHTLLTGVDFMRMRNDINAWFGYDDSVPLLNLYNPVNTDFDFNAKDPANSGPYRILNKQKQTGVYVQDQAQWDKVLVTLGGRYDWADQESLNRVAGTTDKRDDKQFTWRGGVNYLFDNGVTPYFSYSESFEPSSQVGKDGNIFAPSKGKQYEVGVKYVPEDRPIVVTGAVYNLTKTNNLMADPEGSFFSVEGGEIRARGVEIEAKAALSASVNVVGSYTYTDAEYTTDTTYKGNTPAQVPKHMASLWADYTFFDGPLSGLTLGTGGRYTGSSYGDPANSFKVGSYTVVDALVRYDLARVGMAGSNVALHVNNLFDREYVASCFNTYGCFWGAERQVVATATFRF	194-747 aa	P06971	Receptor		8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
21181456	Refolding by high pressure of a toxin containing seven disulfide bonds: bothropstoxin-1 from Bothrops jararacussu.	Aggregation is a serious obstacle for recovery of biologically active heterologous proteins from inclusion bodies (IBs) produced by recombinant bacteria. E. coli transformed with a vector containing the cDNA for Bothropstoxin-1 (BthTx-1) expressed the recombinant product as IBs. In order to obtain the native toxin, insoluble and aggregated protein was refolded using high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). IBs were dissolved and refolded (2 kbar, 16 h), and the effects of protein concentration, as well as changes in ratio and concentration of oxido-shuffling reagents, guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), and pH in the refolding buffer, were assayed. A 32% yield (7.6 mg per liter of bacterial culture) in refolding of the native BthTx-1 was obtained using optimal conditions of the refolding buffer (Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 3 mM of a 2:3 ratio of GSH/GSSG, and 1 M GdnHCl). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that that disaggregation of part of IBs particles occurred upon compression and that the morphology of the remaining IBs, spherical particles, was not substantially altered. Dose-dependent cytotoxic activity of high-pressure refolded BthTx-1 was shown in C2C12 muscle cells.	2011 Jun	Balduino Keli N,Spencer Patrick J,Malavasi Natalia V,Chura-Chambi Rosa M,Lemke Laura S,Morganti Ligia	Molecular biotechnology. 48(3) 228-34	Bothropstoxin-1	SLFELGKMILQETGKNPAKSYGAYGCNCGVLGRGKPKDATDRCCYVHKCCYKKLTGCDPKKDRYSYSWKDKTIVCGENNPCLKELCECDKAVAICLRENLGTYNKKYRYHLKPFCKKADPC	without signal peptide	Q90249	Antibiotic, Antimicrobial, Myotoxin, Toxin		7.5		f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21186781	The amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment C100 occurs in monomeric and dimeric stable conformations and binds γ-secretase modulators.	The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide is contained within the C-terminal fragment (β-CTF) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is intimately linked to Alzheimer&#39;s disease. In vivo, Aβ is generated by sequential cleavage of β-CTF within the γ-secretase module. To investigate γ-secretase function, in vitro assays are in widespread use which require a recombinant β-CTF substrate expressed in bacteria and purified from inclusion bodies, termed C100. So far, little is known about the conformation of C100 under different conditions of purification and refolding. Since C100 dimerization influences the efficiency and specificity of γ-secretase cleavage, it is also of great interest to determine the secondary structure and the oligomeric state of the synthetic substrate as well as the binding properties of small molecules named γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) which we could previously show to modulate APP transmembrane sequence interactions [Richter et al. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 14597-14602]. Here, we use circular dichroism and continuous-wave electron spin resonance measurements to show that C100 purified in a buffer containing SDS at micelle-forming concentrations adopts a highly stable α-helical conformation, in which it shows little tendency to aggregate or to form higher oligomers than dimers. By surface plasmon resonance analysis and molecular modeling we show that the GSM sulindac sulfide binds to C100 and has a preference for C100 dimers.	2011 Feb	Botev Anne,Munter Lisa-Marie,Wenzel Ringo,Richter Luise,Althoff Veit,Ismer Jochen,Gerling Ulla,Weise Christoph,Koksch Beate,Hildebrand Peter W,Bittl Robert,Multhaup Gerd	Biochemistry. 50(5) 828-35	Amyloid Precursor Protein	MDAEFRHDSG YEVHHQKLVF FAEDVGSNKG AIIGLMVGGV VIATVIVITL VMLKKKQYTS IHHGVVEVDA AVTPEERHLS KMQQNGYENP TYKFFEQMQN	C-terminal His6 tag, 671-770 aa	P05067	Protease inhibitor, Serine protease inhibitor	C-terminal fragment	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

(2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 14597-14602]. Here, we use circular dichroism and continuous-wave electron spin resonance measurements to show that C100 purified in a buffer containing SDS at micelle-forming concentrations adopts a highly stable α-helical conformation, in which it shows little tendency to aggregate or to form higher oligomers than dimers. By surface plasmon resonance analysis and molecular modeling we show that the GSM sulindac sulfide binds to C100 and has a preference for C100 dimers.	2011 Feb	Botev Anne,Munter Lisa-Marie,Wenzel Ringo,Richter Luise,Althoff Veit,Ismer Jochen,Gerling Ulla,Weise Christoph,Koksch Beate,Hildebrand Peter W,Bittl Robert,Multhaup Gerd	Biochemistry. 50(5) 828-35	Amyloid Precursor Protein	MDAEFRHDSG YEVHHQKLVF FAEDVGSNKG AIIILMVGGV VIATVIVITL VMLKKKQYTS IHHGVVEVDA AVTPEERHLS KMQQNGYENP TYKFFEQMQN	C-terminal His6 tag, 671-770 aa, G704I mutant	P05067	Protease inhibitor, Serine protease inhibitor	C-terminal fragment	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

21190048	Identification of the copper-binding ligands of lysyl oxidase.	In order to identify the ligands coordinating with copper in lysyl oxidase, the enzyme was expressed in an E. coli expression system and active enzyme obtained after refolding in the presence of Cu(II). The five histidines found in the putative copper-binding region were sequentially mutated to alanines and the enzymatic activities of the resultant mutants were monitored, together with the copper content, the CD and fluorescence spectra, and the redox-cycling activity. The spectroscopic results show that in all cases the protein folded correctly but that the copper-content, enzymatic activity, and redox-cycling ability depended on the mutation. One mutant was fully functional, and two others completely lacked copper, the lysyl tyrosyl quinone (LTQ) cofactor, and activity. A fourth incorporated copper but lacked LTQ and enzymatic activity. The remaining mutant incorporated copper and had redox-cycling activity but no enzymatic activity. The results suggest that three of the five histidines in the putative copper-binding domain, H292, H294, H296, are the copper ligands and essential to the formation of LTQ. A fourth, H289, is not involved in LTQ formation or activity, while a fifth, H303, is suggested to be a general base in the catalytic mechanism.	2011 Jun	Lopez Karlo M,Greenaway Frederick T	Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996). 118(7) 1101-9	lysyl oxidase	DDPYNPYKYSDDNPYYNYYDTYERPRPGGRYRPGYGTGYFQYGLPDLVADPYYIQASTYVQKMSMYNLRCAAEENCLASTAYRADVRDYDHRVLLRFPQRVKNQGTSDFLPSRPRYSWEWHSCHQHYHSMDEFSHYDLLDANTQRRVAEGHKASFCLEDTSCDYGYHRRFACTAHTQGLSPGCYDTYGADIDCQWIDITDVKPGNYILKVSVNPSYLVPESDYTNNVVRCDIRYTGHHAYASGCTISPY	C-terminal His6 tag, 169-417 aa	P28300	Oxidoreductase		9.6	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

21210990	Heterologous expression, purification and characterization of nitrilase from Aspergillus niger K10.	BACKGROUND:Nitrilases attract increasing attention due to their utility in the mild hydrolysis of nitriles. According to activity and gene screening, filamentous fungi are a rich source of nitrilases distinct in evolution from their widely examined bacterial counterparts. However, fungal nitrilases have been less explored than the bacterial ones. Nitrilases are typically heterogeneous in their quaternary structures, forming short spirals and extended filaments, these features making their structural studies difficult.RESULTS:A nitrilase gene was amplified by PCR from the cDNA library of Aspergillus niger K10. The PCR product was ligated into expression vectors pET-30(+) and pRSET B to construct plasmids pOK101 and pOK102, respectively. The recombinant nitrilase (Nit-ANigRec) expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-Gold(DE3)(pOK101/pTf16) was purified with an about 2-fold increase in specific activity and 35% yield. The apparent subunit size was 42.7 kDa, which is approx. 4 kDa higher than that of the enzyme isolated from the native organism (Nit-ANigWT), indicating post-translational cleavage in the enzyme&#39;s native environment. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that a C-terminal peptide (Val327 - Asn₃₅₆) was present in Nit-ANigRec but missing in Nit-ANigWT and Asp₂₉₈-Val₃₁₃ peptide was shortened to Asp₂₉₈-Arg₃₁₀ in Nit-ANigWT. The latter enzyme was thus truncated by 46 amino acids. Enzymes Nit-ANigRec and Nit-ANigWT differed in substrate specificity, acid/amide ratio, reaction optima and stability. Refolded recombinant enzyme stored for one month at 4°C was fractionated by gel filtration, and fractions were examined by electron microscopy. The late fractions were further analyzed by analytical centrifugation and dynamic light scattering, and shown to consist of a rather homogeneous protein species composed of 12-16 subunits. This hypothesis was consistent with electron microscopy and our modelling of the multimeric nitrilase, which supports an arrangement of dimers into helical segments as a plausible structural solution.CONCLUSIONS:The nitrilase from Aspergillus niger K10 is highly homologous (≥86%) with proteins deduced from gene sequencing in Aspergillus and Penicillium genera. As the first of these proteins, it was shown to exhibit nitrilase activity towards organic nitriles. The comparison of the Nit-ANigRec and Nit-ANigWT suggested that the catalytic properties of nitrilases may be changed due to missing posttranslational cleavage of the former enzyme. Nit-ANigRec exhibits a lower tendency to form filaments and, moreover, the sample homogeneity can be further improved by in vitro protein refolding. The homogeneous protein species consisting of short spirals is expected to be more suitable for structural studies.	2011 Jan	Kaplan Ondřej,Bezouška Karel,Plíhal Ondřej,Ettrich Rüdiger,Kulik Natallia,Vaněk Ondřej,Kavan Daniel,Benada Oldřich,Malandra Anna,Sveda Ondřej,Veselá Alicja B,Rinágelová Anna,Slámová Kristýna,Cantarella Maria,Felsberg Jürgen,Dušková Jarmila,Dohnálek Jan,Kotik Michael,Křen Vladimír,Martínková Ludmila	BMC biotechnology. 11 2	nitrilase	MAPVLKKYKAAAVNAEPGWFNLEESVRRTIHWIDEAGKAGCKFIAFPELWIPGYPYWMWKVNYQESLPLLKKYRENSLPSDSDEMRRIRNAARANKIYVSLGYSEVDLASLYTTQVMISPSGDILNHRRKIRATHVERLVFGDGTGDTTESVIQTDIGRVGHLNCWENMNPFMKAYAASLGEQVHVAAWPLYPGKETLKYPDPFTNVAEANADLVTPAYAIETGTYTLAPWQTITAEGIKLNTPPGKDLEDPHIYNGHGRIFGPDGQNLVPHPDKDFEGLLFVDIDLDECHLSKSLADFGGHYMRPDLIRLLVDTNRKDLVVREDRVNGGVEYTRTVDRVGLSTPLDIANTVDSEN		A9QXE0	Lyase	full length	7.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
21212947	A rational design for hepatitis B virus X protein refolding and bioprocess development guided by second virial coefficient studies.	The hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein is well known for its role in hepatitis B virus infection that often leads to hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite the clinical importance of HBx, there is little progress in anti-HBx drug development strategies due to shortage of HBx from native sources. Consistent expression of HBx as insoluble inclusion bodies within various expression systems has largely hindered HBx manufacturing via economical biosynthesis routes. Confronted by this roadblock, this study aims to quantitatively understand HBx protein behaviour in solution that will guide the rational development of a refolding-based bioprocess for HBx production. Second virial coefficient (SVC) measurements were employed to study the effects of varying physicochemical parameters on HBx intermolecular protein interaction. The SVC results suggest that covalent HBx aggregates play a key role in protein destabilisation during refolding. The use of an SVC-optimised refolding environment yielded bioactive and soluble HBx proteins from the denatured-reduced inclusion body state. This study provides new knowledge on HBx solubility behaviour in vitro, which is important in structure-function elucidation behaviour of this hydrophobic protein. Importantly, a rational refolding-based Escherichia coli bioprocess that can deliver purified and soluble HBx at large scale is successfully developed, which opens the way for rapid preparation of soluble HBx for further clinical and characterisation studies.	2011 Mar	Basu Anindya,Chen Wei Ning,Leong Susanna Su Jan	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 90(1) 181-91	hepatitis B virus X	MAARLYCQLDSSRDVLCLRPVGAESRGRPFSGPLGTLSSPSPSAVSSDHGAHLSLRGLPVCAFSSAGPCALRFTSARCMATTVNAHQILPKVLHKRTLGLPAMSTTDLEAYFKDCLFKDWEELGEEIRLKVFVLGGCRHKLVCAPSSCNFFTSA	C-terminal His6 tag	Q4R1S9	Activator	full length	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

We employed a solid-phase ELISA based on a product (rMOG(ED)(His)(6)) expressed in E. coli after subcloning the cDNA of the extracellular domain of rat MOG, performing a refolding procedure on column and affinity purification. The far-UV Circular Dichroism (CD) spectra of rMOG(ED)(His)(6) showed a β-sheet, a characteristic feature of the Ig-fold. However, in MS sera and controls we failed to detected IgM or IgG antibodies.	2011 Apr	Gori Francesca,Mulinacci Barbara,Massai Lara,Avolio Carlo,Caragnano Mariantonietta,Peroni Elisa,Lori Silvia,Chelli Mario,Papini Anna Maria,Rovero Paolo,Lolli Francesco	Journal of neuroimmunology. 233(1-2) 216-20	myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein	GQFRVIGPGHPIRALVGDEAELPCRISPGKNATGMEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGKDQDAEQAPEYRGRTELLKESIGEGKVALRIQNVRFSDEGGYTCFFRDHSYQEEAAVELKVEDPFYWINPG	28-152 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	Q63345	Cell adhesion	extracellular IgV-like domain	8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

Here, we describe a generalized method, termed semi-refolding, that is particularly applicable for purification of the functional death domain superfamily. The recombinant proteins Caspase-1 CARD, AIM2 PYD, NALP3 PYD, and RIP1 DD from inclusion bodies were successfully purified using this method.	2011 Feb	Jang Tae-ho,Park Hyun Ho	Journal of biotechnology. 151(4) 335-42	RIP1	TT SLTDKHLDPI RENLGKHWKN CARKLGFTQS QIDEIDHDYE RDGLKEKVYQ MLQKWVMREG IKGATVGKLA QALHQCSRID LLSS	N-terminal His6 tag, 579-664 aa	Q13546	Kinase, Serine/threonine-protein kinase, Transferase	death domain	5.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
21245924	Comparative production analysis of three phlebovirus nucleoproteins under denaturing or non-denaturing conditions for crystallographic studies.	Nucleoproteins (NPs) encapsidate the Phlebovirus genomic (-)RNA. Upon recombinant expression, NPs tend to form heterogeneous oligomers impeding characterization of the encapsidation process through crystallographic studies. To overcome this problem, we set up a standard protocol in which production under both non-denaturing and denaturing/refolding conditions can be investigated and compared. The protocol was applied for three phlebovirus NPs, allowing an optimized production strategy for each of them. Remarkably, the Rift Valley fever virus NP was purified as a trimer under native conditions and yielded protein crystals whereas the refolded version could be purified as a dimer. Yields of trimeric Toscana virus NP were higher from denaturing than from native condition and lead to crystals. The production of Sandfly Fever Sicilian virus NP failed in both protocols. The comparative protocols described here should help in rationally choosing between denaturing or non-denaturing conditions, which would finally result in the most appropriate and relevant oligomerized protein species. The structure of the Rift Valley fever virus NP has been recently published using a refolded monomeric protein and we believe that the process we devised will contribute to shed light in the genome encapsidation process, a key stage in the viral life cycle.	2011 Jan	Lantez Violaine,Dalle Karen,Charrel Rémi,Baronti Cécile,Canard Bruno,Coutard Bruno	PLoS neglected tropical diseases. 5(1) e936	Nucleoprotein	MDNYQELRVQFAAQAVDRNEIEQWVREFAYQGFDARRVIELLKQYGGADWEKDAKKMIVLALTRGNKPRRMMMKMSKEGKATVEALINKYKLKEGNPSRDELTLSRVAAALAGWTCQALVVLSEWLPVTGTTMDGLSPAYPRHMMHPSFAGMVDPSLPGDYLRAILDAHSLYLLQFSRVINPNLRGRTKEEVAATFTQPMNAAVNSNFISHEKRREFLKAFGLVDSNGKPSAAVMAAAQAYKTAA	N-terminal His6 tag	P21700	Ribonucleoprotein	full length	4.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f

21247263	The therapeutic potential of SA-sCD40L in the orthotopic model of superficial bladder cancer.	BACKGROUND:Intravesical administration is an important treatment against superficial bladder cancer and CD40L is essential for the protective anti-tumor immunity. In situ gene therapy with CD40L was demonstrated to successfully inhibit tumor cell growth in the orthotopic mouse model of bladder cancer. In the present study, we prepared streptavidin (SA)-tagged sCD40L and developed a novel immunotherapy for superficial bladder cancer based on the strong interaction between streptavidin and biotin.MATERIAL AND METHODS:The SA-sCD40L fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and purified on the Ni-NTA column. After refolding with dialysis, the bi-function of the fusion protein was determined by flow cytometric analysis for streptaidin-mediated surface modification of MB49 bladder cancer cells and a mouse B cell CD40L-dependent proliferation assay. The mouse orthotopic model of MB49 superficial bladder cancer was used to evaluate the efficacy of SA-sCD40L immunotherapy.RESULTS:The SA-sCD40L fusion protein exhibited both full biotin-binding property and CD40L bioactivity. After intravesical instillation, the SA-sCD40L bi-functional fusion protein was durably immobilized on the biotinylated mucosal surface of bladder wall for up to four days. The SA-sCD40L treatment significantly prolonged the survival of MB49 tumor-bearing mice and cured 500f mice with MB49 superficial bladder cancer without significant adverse effects. In addition, more tumor-infiltrating CD4(+)or CD8(+) T cells were observed in SA-sCD40L-treated group.CONCLUSION:Intravesical immobilization of SA-sCD40L elicited a strong and long-lasting immunity against the MB49 bladder cancer.	2011 Sep	Zhang Zhen,Xu Xiaoling,Zhang Xiaoren,Chen Xiqian,Chen Qingge,Dong Lina,Hu Zhiming,Li Jinlong,Gao Jimin	Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden). 50(7) 1111-8	CD40L	MQRGDEDPQIAAHVVSEANSNAASVLQWAKKGYYTMKSNLVMLENGKQLTVKREGLYYVYTQVTFCSNREPSSQRPFIVGLWLKPSSGSERILLKAANTHSSSQLCEQQSVHLGGVFELQAGASVFVNVTEASQVIHRVGFSSFGLLKL	112-260 aa, Streptavidin-CD40L fusion protein with glycine/serine-rich fl exible linker	P27548	Cytokine		10.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

21284957	High-level expression of soluble form of mouse natural killer cell receptor NKR-P1C(B6) in Escherichia coli.	Mouse NKR-P1C(B6) receptor corresponding to NK1.1 alloantigen is one of the most widespread surface markers of mouse NK and NKT cells in C57BL/6 mice detected by monoclonal antibody PK136. Although functional studies revealed the ability of this receptor to activate both natural killing and production of cytokines upon antibody crosslinking, the ligand for NKR-P1C(B6) remains unknown. In order to initiate ligand identification, structural studies, and epitope mapping experiments, we developed a simple and efficient expression and purification protocol allowing to produce large amounts of pure soluble monomeric mouse NKR-P1C(B6). Our protein encompassed approximately half of the stalk region and the entire C-terminal globular ligand binding domain. The identity of protein that was devoid of N-terminal initiation methionine and had all three expected disulfides closed was confirmed using high resolution ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Protein produced into inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli was efficiently refolded into a unique three dimensional structure as confirmed by NMR using (1)H-(15)N-HSQC spectra of uniformly labeled protein. The exceptional purity of the protein should allow its crystallization and detailed structural investigations, and is a prerequisite for its use as a probe in ligand identification and antibody epitope mapping experiments.	2011 Mar	Rozbeský Daniel,Kavan Daniel,Chmelík Josef,Novák Petr,Vaněk Ondřej,Bezouška Karel	Protein expression and purification. 77(2) 178-84	NKR-P1C(B6)	SV NLECPQDWLL HRDKCFHVSQ VSNTWEEGQA DCGRKGATLL LIQDQEELRF LLDSIKEKYN SFWIGLRFTL PDMNWKWING TTFNSDVLKI TGVTENGSCA SILGDKVTPE SCASDNRWIC QKELNHETPS NDS	89-223 aa	P27814	carbohydrate binding, receptor	extracellular ligand binding domain	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f
21296159	Efficient overexpression and purification of active full-length human transcription factor Yin Yang 1 in Escherichia coli.	The Yin Yang 1 protein is a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes through DNA and protein-protein interactions. Here we present an improved method for the expression and purification of the human full-length YY1 protein from Escherichia coli. The protein was first purified using denaturing conditions, refolded using optimized conditions and then purified using a DNA-affinity column to ≥ 951fb7850urity; this process provided a high final yield and highly active protein. The protein was active in EMSA and the fluorescence anisotropy assays. The protein retained its full activity and its initial concentration for several months when stored at -80° C. Thus, we have obtained YY1 protein with levels of activity and concentration that are suitable for spectroscopic and other biochemical studies.	2011 Mar	Golebiowski Filip M,Górecki Andrzej,Bonarek Piotr,Dziedzicka-Wasylewska Marta	Protein expression and purification. 77(2) 198-206	Yin Yang 1	MASGDTLYIATDGSEMPAEIVELHEIEVETIPVETIETTVVGEEEEEDDDDEDGGGGDHGGGGGHGHAGHHHHHHHHHHHPPMIALQPLVTDDPTQVHHHQEVILVQTREEVVGGDDSDGLRAEDGFEDQILIPVPAPAGGDDDYIEQTLVTVAAAGKSGGGGSSSSGGGRVKKGGGKKSGKKSYLSGGAGAAGGGGADPGNKKWEQKQVQIKTLEGEFSVTMWSSDEKKDIDHETVVEEQIIGENSPPDYSEYMTGKKLPPGGIPGIDLSDPKQLAEFARMKPRKIKEDDAPRTIACPHKGCTKMFRDNSAMRKHLHTHGPRVHVCAECGKAFVESSKLKRHQLVHTGEKPFQCTFEGCGKRFSLDFNLRTHVRIHTGDRPYVCPFDGCNKKFAQSTNLKSHILTHAKAKNNQ	N-terminal His6 tag	P25490	Activator, Repressor	full length	8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f

21312370	Activity of maize transglutaminase overexpressed in Escherichia coli inclusion bodies: an alternative to protein refolding.	Transglutaminases (TGases) catalyze protein post-translational modification by ε-(γ-glutamyl) links and covalent polyamine conjugation. In plants, this enzyme is poorly characterized and only the maize plastidial TGase gene (tgz) has been cloned. The tgz gene (Patent WWO03102128) had been subcloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells, and the recombinant protein (TGZp) was present mainly in inclusion bodies (IB) fraction. In this work, after overexpression of TGZ15p and SDS-PAGE IB fraction analysis, bands about 65 and 56 kDa were obtained. Western blot, alkylation and MALDI-TOF/TOF analyses indicated that the 56 kDa band corresponded to a truncated sequence from the native TGZ15p (expected MW 65 kDa), by elimination of a chloroplast signal peptide fragment during expression processing. So that large-scale protein production and protein crystallization can be applied, we characterized the TGZ15p enzyme activity in the IB protein fraction, with and without refolding. Results indicate that it presented the biochemical characteristics of other described TGases, showing a certain plant-substrate preference. Solubilization of the IB fraction with Triton X-100 as nondenaturing detergent yielded active TGZ without the need for refolding, giving activity values comparable to those of the refolded protein, indicating that this is a valuable, faster way to obtain TGZ active protein.	2011 Feb	Carvajal Patricia,Gibert Jordi,Campos Nefertiti,Lopera Oriol,Barberà Eduard,Torné Jose M,Santos Mireya	Biotechnology progress. 27(1) 232-40	Transglutaminase	MAHRGHLDGLTGQAPALMRHGSFAAGSLSSRSPLQSSSTLEMLENKLAMQTTEVEKLITENQRLASSHVVLRQDIVDTEKEMQMIRTHLGEVQTETDLQIRDLLERIRLMEVDIHSGNVVNKELHQMHMEAKRLITERQMLTLEIEDVTKELQKLSASGDNKSLPELLSELDRLRKEHHNLRSQFEFEKNTNVKQVEQMRTMEMNLITMTKQAEKLRVDVANAERRAQAAAAQAAAHAAGAQVTASQPGQLKLPRFQQQQPQTHMQVHIPATPLHISREPRLGHISRVLRLGYISREPRLGHISREPRLGHISRGARMGHISRGLRLGHISREPRLGHISREPRLGHISRVLRLGHISREPRLGHISRGPSLGHISRGPRLGHISREPRMGHISREPRMGHISRVLRLEHTTMLMMLARLMHMQVTLAIQLQATRKVQCPTIPMLHLRSQQAAVQLRTPQEASMGQLVVLDILLGKFSRAVALQMQRKHLLLHHHRQHHIPPAHMTKPEEPRDKIWDVNQMDVCHAHLLSRQIW	N-terminal His6 tag	Q6KF70	Acyltransferase, Transferase	full length	6.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21334328	Plasmodium vivax: collaborative roles for plasmepsin 4 and vivapains in hemoglobin hydrolysis.	Plasmepsins, a family of aspartic proteases of Plasmodium species, are known to participate in a wide variety of cellular processes essential for parasite survival. Therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets. Although the plasmepsins of P. falciparum have been extensively characterized, the plasmepsins of P. vivax are currently not well known. To expand our understanding of the plasmepsins of P. vivax, we characterized plasmepsin 4 of P. vivax (PvPM4). The bacterially expressed recombinant PvPM4 was insoluble, but it was easily refolded into a soluble protein. The processing of PvPM4 into a mature enzyme occurred through autocatalytic activity under acidic conditions in a pepstatin A-sensitive manner, in which process a portion of prodomain was essential for correct folding. PvPM4 could hydrolyze native human hemoglobin at acidic pHs, but preferred denatured hemoglobin as a substrate. PvPM4 acted synergistically with vivapain-2 and vivapain-3, cysteine proteases of P. vivax, in the hydrolysis of hemoglobin. The vivapains also mediated processing of PvPM4 into a mature enzyme. These results collectively suggest that PvPM4 is an active hemoglobinase of P. vivax that works collaboratively with vivapains to enhance the parasite&#39;s ability to hydrolyze hemoglobin.	2011 Apr	Moon Sung-Ung,Kang Jung-Mi,Kim Tong-Soo,Kong Yoon,Sohn Woon-Mok,Na Byoung-Kuk	Experimental parasitology. 128(2) 127-32	plasmepsin 4	QNTEHLT LAFKIERPYD KVLKTISKKN LKNYIKETFN FFKSGYMKQN YLGSENDVIE LDDVANIMFY GEGEVGDNHQ KFMLIFDTGS ANLWVPSKKC NSSGCSIKNL YDSSKSKSYE KDGTKVDITY GSGTVKGFFS KDLVTLGHLS MPYKFIEVTD TDDLEPIYSS VEFDGILGLG WKDLSIGSID PIVVELKNQN KIDNALFTFY LPVHDVHAGY LTIGGIEEKF YEGNITYEKL NHDLYWQIDL DVHFGKQTME KANVIVDSGT TTITAPSEFL NKFFANLNVI KVPFLPFYVT TCDNKEMPTL EFKSANNTYT LEPEYYMNPI LEVDDTLCMI TMLPVDIDSN TFILGDPFMR KYFTVFDYDK ESVGFAIAKN	74-450 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	A5K1E7	aspartic-type endopeptidase		8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

21334328	Plasmodium vivax: collaborative roles for plasmepsin 4 and vivapains in hemoglobin hydrolysis.	Plasmepsins, a family of aspartic proteases of Plasmodium species, are known to participate in a wide variety of cellular processes essential for parasite survival. Therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets. Although the plasmepsins of P. falciparum have been extensively characterized, the plasmepsins of P. vivax are currently not well known. To expand our understanding of the plasmepsins of P. vivax, we characterized plasmepsin 4 of P. vivax (PvPM4). The bacterially expressed recombinant PvPM4 was insoluble, but it was easily refolded into a soluble protein. The processing of PvPM4 into a mature enzyme occurred through autocatalytic activity under acidic conditions in a pepstatin A-sensitive manner, in which process a portion of prodomain was essential for correct folding.

21338097	Self-assembled virus-like particles from rotavirus structural protein VP6 for targeted drug delivery.	Proteins of viral capsid may self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) that can find many biomedical applications such as platform for drug delivery. In this paper, we describe preparation of VLPs by self-assembly of VP6, a rotavirus capsid protein that was chemically conjugated with doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer drug. VP6 was first highly expressed in E. Coli, followed by purification and renaturation. DOX was then covalently attached to VP6 to form DOX-VP6 (DVP6) conjugates, which were subsequently self-assembled into VLPs under appropriate condition. Next, lactobionic acid (LA) was chemically linked to the surface of the VLPs. We demonstrated that the aforementioned nanosystem shows specific targeting to hepatoma cell line HepG2. The chemically functionalized VLPs, a kind of biological nanoparticles with excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability, can be prepared in large scale from E. Coli through our method, which may find practical applications in biomedicine.	2011 Mar	Zhao Qinghuan,Chen Weihong,Chen Yuanding,Zhang Liming,Zhang Jinping,Zhang Zhijun	Bioconjugate chemistry. 22(3) 346-52	VP6	MDVLYSLSKTLKDARDKIVEGTLYSNVSDLIQQFNQMIITMNGNEFQTGGIGNLPTRNWSFDFGLLGTTLLNLDANYVETARNTIDYFVDFVDNVCMDEMVRESQRNGIAPQSESLRKLSGIKFKRINFDNSSEYIENWNLQNRRQRTGFTFHKPNIFPYSASFTLNRSQPAHDNLMGTMWLNAGSEIQVAGFDYSCAINAPANIQQFEHIVQLRRVLTTATITLLPDAEKFSFPRVINSADGATTWYFNPVILRPNNVEVEFLLNGQIINTYQARFGTIVARNFDTIRLSFQLMRPPNMTPSVAALFPNAQPFEHHATVGLTLRIESAICESVLADASETMLANVTSVRQEYAIPVGPVFPPGMNWTDLITNYSPSREDNLQRVFTVASIRSMLVK		Q5Q1N9	structural molecule	full length	8.8	8	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f
21365180	In vitro refolding of triosephosphate isomerase from L. donovani.	The triosephosphate isomerase of Leishmania donovani (LdTIM) was expressed at high level in Escherichia coli. The TIM gene was cloned in expression vector pET-23(a) with C-terminal 6× His tag fused in frame, and expressed as a 27.6-kDa protein in E. coli as inclusion bodies. The recombinant LdTIM from E. coli lysate was solubilized in 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. In the present study, the effect of bovine serum albumin on the reactivation of TIM was investigated. Furthermore, 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid was used to detect the structural changes induced by bovine serum albumin (BSA). Here, we conclude that BSA assists in the refolding and regain of LdTIM enzyme activity by providing framework for structure formation. This study indicates that numerous protein-protein contacts are constantly occurring inside the cell that leads to the formation of native protein.	2011 Jun	Kumar Kishore,Bhargava Prachi,Roy Uma	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 164(7) 1207-14	triosephosphate isomerase	MSAKPQPIAAANWKCNGTTASIEKLVQVLNEHIISHDVQCVVAPTFVHIPLVQATLRNPKYVVSAENAIAKSGAFTGEVSMPILKDLGINWVILGHSERRTYYGETDEIVAQTVAAACEQGFMMITCIGETLQQREVNQTAKVVLSQTSAIAAKVPKEAWSQIVLAYEPVWAIGTGKVATPEQAQEVHALLRKWVSEKVGADVATKLRILYGGSVSASNAKTLYMKADINGFLVGGASLKPEFRDIIDATRK	C-terminal His6 tag	Q0ZAG6	Isomerase	full length	7.4	25	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

21421051	Production and solid-phase refolding of human glucagon-like peptide-1 using recombinant Escherichia coli.	Human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone with pharmaceutical potential in treating type 2 diabetes mellitus is known to be rapidly degraded when expressed in Escherichia coli. For the efficient production of the intact GLP-1 using a recombinant E. coli system, a fusion protein of GLP-1 was designed to be composed of the 6-lysine tag, ubiquitin and GLP-1 (K6UbGLP-1) in a row. A fed-batch fermentation of recombinant E. coli BL21(DE3)/pAPK6UbGLP-1 was carried out in a pH-stat feeding strategy and resulted in 11.3 g/L of K6UbGLP-1 as a form of inclusion body. Solid-phase refolding of K6UbGLP-1 inclusion body using a cation exchanger of the SP Sepharose FF led to a refolding yield over 90 0.000000e+00ven at 5.2 mg protein/mL resin. On-column cleavage of the refolded K6UbGLP-1 with ubiquitin-specific protease 1 gave an authentic form of GLP-1. Instrumental analyses using mass spectrometry and reverse-phase HPLC showed that the recombinant GLP-1 released from K6UbGLP-1 was identical to the standard GLP-1.	2011 Jun	Kim Sung-Gun,Shin So-Yeon,Park Yong-Cheol,Shin Chul-Soo,Seo Jin-Ho	Protein expression and purification. 78(2) 197-203	glucagon-like peptide-1	HAEGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFIAWLVKGRG	98-128 aa, N-terminal Lys6 and ubiquitin tag	P01275	Hormone		7.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21479991	Modular design, expression and characterization of novel bifunctional mutants of fibrolase with combined platelet aggregation-inhibition and fibrinolytic activity.	Fibrolase is a non-hemorrhagic zinc metalloproteinase found in southern copperhead snake (Agkistrodon contortrix contortrix) venom that acts directly on fibrin clots and does not require plasminogen or any other blood-borne intermediate for activity. Chimeras of fibrolase with RGD peptides conferring antiplatelet activity have been synthesized covalently, but we describe a simpler, cheaper and less toxic method, using site-directed mutagensis.

Chimeric genes of fibrolase were expressed in Escherichia coli to obtain the bifunctional chimeric molecule of fibrolase that can inhibit platelet aggregation.

21510924	Identification of a core domain within the proregion of bone morphogenetic proteins that interacts with the dimeric, mature domain.	Proregions of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) fulfill important biological functions as intramolecular chaperones and for extracellular targeting of the mature signal ligand. Knowledge of the structures of the proregions would contribute to a more comprehensive picture of the biological activities of the pro-forms of BMP growth factors. In this study, a protease resistant core domain of the proregions of three BMPs was identified. For a more detailed analysis, the core domain of the BMP-2 proregion was recombinantly produced. Unfolding/refolding experiments and spectroscopic analyses proved that the core domain can be obtained as a folded entity. Binding of the core domain to the mature growth factor was demonstrated by SPR. Via peptide microarray analysis, residues within the core fragment could be identified that engage in binding to the dimeric, mature domain. Our study reveals that diverse members of the BMP family share a common, independently folding core domain within the large proregions peculiar to TGF-β superfamily members that may serve as a scaffold for folding and assembly of the dimeric proprotein complexes.	2011 May	Kuhfahl Silke,Hauburger Anja,Thieme Tino,Groppe Jay,Ihling Christian,Tomic Sladjana,Schutkowski Mike,Sinz Andrea,Schwarz Elisabeth	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 408(2) 300-5	DPP proregion protein	KDKLKPDP STLVEIEKSL LSLFNMKRPP KIDRSKIIIP EPMKKLYAEI MGHELDSVNI PKPGLLTKSA NTVRSFTHKD SKIDDRFPHH HRFRLHFDVK SIPADEKLKA AELQLTRDAL SQQVVASRSS ANRTRYQVLV YDITRVGVRGQREPSYLLLD TKTVRLNSTD TVSLDVQPAV DRWLASPQRN YGLLVEVRTV RSLKPAPHHH VRLRRSADEA HERWQHKQPL LFTYTDDGRH KARSIRDVSG GEGGGKGGRN KRQPRRPTRR KNH	213-483 aa, C-terminal His5 tag	P07713		proregion domain	8.0		t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21511037	Enhanced production of human FcγRIIa receptor by high cell density cultivation of Escherichia coli.	Human Fc receptors (FcγR) are membrane glycoproteins that are expressed on all immunologically active cells and have a well-defined role in regulating innate and adaptive immune responses by binding to the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody. Among the several classes of Fc receptors, FcγRIIa is the most widely expressed, and it serves as an important reagent in antibody engineering. Here, we report on high cell density cultivations (HCDC) of Escherichia coli for preparative scale production of FcγRIIa in a 6.6L bioreactor. Briefly, a pH-stat feeding strategy was employed, and two different cell densities (OD(600) of 46 and 100) were examined for the induction of FcγRIIa gene expression. When cells were induced at a high cell density (OD(600) of 100), the cell density increased to an OD(600) of 234 within 9h after induction, and a 2-fold higher production yield was obtained compared with that of induction at low cell density (OD(600) of 46). After simple purification steps including denaturation and refolding, 87.7 mg of soluble FcγRIIa that was more than 951fb7850ure was obtained from a 20-mL culture with high recovery yield (≈54%). The biological activity of purified FcγRIIa was also confirmed by evaluating its interaction with all subclasses of IgG antibodies using an ELISA bioassay.	2011 Jul	Velmurugan Natarajan,Kim Hee Sung,Jeong Ki Jun	Protein expression and purification. 79(1) 60-5	Fc-gamma-RIIa	QAAAPPKAVLKLEPPWINVLQEDSVTLTCQGARSPESDSIQWFHNGNLIPTHTQPSYRFKANNNDSGEYTCQTGQTSLSDPVHLTVLSEWLVLQTPHLEFQEGETIMLRCHSWKDKPLVKVTFFQNGKSQKFSHLDPTFSIPQANHSHSGDYHCTGNIGYTLFSSKPVTITVQVPSMGSSSPMGII	C-terminal His6 tag, 34-219 aa	P12318	Receptor	Extracellular domain	9.6	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
21530977	A chromatography-focused bioprocess that eliminates soluble aggregation for bioactive production of a new antimicrobial peptide candidate.	Human beta defensins (hBDs) are an important class of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which provide the host with innate protection from bacteria, fungi and viruses. Human β-defensin-25 (hBD25) is a new hBD variant which has been recently discovered in the male genital tract. Since its discovery, hBD25 was hypothesized to play a key role in protection against genital tract infection, which has significantly increased mortality rates in the last decade. However, further studies to confirm the role of hBD25 are hindered by the lack of sufficient amounts of pure hBD25 for clinical studies. This study reports the first successful development of an efficient and low cost chromatography-oriented bioprocess for production of hBD25. hBD25 was expressed predominantly as soluble aggregates although the peptide was co-expressed with a Maltose Binding Protein (MBP) fusion tag in E. coli. The soluble aggregates were disrupted by denaturation-reduction of the hBD25, followed by an in vitro size exclusion chromatography refolding step which readily yielded bioactive and purified hBD25 peptides at 901fb7850urity. The refolded hBD25 showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli K12 at a minimal inhibitory concentration of 60 μg/mL.

21543878	Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of an oligomeric species of a refolded C39 peptidase-like domain of the Escherichia coli ABC transporter haemolysin B.	The ABC transporter haemolysin B (HlyB) from Escherichia coli is part of a type I secretion system that translocates a 110 kDa toxin in one step across both membranes of this Gram-negative bacterium in an ATP-dependent manner. Sequence analysis indicates that HlyB contains a C39 peptidase-like domain at its N-terminus. C39 domains are thiol-dependent peptidases that cleave their substrates after a GG motif. Interestingly, the catalytically invariant cysteine is replaced by a tyrosine in the C39-like domain of HlyB. Here, the overexpression, purification and crystallization of the isolated C39-like domain are described as a first step towards obtaining structural insights into this domain and eventually answering the question concerning the function of a degenerated C39 domain in the ABC transporter HlyB.	2011 May	Schwarz Christian K W,Tschapek Britta,Jumpertz Thorsten,Jenewein Stefan,Lecher Justin,Willbold Dieter,Panjikar Santosh,Holland I Barry,Smits Sander H J,Schmitt Lutz	Acta crystallographica.

21575723	Expression, purification and crystallization of the human UL16-binding protein ULBP1.	UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs) are markers of cellular stress which are upregulated on the surface of virus-infected and tumor cells. Recognition of ULBP1 by the activating receptor NKG2D on the surface of cytotoxic natural killer (NK) and T cells promotes lysis of cells expressing ULBP1 and is an important mechanism of immune surveillance. We report a robust method for the generation of large quantities of crystal-grade recombinant ULBP1 protein. The extracellular portion of human ULBP1 was cloned into a T7 expression vector for expression in Escherichia coli. Unpaired cysteines in the sequence which are predicted not to be involved in the intramolecular disulfide bond formation were mutated to serine. ULBP1 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells as inclusion bodies. Purified inclusion bodies were solubilized by denaturation in guanidine, and refolded by slow dilution. The refolded protein was purified by size exclusion gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography. Furthermore, we have identified conditions optimal for the crystallization of this protein and have obtained initial diffraction data to 4.6Å from these crystals.	2011 Jul	Watson Aleksandra A,Christou Charita M,O&#39;Callaghan Christopher A	Protein expression and purification. 79(1) 44-8	UL16-binding protein 1	S GWSRAGWVDT HSLSYDFIIT PKSRPEPQWC EVQGLVDERP FLHYDCVNHK AKAFASLGKK VNVTKTWEEQ TETLRDVVDF LKGQLLDIQV ENLIPIEPLT LQARMSCEHE AHGHGRGSWQ FLFNGQKFLL FDSNNRKWTA LHPGAKKMTE KWEKNRDVTM FFQKISLGDC KMWLEEFLMY WEQMLDPTKP PSLAPGTTQP	20-220 aa, C32S and C34S mutant	Q9BZM6	natural killer cell lectin-like receptor binding	extracellular domain	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f
21575724	Expression, purification and NMR characterization of the cyclic recombinant form of the third intracellular loop of the vasopressin type 2 receptor.	The vasopressin type 2 (V2R) receptor belongs to the class of G-protein coupled receptors. It is mainly expressed in the membrane of kidney tubules, where it is activated by the extracellular arginine vasopressin. In men, inactivating and activating mutations cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and the nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis respectively. Like most GPCRs, V2R&#39;s third intracellular loop (V2R-i3) is involved in the binding and activation of its major effector, the GαS protein. We overexpressed the V2R₂₂₄₋₂₇₄ fragment corresponding to V2R-i3 as a fusion protein with thioredoxin A at the N-terminus and a hexahistidine tag between the two proteins. Recombinant V2R-i3 was designed to harbor N- and C-terminal cysteines, in order to introduce a disulfide bond between N- and C-terminal extremities and hence reproduce the hairpin fold presumably present in the full-length receptor. The fusion protein was produced as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. After a refolding step, thioredoxin and hexahistidine tags were specifically cleaved with the tobacco etch virus protease. The hydrolysis yield, initially very low, increased up to 80% thanks to optimization of buffers and refolding methods. The cleaved fragment, V2₂₂₄₋₂₇₄, devoid of any tag, was then eluted with low imidazole concentrations in a second nickel affinity chromatography in denaturing conditions. The final yield was sufficient to prepare a ¹⁵N-¹³C labeled NMR sample suitable for triple resonance experiments. We assigned all NMR resonances and confirmed the correct peptide sequence. As expected, the peptide forms a hairpin stabilized by a disulfide bond between its N- and C-terminal parts, thus mimicking its native structure in the full-length receptor. This study may provide a strategy for producing and studying the structure/function relationship of GPCR fragments.	2011 Jun	Bellot Gaëtan,Pascal Robert,Mendre Christiane,Urbach Serge,Mouillac Bernard,Déméné Hélène	Protein expression and purification. 78(2) 131-8	vasopressin type 2 receptor	CQVLIFR EIHASLVPGP SERAGRRRRG RRTGSPSEGA HVSAAMAKTV RMTC	N-terminal trx and His6 tag, 224-274 aa, L274C mutant	Q00788	G-protein coupled receptor, Receptor, Transducer		9	20	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f
21584270	Production of Active Nonglycosylated Recombinant B-Chain of Type-2 Ribosome-Inactivating Protein from Viscum articulatum and Its Biological Effects on Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells.	Type-2 ribosome-inactivating proteins, composed of a toxic A-chain and lectin-like B-chain, display various biological functions, including cytotoxicity and immunomodulation. We here cloned the lectin-like B-chain encoding fragment of a newly identified type-2 RIP gene, articulatin gene, from Viscum articulatum, into a bacterial expression vector to obtain nonglycosylated recombinant protein expressed in inclusion bodies. After purification and protein refolding, soluble refolded recombinant articulatin B-chain (rATB) showed lectin activity specific toward galactoside moiety and was stably maintained while stored in low ionic strength solution. Despite lacking glycosylation, rATB actively bound leukocytes with preferential binding to monocytes and in vitro stimulated PBMCs to release cytokines without obvious cytotoxicity. These results implicated such a B-chain fragment as a potential immunomodulator.	2011 May	Lu Tzu-Li,Chuang Jing-Yuan,Yang Jai-Sing,Chiu Shau-Ting,Hsiao Nai-Wan,Wu Mei-Chen,Wu Shih-Hsiung,Hsu Ching-Hsiang	Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM. 2011 283747	Type-2 ribosome-inactivating protein lectin-like B-chain	DDVTCTISEPTVRIVGRNGLCVDVRDNEFHNGNPIQLWACKSNTDPNQLWTIRRDGTIRSNGRCMTTYGYSAGVYVMIFDCNRAAREATLWQIWGNGTIVNPRSNLVLGAASGSSGTTLTVQTLAYSLGQGWLASNDTAPREVTIYGFRDLCMEANGERVWVETCASSKENQKWALYGDGSIRPKQNQGRCLTSQNDSVGTVINIVSCSAGSSGQRWLFTNEGTILNLNSGLVMDVRRSDPSLRQIIIYPATGNPNQMWLPVP	N-terminal His6 tag, 298-560 aa	B3F5I6	rRNA N-glycosylase		8.5		t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
21591783	Cloning, heterologous expression and properties of a recombinant active turnip peroxidase.	Turnip (Brassica napus) roots peroxidase isoforms have been used in diagnostic kits and can also efficiently polymerize phenolic compounds from wastewaters. Heterologous expression of a turnip acidic peroxidase (BnPA) was investigated to increase availability of this widely used enzyme. The mature BnPA was ligated into the pET28a(+) vector and used to transform Escherichia coli Rosetta 2. Recombinant BnPA peroxidase was overexpressed and accumulated in inclusion bodies from which it was purified to homogeneity by immobilized metal affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. Peroxidase activity was observed after a refolding process under oxidative conditions. The yield of pure recombinant BnPA was 29 mg L(-1) of culture with a specific activity of 981 ± 20 ABTS units mg(-1) at optimal conditions (pH 6, 45 °C). Recombinant BnPA showed similar kinetic properties compared to native turnip peroxidase, and its secondary structure evaluated by circular dichroism comprised 20% α-helix, 32% β-sheet and 48% random structure. Recombinant BnPA showed high yield and good kinetic properties which are key steps for future structure-function studies and biotechnological applications.	2011 Jul	Rodriguez-Cabrera Norma A,Regalado C,Garcia-Almendarez Blanca E	Journal of agricultural and food chemistry. 59(13) 7120-6	peroxidase	QLNPTFYSGTCPNVSAIVRSTIEQAPQSDPRIGASLIRLHFHDCFVKGCDGSLLLDDSANIQSEKNAVPNANSTRGFNVVDDIKTALENACPGIVSCSDILALASEASVSLAGGPTWAVLLGRRDGLTANLSGANTGLPSPFEGITNITAKFTAVGLNTTDVVVLSGAHTFGRAACATFNNRLFNFNGTGSPDPTLNSTLLSSLQQLCPQNGSASVVTNLDLSTPDAFDNNYFTNLQSNNGLLQSDQELLSDTGSPTIPIVTSFASNQTQFFEAFALSMIKMGNISPLTGSSGEIRQDCKVVNGQ	1-304 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	Q6JKN8	Oxidoreductase, Peroxidase		8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
21605677	Refolding and characterization of methionine adenosyltransferase from Euglena gracilis.	Methionine adenosyltransferase from Euglena gracilis (MATX) is a recently discovered member of the MAT family of proteins that synthesize S-adenosylmethionine. Heterologous overexpression of MATX in Escherichia coli rendered the protein mostly in inclusion bodies under all conditions tested. Therefore, a refolding and purification procedure from these aggregates was developed to characterize the enzyme. Maximal recovery was obtained using inclusion bodies devoid of extraneous proteins by washing under mild urea (2M) and detergent (5%) concentrations. Refolding was achieved in two steps following solubilization in the presence of Mg(2+); chaotrope dilution to &lt;1M and dialysis under reducing conditions. Purified MATX is a homodimer that exhibits Michaelis kinetics with a V(max) of 1.46 μmol/min/mg and K(m) values of approximately 85 and 260 μM for methionine and ATP, respectively. The activity is dependent on Mg(2+) and K(+) ions, but is not stimulated by dimethylsulfoxide. MATX exhibits tripolyphosphatase activity that is stimulated in the presence of S-adenosylmethionine. Far-UV circular dichroism revealed β-sheet and random coil as the main secondary structure elements of the protein. The high level of sequence conservation allowed construction of a structural model that preserved the main features of the MAT family, the major changes involving the N-terminal domain.	2011 Jul	Garrido Francisco,Estrela Sylvie,Alves Claudia,Sánchez-Pérez Gabino F,Sillero Antonio,Pajares María A	Protein expression and purification. 79(1) 128-36	methionine adenosyltransferase	MAESASKRPRVVQEREFLFSSESVNEGHPDKLCDQVSDSVLDACLAQDPLSKVACETAVKDNMVMVLGEITTQAKLDYEAIVRTAVRNIGFDSFVDDLGSVDSKGLNCDDCEVLVRINKQSPDIAGGVHIGRDEMDVGAGDQGIMFGYATDETESTMPLTHYLATRLGKTLTEVRKDGTLWWLRPDGKTQVTIKYKQCADGAVEPLMIHTILISTQHCEPGKRKKGEEIKGYKGADADEVAPSMDQMNELIIQHVVIRTLQNITLKNGQPAVSIFDRNTCHLHMNPSGKFIIGGPQGDAGLTGRKIIIDTYGGWGAHGGGAFSGKDPTKVDRSAAYITRQIAKSIVVSKLARRALVQLSYAIGVAKPLSVFVETYGSEQGVLTADDITDIVKLTFDCRPGAIGKALQLREPKYVETAAYCHFGREPRTENGIKYFEWENPVDLSKYASYSSAQVKEEVAARKAEVLQKWVD		D7PVZ2	Transferase	full length	8		t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
21605679	Expression, purification, and refolding of active human and mouse secreted group IIE phospholipase A₂.	Secreted phospholipase A₂s form a large family of proteins involved in diverse biological and pathophysiological processes. Group IIE secreted phospholipase A₂ (sPLA₂-IIE) is one of the latest discovered members of this family. Previous studies revealed that the expression profile of sPLA₂-IIE was restricted to a few tissue types including brain, heart, lung and placenta compared to the broad expression profile of other isoforms. Accumulating evidence suggests that sPLA₂-IIE might play a pivotal role in the progression of inflammatory processes. However, functional study of sPLA₂-IIE was hindered by the low yield of soluble expressed protein. In this study, we have expressed human and mouse sPLA₂-IIE in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were dissolved, purified and refolded in a step-wise dialysis approach and further purified. We obtained soluble and active proteins for human and mouse sPLA₂-IIE with a final yield of 1.1 and 1.2 mg/500 mL bacterial culture, respectively. The refolded sPLA₂-IIEs exhibited similar calcium and pH dependence of their enzymatic activity with those expressed in COS cells. This protein expression and purification protocol will facilitate the further structural and functional studies of human and mouse sPLA₂-IIEs.	2011 Sep	Zhang Yujie,Xu Tingting,Chen Qiujia,Wang Bing,Liu Jinsong	Protein expression and purification. 80(1) 68-73	Group IIE secreted phospholipase A2	NLVQFGVMIEKMTGKSALQYNDYGCYCGIGGSHWPVDQTDWCCHAHDCCYGRLEKLGCEPKLEKYLFSVSERGIFCAGRTTCQRLTCECDKRAALCFRRNLGTYNRKYAHYPNKLCTGPTPPC	without signal peptide, C-terminal His6 tag	Q9NZK7	phospholipase A2, Hydrolase		7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

21608142	High-pressure refolding of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) recombinantly expressed in bacterial inclusion bodies: refolding optimization, and feasibility assessment.	High-pressure has been established as an effective technique for refolding proteins at high concentrations. In this study, high hydrostatic pressure (1-3 kbar) was utilized to refold a homodimeric protein from inclusion bodies and the process was evaluated for large-scale manufacturing feasibility. This research focused on increasing protein concentration while maximizing yield and product quality. Refolding yields of 29-42% were achieved in the absence of urea at 2 kbar and at a protein concentration of 6 g/L. Optimization of the refolding buffer composition via multivariate design of experiments and other process parameters such as refolding pressure, gas sparging, and time under pressure are discussed. Although high-pressure refolding can be considered a viable technology for manufacturing if the gains are clearly identified, in this particular case, the benefits that the high-pressure technology offers do not compensate for the drawbacks of implementing new equipment in an existing facility, and unknown impact of scale-up for this molecule.	2011 Oct	Cothran Amber,St John Richard J,Schmelzer Charles H,Pizarro Shelly A	Biotechnology progress. 27(5) 1273-81	vascular endothelial growth factor	GQNHHEVVKFMDVYQRSYCHPIETLVDIFQEYPDEIEYIFKPSCVPLMRCGGCCNDEGLECVPTEESNITMQIMRIKPHQGQHIGEMSFLQHNKCECRPKKD	34-135 aa	P15692	Developmental protein, Growth factor, Mitogen	receptor binding domain	9.5		f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
21617989	WCI, a novel wheat chymotrypsin inhibitor: purification, primary structure, inhibitory properties and heterologous expression.	A novel chymotrypsin inhibitor, detected in the endosperm of Triticum aestivum, was purified and characterized with respect to the main physical-chemical properties. On the basis of its specificity, this inhibitor was named WCI (wheat chymotrypsin inhibitor). WCI is a monomeric neutral protein made up of 119 residues and molecular mass value of 12,933.40 Da. Automated sequence and mass spectrometry analyses, carried out on several samples of purified inhibitor, evidenced an intrinsic molecular heterogeneity due to the presence of the isoform [des-(Thr)WCI], accounting for about 400f the total sample. In vitro, WCI acted as a strong inhibitor of bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin as well as of chymotryptic-like activities isolated from the midgut of two phytophagous insects, Helicoverpa armigera (Hüb.) and Tenebrio molitor L., respectively. No inhibitory activities were detected against bacterial subtilisins, bovine pancreatic trypsin, porcine pancreatic elastase or human leukocyte elastase. The primary structure of WCI was significantly similar (45.7-89.1%) to those of several proteins belonging to the cereal trypsin/α-amylase inhibitor super-family and showed the typical sequence motif of this crowed protein group. The cDNA of the inhibitor (wci-cDNA) was isolated from wheat immature caryopses and employed to obtain a recombinant product in E. coli. Experimental evidences indicated that the recombinant inhibitor was localized in the inclusion bodies from which it was recovered as soluble and partially active protein by applying an appropriate refolding procedure. WCI reactive site localization, as well as its inhibitory specificity, was investigated by molecular modeling approach.	2011 Sep	Di Maro Antimo,Farisei Francesca,Panichi Daniela,Severino Valeria,Bruni Natalia,Ficca Anna Grazia,Ferranti Pasquale,Capuzzi Valeria,Tedeschi Francesca,Poerio Elia	Planta. 234(4) 723-35	wheat chymotrypsin inhibitor	TSIYTCYEGVGLPVDPLQGCHYYVTSQTCGFVPLLPIEVMKDRCCRELAAISSNCRCEGLRVFIDRAFPPSQSQGGGPPQPPLAPRCPTEVKRDFARTLALPGQCNLPTIHGGPYCVFP	C-terminal His6 tag	P83207	Protease inhibitor, Serine protease inhibitor	full length	8.0	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21655243	Enhanced in vitro refolding of fibroblast growth factor 15 with the assistance of SUMO fusion partner.	Fibroblast growth factor 15 (Fgf15) is the mouse orthologue of human FGF19. Fgf15 is highly expressed in the ileum and functions as an endocrine signal to regulate liver function, including bile acid synthesis, hepatocyte proliferation and insulin sensitivity. In order to fully understand the function of Fgf15, methods are needed to produce pure Fgf15 protein in the prokaryotic system. However, when expressed in Escherichia coli (E. coli), the recombinant Fgf15 protein was insoluble and found only in inclusion bodies. In the current study, we report a method to produce recombinant Fgf15 protein in E. coli through the use of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion tag. Even though the SUMO has been shown to strongly improve protein solubility and expression levels, our studies suggest that the SUMO does not improve Fgf15 protein solubility. Instead, proper refolding of Fgf15 protein was achieved when Fgf15 was expressed as a partner protein of the fusion tag SUMO, followed by in vitro dialysis refolding. After refolding, the N-terminal SUMO tag was cleaved from the recombinant Fgf15 fusion protein by ScUlp1 (Ubiquitin-Like Protein-Specific Protease 1 from S. cerevisiae). With or without the SUMO tag, the refolded Fgf15 protein was biologically active, as revealed by its ability to reduce hepatic Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in mice. In addition, recombinant Fgf15 protein suppressed Cyp7a1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. In summary, we have developed a successful method to express functional Fgf15 protein in prokaryotic cells.	2011 Jun	Kong Bo,Guo Grace L	PloS one. 6(5) e20307	Fibroblast growth factor 15	MARKWNGRAVARALVLATLWLAVSGRPLAQQSQSVSDEDPLFLYGWGKITRLQYLYSAGPYVSNCFLRIRSDGSVDCEEDQNERNLLEFRAVALKTIAIKDVSSVRYLCMSADGKIYGLIRYSEEDCTFREEMDCLGYNQYRSMKHHLHIIFIQAKPREQLQDQKPSNFIPVFHRSFFETGDQLRSKMFSLPLESDSMDPFRMVEDVDHLVKSPSFQK	N-terminal His6 tag	O35622	Growth factor	full length	8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

Here, we describe technical issues we have encountered in production of recombinant zinc finger nucleic acid-binding proteins by IMAC intended for detailed and accurate in vitro analysis. The process encountered leading to a modified IMAC protocol for effective production of high-purity, native zinc finger nucleic acid-binding proteins is described in detail. The parameters with respect to solubility, lysis and redox conditions, removal of residual metal ions with chelating agents, and renaturation in the presence of divalent metal cations are described. These procedures have been extended to production of a wide array of RNA-binding proteins in our laboratory and would be relevant to a number of protein purification applications.	2011 Jun	Belak Zachery R,Nair Manoj,Ovsenek Nick	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 58(3) 166-74	Yin Yang 1	MASGDTLYIASDGSEMPAEIVELHEIEVECIPVETIETTVVGDDEDDDDDQGHHQQPMIALQPLDSDDLVHPHHQEVILVQTREEVVGGDDSDLRADDGYEDQILIPVPVPAGEDEYIEQTLVTVAGKSSSGGRMKKGGGGSGKKSSKKSYLSGTEPSGRKWEQKQVQIKTLEGEFSVTMWASDDKKDIDHETVVEEQIIGENSPPDYSEYMTGKKLPPGGIPGIDLSDPKQLAEFASETRCTNNINGRKKQAPSWRMKPRKIKEDDAPRTIACPHKGCTKMFRDNSAMRKHLHTHGPRVHVCAECGKAFVESSKLKRHQLVHTGEKPFQCTFEGCGKRFSLDFNLRTHVRIHTGDRPYVCPFDGCNKKFAQSTNLKSHILTHAKAKNNQ	N-terminal His6 tag	Q6DDI1	metal ion binding, nucleic acid binding	full length	7.5	4	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
21679242	Expression, purification, and characterization of protective MPT64 antigen protein and identification of its multimers isolated from nontoxic Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra.	MPT64, a secreted protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), stimulates the immune reactions within cells and is a protective antigen that is lost by the bacilli Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine during propagation. To minimize the toxicity caused by MTB, we used the MPT64 gene encoded by nontoxic H37Ra MTB to carry out genetic expansion via polymerase chain reaction and gene clone MPT64. The plasmid DNA encoded MPT64 was expressed at 20°C for 22 H, and a large quantity of MPT64 was obtained. In the absence of urea, MPT64 multimers with subunits being covalently connected via disulfide bonds were detected by Western blot showing strong protein-protein interactions, as evidenced by the formation of MPT64 tetramers. Finally, with urea of decreasing concentrations, we refolded MPT64 purified in the presence of urea and determined its secondary structures using circular dichroism. MPT64 was found to contain 2.2% α-helix, 50.9% β-sheet, 19.50rn, and 27.4% random coil. The molecular weight of MPT64 was determined by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometer and found to be 23,497 Da, very close to the theoretical molecular weight of MPT64. The results presented here provide a sound basis for future biochemical and biophysical studies of MPT64 or any other proteins encoded by nontoxic H37Ra MTB.	2011 Jun	Chu Teng-Ping J,Yuann Jeu-Ming P	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 58(3) 185-9	MPT64	MRIKIFMLVTAVVLLCCSGVATAAPKTYCEELKGTDTGQACQIQMSDPAYNINISLPSYYPDQKSLENYIAQTRDKFLSAATSSTPREAPYELNITSATYQSAIPPRGTQAVVLKVYQNAGGTHPTTTYKAFDWDQAYRKPITYDTLWQADTDPLPVVFPIVQGELSKQTGQQVSIAPNAGLDPVNYQNFAVTNDGVIFFFNPGELLPEAAGPTQVLVPRSAIDSMLA	C-terminal His6 tag	A5U400		full length	8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
21682850	Lytic activity of the virion-associated peptidoglycan hydrolase HydH5 of Staphylococcus aureus bacteriophage vB_SauS-phiIPLA88.	BACKGROUND:Staphylococcus aureus is a food-borne pathogen and the most common cause of infections in hospitalized patients. The increase in the resistance of this pathogen to antibacterials has made necessary the development of new anti-staphylococcal agents. In this context, bacteriophage lytic enzymes such as endolysins and structural peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolases have received considerable attention as possible antimicrobials against gram-positive bacteria.RESULTS:S. aureus bacteriophage vB_SauS-phiIPLA88 (phiIPLA88) contains a virion-associated muralytic enzyme (HydH5) encoded by orf58, which is located in the morphogenetic module. Comparative bioinformatic analysis revealed that HydH5 significantly resembled other peptidoglycan hydrolases encoded by staphylococcal phages. The protein consists of 634 amino acid residues. Two putative lytic domains were identified: an N-terminal CHAP (cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase) domain (135 amino acid residues), and a C-terminal LYZ2 (lysozyme subfamily 2) domain (147 amino acid residues). These domains were also found when a predicted three-dimensional structure of HydH5 was made which provided the basis for deletion analysis. The complete HydH5 protein and truncated proteins containing only each catalytic domain were overproduced in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies by subsequent refolding. Truncated and full-length HydH5 proteins were all able to bind and lyse S. aureus Sa9 cells as shown by binding assays, zymogram analyses and CFU reduction analysis. HydH5 demonstrated high antibiotic activity against early exponential cells, at 45°C and in the absence of divalent cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+). Thermostability assays showed that HydH5 retained 720f its activity after 5 min at 100°C.CONCLUSIONS:The virion-associated PG hydrolase HydH5 has lytic activity against S. aureus, which makes it attractive as antimicrobial for food biopreservation and anti-staphylococcal therapy.	2011 Aug	Rodríguez Lorena,Martínez Beatriz,Zhou Yuan,Rodríguez Ana,Donovan David M,García Pilar	BMC microbiology. 11 138	HydH5	MGLPNPKDRKPTASEVVEWALYMAKNRRVIDVDRSYGGQCWDVPNYILERYWGFRTWGNANAMAQKSNYRGRDFKIYRNTASFTPKPGDWAVWANRNPGHVAIVVGPADKNAFVSVDQNWYTANWSGSPPYKIKHTYHDGPGGVTHFVRPPYHPDKTTPAPQPVPKPKDDSDDKEKNNKKVPIWKDVKTIKYTISSQVVNYPEYIYHFIVEGNRRLEKPKGIMIRNAQTMSSVENLYNSRKKYKQDVEYPHFYVDRHNIWAPRRAVFEVPNEPDYIVIDVCEDYSASKNEFIFNEIYAMGVAVDMMVEYEIPLSIENLKVDDSIWRSMLEHVNWNMIDNGVPPKDKYEALEKALLNIFKNREKLLNSITKPTVTKSRIKVMVDNKNADIANVRDSSPTANNGSASKQPQIITETSPYTFKQALDRQMSRGNPKKSHTWGWANATRAQTSSSMNVKRIWESNTQCYQMLNLGKYQGVSVSSLNKILKGKGTLNNQGKAFAEACKKHNINEIYLIAHAFLESGYGTSNFASGKDGVYNYFGIGAYDNNPNYAMTFARNKGWTSPAKAIMGGASFVRKDYINKGQNTLYRIRWNPKNPATHQYATAIEWCQHQASTIAKLYKQIGLKGVYFTRDKYK	N-terminal His6 tag	B7T0E8	amidase	full length	7.5		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

21687929	Expression, purification, refolding, and characterization of octreotide-interleukin-2: a chimeric tumor-targeting protein.	The targeting of tumor cells by peptides for drug delivery is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), which mediates anti-tumor cellular immune responses, has been approved as a therapy for cancer. However, the serious side effects and short half-life of recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2) has limited its use clinically. Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), which are expressed in a large number of human tumors, are the targets for in vivo tumor targeting. In this study, we have constructed and expressed a novel chimeric recombinant protein containing octreotide analogs and IL-2 in order to target the SSTR binding with tumor cells. The fusion protein somatostatin receptor targeted interleukin-2 (SIL), which was purified from bacterial inclusion bodies and refolded with high purity, was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Tryptophan emission fluorescence was used to measure the structural changes in SIL after renaturation. Cell proliferation experiments showed that this chimeric protein retained the biological activities of hIL-2. Furthermore, the tumor binding capacity of SIL acting through SSTRs was shown through co-immunoprecipitation. Competition binding with octreotide of tumor cells also confirmed that SIL binds to tumor cells through the target peptide octreotide. Moreover, the performance of SIL in stimulating the proliferation of lymphocyte cell lines after binding to tumor cells showed that the immunocytokine, SIL, retained its bioactivity at the tumor site. These results suggest that SIL is a recombinant fusion protein that may be used for tumor-targeted drug delivery.	2011 Jul	Jiang Jing,Deng Leixiu,He Lichun,Liu Haiting,Wang Changhai	International journal of molecular medicine. 28(4) 549-56	Interleukin-2		C-terminal His6 tag, N-terminal octreotide(FCFWKTCT) fusion protein	P60568	Cytokine, Growth factor		8.6		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	f
21707922	C-Terminal extension of a plant cysteine protease modulates proteolytic activity through a partial inhibitory mechanism.	The amino acid sequence of ervatamin-C, a thermostable cysteine protease from a tropical plant, revealed an additional 24-amino-acid extension at its C-terminus (CT). The role of this extension peptide in zymogen activation, catalytic activity, folding and stability of the protease is reported. For this study, we expressed two recombinant forms of the protease in Escherichia coli, one retaining the CT-extension and the other with it truncated. The enzyme with the extension shows autocatalytic zymogen activation at a higher pH of 8.0, whereas deletion of the extension results in a more active form of the enzyme. This CT-extension was not found to be cleaved during autocatalysis or by limited proteolysis by different external proteases. Molecular modeling and simulation studies revealed that the CT-extension blocks some of the substrate-binding unprimed subsites including the specificity-determining subsite (S2) of the enzyme and thereby partially occludes accessibility of the substrates to the active site, which also corroborates the experimental observations. The CT-extension in the model structure shows tight packing with the catalytic domain of the enzyme, mediated by strong hydrophobic and H-bond interactions, thus restricting accessibility of its cleavage sites to the protease itself or to the external proteases. Kinetic stability analyses (T(50) and t(1/2) ) and refolding experiments show similar thermal stability and refolding efficiency for both forms. These data suggest that the CT-extension has an inhibitory role in the proteolytic activity of ervatamin-C but does not have a major role either in stabilizing the enzyme or in its folding mechanism.	2011 Aug	Dutta Sruti,Choudhury Debi,Dattagupta Jiban K,Biswas Sampa	The FEBS journal. 278(17) 3012-24	Ervatamin-C	MDISTIEYKYDKSSAWRTDEEVKEIYELWLAKHDKVYSGLVEYEKRFEIFKDNLKFIDEHNSENHTYKMGLTPYTDLTNEEFQAIYLGTRSDTIHRLKRTINISERYAYEAGDNLPEQIDWRKKGAVTPVKNQGKCGSCWAFSTVSTVESINQIRTGNLISLSEQQLVDCNKKNHGCKGGAFVYAYQYIIDNGGIDTEANYPYKAVQGPCRAAKKVVRIDGYKGVPHCNENALKKAVASQPSVVAIDASSKQFQHYKSGIFSGPCGTKLNHGVVIVGYWKDYWIVRNSWGRYWGEQGYIRMKRVGGCGLCGIARLPYYPTKAAGDENSKLETPELLQWSEEAFPLA	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag	A8DS38	Hydrolase, Protease, Thiol protease				f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

21712092	A simple approach for human recombinant apolipoprotein E4 expression and purification.	We report a simple expression and purification procedure for the production of recombinant apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), an important protein for the lipid homeostasis in humans that plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Our approach is based on the expression of a thioredoxin-apoE4 fusion construct in bacterial cells and subsequent removal of the fused thioredoxin using the highly specific 3C protease, avoiding costly and laborious lipidation-delipidation steps used before. Our approach results in rapid, high-yield production of structurally and functionally competent apoE4 as evidenced by secondary structure measurements, thermal and chemical melting profiles and the kinetic profile of solubilization of dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles. This protocol is appropriate for laboratories with little experience in apolipoprotein biochemistry and will facilitate future studies on the role of apoE4 in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#39;s disease.	2011 Aug	Argyri Letta,Skamnaki Vassiliki,Stratikos Efstratios,Chroni Angeliki	Protein expression and purification. 79(2) 251-7	apolipoprotein E4	KVEQAVETEPEPELRQQTEWQSGQRWELALGRFWDYLRWVQTLSEQVQEELLSSQVTQELRALMDETMKELKAYKSELEEQLTPVAEETRARLSKELQAAQARLGADMEDVRGRLVQYRGEVQAMLGQSTEELRVRLASHLRKLRKRLLRDADDLQKRLAVYQAGAREGAERGLSAIRERLGPLVEQGRVRAATVGSLAGQPLQERAQAWGERLRARMEEMGSRTRDRLDEVKEQVAEVRAKLEEQAQQIRLQAEAFQARLKSWFEPLVEDMQRQWAGLVEKVQAAVGTSAAPVPSDNH	without signal peptide, C130R mutant	P02649	lipid transporter		7.4	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

21718537	Optimizing HIV-1 protease production in Escherichia coli as fusion protein.	BACKGROUND:Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent in AIDS and related diseases. The aspartyl protease encoded by the 5&#39; portion of the pol gene is responsible for proteolytic processing of the gag-pol polyprotein precursor to yield the mature capsid protein and the reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes. The HIV protease (HIV-1Pr) is considered an attractive target for designing inhibitors which could be used to tackle AIDS and therefore it is still the object of a number of investigations.RESULTS:A recombinant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease (HIV-1Pr) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells as a fusion protein with bacterial periplasmic protein dithiol oxidase (DsbA) or glutathione S-transferase (GST), also containing a six-histidine tag sequence. Protein expression was optimized by designing a suitable HIV-1Pr cDNA (for E. coli expression and to avoid autoproteolysis) and by screening six different E. coli strains and five growth media. The best expression yields were achieved in E. coli BL21-Codon Plus(DE3)-RIL host and in TB or M9 medium to which 1% (w/v) glucose was added to minimize basal expression. Among the different parameters assayed, the presence of a buffer system (based on phosphate salts) and a growth temperature of 37°C after adding IPTG played the main role in enhancing protease expression (up to 10 mg of chimeric DsbA:HIV-1Pr/L fermentation broth). GST:HIVPr was in part (50%) produced as soluble protein while the overexpressed DsbA:HIV-1Pr chimeric protein largely accumulated in inclusion bodies as unprocessed fusion protein. A simple refolding procedure was developed on HiTrap Chelating column that yielded a refolded DsbA:HIV-1Pr with a &gt; 80% recovery. Finally, enterokinase digestion of resolubilized DsbA:HIV-1Pr gave more than 2 mg of HIV-1Pr per liter of fermentation broth with a purity ≤ 80%, while PreScission protease cleavage of soluble GST:HIVPr yielded ~ 0.15 mg of pure HIV-1Pr per liter.CONCLUSIONS:By using this optimized expression and purification procedure fairly large amounts of good-quality HIV-1Pr recombinant enzyme can be produced at the lab-scale and thus used for further biochemical studies.	2011 Jul	Volontè Federica,Piubelli Luciano,Pollegioni Loredano	Microbial cell factories. 10 53	HIV-1 protease	PQVTLWKRPLVTIKIGGQLKEALLDTGADDTVIEEMSLPGRWKPKMIGGIGGFIKVRQYDQIIIEICGHKAIGTVLVGPTPVNIIGRNLLTQIGATLNF	N-terminal DsbA and His6 tag, C-terminal His6 tag, Q7K, L33I, L63I, C95A mutant	Q72874	aspartic-type endopeptidase	full length	8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
21745574	L-cysteine-enhanced renaturation of bioactive soluble tumor necrosis factor ligand family member LIGHT from inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.	LIGHT is a membrane-bound protein that belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily ligands. In this study, we established an effective strategy for producing a bioactive soluble form of LIGHT (sLIGHT), an extracellular region (Ile⁸⁴-Val²⁴⁰) of human LIGHT. Because sLIGHT was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, we investigated reagents that enhance the renaturation of sLIGHT from the inclusion bodies. Interestingly, L-cysteine in the denaturation buffer containing 3.5 M guanidine hydrochloride significantly improved the renaturation efficiency of sLIGHT. The effect of L-cysteine was synergistically enhanced by L-arginine in the refolding buffer. The optimal concentrations of L-cysteine and L-arginine in the denaturation and refolding buffers were 8 mM and 0.8 M, respectively. With these buffers, approximately 90 mg of sLIGHT was purified from 200 g of frozen E. coli cells. sLIGHT thus obtained significantly induced apoptosis in the WiDr human colon adenocarcinoma cell line at nanomolar concentrations, the same amount of sLIGHT that was produced by Sf9 insect cells. These results suggest that L-cysteine in the denaturation buffer enhances the renaturation of recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies in E. coli.	2011 Oct	Tsuji Isamu,Mastui Hideki,Ito Tatsuo,Kurokawa Tomofumi,Shintani Yasushi	Protein expression and purification. 80(2) 239-45	LIGHT	IQERRSHEVNPAAHLTGANSSLTGSGGPLLWETQLGLAFLRGLSYHDGALVVTKAGYYYIYSKVQLGGVGCPLGLASTITHGLYKRTPRYPEELELLVSQQSPCGRATSSSRVWWDSSFLGGVVHLEAGEKVVVRVLDERLVRLRDGTRSYFGAFMV		O43557	Cytokine	extracellular region	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21757010	Expression, refolding and purification of Ov-GRN-1, a granulin-like growth factor from the carcinogenic liver fluke, that causes proliferation of mammalian host cells.	Granulins (GRNs) are potent growth factors that are upregulated in many aggressive cancers from a wide range of organs. GRNs form tight, disulphide bonded, beta hairpin stacks, making them difficult to express in recombinant form. We recently described Ov-GRN-1, a GRN family member secreted by the carcinogenic liver fluke of humans, Opisthorchis viverrini, and showed that recombinant Ov-GRN-1 expressed and refolded from Escherichia coli caused proliferation of mammalian cell lines at nanomolar concentrations. We now report on an optimized method to express and purify monomeric Ov-GRN-1 in E. coli using a straightforward and scalable purification and refolding process. Purified monomeric protein caused proliferation at nanomolar concentrations of cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines derived from human bile duct tissue. The expression and purification method we describe herein will serve as a backbone upon which to develop expression and purification processes for recombinant GRNs from other organisms, accelerating research on this intriguing family of proteins.	2011 Aug	Smout Michael J,Mulvenna Jason P,Jones Malcolm K,Loukas Alex	Protein expression and purification. 79(2) 263-70	granulin-like protein	MDTLQPIRSPSCPDPVYTCRPGQTCCRGLHGYGCCPMDSATCCSDLLHCCPHGTACTAYGLCVRGDHKLLSRALQIMLNARKVA	N-terminal His6 tag, without signal peptide	B8XSI4			5.8	4	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
21764804	An efficient method for refolding the extracellular portion of CD147 from the total bacterial lysate.	CD147 is a widely expressed transmembrane protein that mediates signal transduction, and it plays important roles in many physiological and pathological processes, such as tumor invasion and metastasis. The extracellular portion of CD147 (CD147(EC)) is responsible for its functional interactions with different signaling molecules. Due to the existence of two disulfide bonds, CD147(EC) is mainly expressed as an inclusion body in Escherichia coli. Here, we report a convenient rapid-dilution refolding protocol that enables the refolding of CD147(EC) efficiently from total bacterial lysate instead of pure inclusion bodies. Using this method, over 25 mg of CD147(EC) can be purified from 1 l of bacterial culture in M9 medium. The refolded CD147(EC) is well folded as characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and it can induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in fibroblast cells. The described protocol is also applicable to the refolding of two immunoglobulin domains of CD147(EC) individually. Interestingly, we noticed that little protein was produced for the C-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig) domain of CD147(EC) by bacteria in M9 medium, even though it was overexpressed in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. However, when the pH of the bacterial culture in M9 medium was adjusted in accordance with that in LB medium during growth, comparable expression level could be achieved.	2011 Oct	Song Fei,Zhang Xin,Li Yifei,Ru Qiang,Ren Xiaobai,Xia Bin,Chen Zhi-Nan	Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica. 43(11) 900-8	CD147	AAGTVFTTVEDLGSKILLTCSLNDSATEVTGHRWLKGGVVLKEDALPGQKTEFKVDSDDQWGEYSCVFLPEPMGTANIQLHGPPRVKAVKSSEHINEGETAMLVCKSESVPPVTDWAWYKITDSEDKALMNGSESRFFVSSSQGRSELHIENLNMEADPGQYRCNGTSSKGSDQAIITLRVRSH	22-205 aa(UniProt ID:P35613-2), C-terminal His6 tag	P35613	Blood group antigen	extracellular domain	8.0	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f

21791244	Molecular recruitment as a basis for negative dominant inheritance? propagation of misfolding in oligomers of IMPDH1, the mutated enzyme in the RP10 form of retinitis pigmentosa.	Retinitis pigmentosa, causing progressive blindness, is genetically heterogeneous. RP10, due to a defect in inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH1), shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Recombinantly expressed clinical mutants show unaltered kinetic behaviour. It is unclear why reportedly impaired DNA binding is important and how it would explain negative dominance. An alternative view relates to the mutant proteins&#39; tendency to aggregate. Regarding negative dominance, a key question is whether the defective protein can subvert the function of its normal counterpart in the same cell. Potentially, the homotetrameric structure of IMPDH1 might offer a vehicle for such an effect. We have established a reliable protocol for reproducible refolding of recombinantly expressed IMPDH1 in vitro. Clinical mutants R224P and D226N both show impaired folding. For equimolar mixtures of normal and mutant enzymes, independent refolding would predict activity regain midway between pure mutant and pure normal. Under various conditions regain is close to the mutant figure, suggesting that, in hybrid tetramers, mutant subunits impose their faulty conformation on normal partners. The observed molecular recruitment is a negative counterpart of the intra-allelic complementation, also mediated via oligomeric structure and postulated many years ago by Fincham. These findings appear potentially to account for the negative dominant inheritance. This interpretation must be provisional at present, as the predominant transcript in retina is an alternatively spliced version not fully identical to that used in our study. The results nevertheless have a general significance in pointing to a mechanism for negative dominance that could be widespread.	2011 Oct	Wang Xiao-Tao,Mion Brian,Aherne Aileen,Engel Paul C	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1812(11) 1472-6	inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1	MADYLISGGTGYVPEDGLTAQQLFASADGLTYNDFLILPGFIDFIADEVDLTSALTRKITLKTPLISSPMDTVTEADMAIAMALMGGIGFIHHNCTPEFQANEVRKVKKFEQGFITDPVVLSPSHTVGDVLEAKMRHGFSGIPITETGTMGSKLVGIVTSRDIDFLAEKDHTTLLSEVMTPRIELVVAPAGVTLKEANEILQRSKKGKLPIVNDCDELVAIIARTDLKKNRDYPLASKDSQKQLLCGAAVGTREDDKYRLDLLTQAGVDVIVLDSSQGNSVYQIAMVHYIKQKYPHLQVIGGNVVTAAQAKNLIDAGVDGLRVGMGCGSICITQEVMACGRPQGTAVYKVAEYARRFGVPIIADGGIQTVGHVVKALALGASTVMMGSLLAATTEAPGEYFFSDGVRLKKYRGMGSLDAMEKSSSSQKRYFSEGDKVKIAQGVSGSIQDKGSIQKFVPYLIAGIQHGCQDIGARSLSVLRSMMYSGELKFEKRTMSAQIEGGVHGLHSYEKRLY		P20839	Oxidoreductase, IMP dehydrogenase	full length	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

21806689	The prion-like protein Doppel enhances ovine spermatozoa fertilizing ability.	The function of prion-like protein Doppel was suggested to be related to male fertility. In this study, the importance of ovine Doppel polypeptide on spermatozoa capacitation and fertilization was evaluated. After refolding, recombinant Doppel (rDpl) was supplemented with different concentrations (40, 80 or 190 ng/ml) to ovine spermatozoa during the capacitation process. In experiment 1, post-thawed ovine spermatozoa were incubated with different concentrations of rDpl during 1 h for swim-up, and changes in sperm motility, concentration, vigour, viability and capacitation were monitored (10 replicates). In experiment 2, the fertilization ability of post-swim-up spermatozoa incubated as above was tested through heterologous fertilization of bovine in vitro matured oocytes (n = 423, three replicates). Regardless of dosage, rDpl improved (p ≤ 0.03) spermatozoa viability. Sperm individual motility and vigour were the highest (p ≤ 0.04) for the group receiving 190 ng/ml rDpl. Sperm supplemented with the highest doses of rDpl achieved higher (p = 0.02) fertilization rates (56.0 ± 3.0%) than control (39.1 ± 2.2%) and 40 ng/ml rDpl (39.8 ± 2.7%). Preliminary data suggest that Doppel protein may enhance in vitro spermatozoa fertilizing ability.	2012 Mar	Pimenta J,Dias F M V,Marques C C,Baptista M C,Vasques M I,Horta A E M,Barbas J P,Soares R,Mesquita P,Cabrita E,Fontes C M G A,Prates J A,Pereira R M	Reproduction in domestic animals = Zuchthygiene. 47(2) 196-202	prion-like protein Doppel	RGIKHRIKWNRKVLPSTSQVTEAHTAEIRPGAFIKQGRKLDINFGVEGNRYYEANYWQFPDGIHYNGCSEANVTKEKFVTSCINATQVANQEELSREKQDNKLYQRVLWQLIRELCSIKHCDFWLER	27-153 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	Q9GJY2	Prion		8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21837279	Purification and Refolding of Overexpressed Human Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor in Escherichia coli.	This work describes the integration of expanded bed adsorption (EBA) and adsorptive protein refolding operations used to recover purified and biologically active human basic fibroblast growth factor from inclusion bodies expressed in E. coli. Insoluble overexpressed human basic fibroblast growth factor has been purified on CM Hyper Z matrix by expanded bed adsorption after isolation and solubilization in 8 M urea. The adsorption was made in expanded bed without clarification steps such as centrifugation. Column refolding was done by elimination of urea and elution with NaCl. The human basic fibroblast growth factor was obtained as a highly purified soluble monomer form with similar behavior in circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy as native protein. A total of 92.520f the available human basic fibroblast growth factor was recovered as biologically active and purified protein using the mentioned purification and refolding process. This resulted in the first procedure describing high-throughput purification and refolding of human basic fibroblast growth factor in one step and is likely to have the greatest benefit for proteins that tend to aggregate when refolded by dilution.	2011 Aug	Alibolandi Mona,Mirzahoseini Hasan	Biotechnology research international. 2011 973741	Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor	PALPEDGGSGAFPPGHFKDPKRLYCKNGGFFLRIHPDGRVDGVREKSDPHIKLQLQAEERGVVSIKGVCANRYLAMKEDGRLLASKCVTDECFFFERLESNNYNTYRSRKYTSWYVALKRTGQYKLGSKTGPGQKAILFLPMSAKS	143-288 aa	P09038	Developmental protein, Growth factor, Mitogen		7.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
21841133	Recognition of class I MHC by a rat Ly49 NK cell receptor is dependent on the identity of the P2 anchor amino acid of bound peptide.	Members of the rodent Ly49 receptor family control NK cell responsiveness and demonstrate allele specificity for MHC class I (MHC-I) ligands. For example, the rat Ly49i2 inhibitory NK cell receptor binds RT1-A1(c) but not other rat MHC class Ia or Ib molecules. RT1-A1(c) preferentially binds peptides with proline at the second, or P2, position, which defines it as an HLA-B7 supertype MHC-I molecule. Previously, our laboratory showed that mutations within the MHC-I supertype-defining B-pocket of RT1-A1(c) could lead to alterations in P2 anchor residues of the peptide repertoire bound by RT1-A1(c) and loss of recognition by Ly49i2. Although suggestive of peptide involvement, it was unclear whether the peptide P2 anchor residue or alteration of the RT1-A1(c) primary sequence influenced Ly49i2 recognition. Therefore, we directly investigated the role of the P2 anchor residue of RT1-A1(c)-bound peptides in Ly49i2 recognition. First, fluorescent multimers generated by refolding soluble recombinant RT1-A1(c) with individual synthetic peptides differing only at the P2 anchor residue were examined for binding to Ly49i2 NK cell transfectants. Second, cytotoxicity by Ly49i2-expressing NK cells toward RMA-S target cells expressing RT1-A1(c) bound with peptides that only differ at the P2 anchor residue was evaluated. Our results demonstrate that Ly49i2 recognizes RT1-A1(c) bound with peptides that have Pro or Val at P2, whereas little or no recognition is observed when RT1-A1(c) is complexed with peptide bearing Gln at P2. Thus, the identity of the P2 peptide anchor residue is an integral component of MHC-I recognition by Ly49i2.	2011 Sep	Ma Brian J,Kane Kevin P	Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950). 187(6) 3267-76	Beta-2-microglobulin	IQKTPQIQVYSRHPPENGKPNFLNCYVSQFHPPQIEIELLKNGKKIPNIEMSDLSFSKDWSFYILAHTEFTPTETDVYACRVKHVTLKEPKTVTWDRDM	without signal peptide	P07151			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

21842387	Cloning, expression, and characterization of salivary apyrase from Aedes albopictus.	Apyrases (ATP diphosphohydrolase) hydrolyze the phosphodiester bonds of nucleoside tri- and diphosphates to orthophosphate and mononucleodides. They can inhibit platelet activation by depletion of adenosine diphosphate. In the current study, the Escherichia coli expression vector pET-19b equipped with an N-terminal histidine tag was applied to express the apyrase of Aedes albopictus. The gene-coding mature apyrase protein was amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into pET-19b. Soluble apyrase protein with high purity was successfully obtained by utilization of the suitable renaturation approach and Ni-NTA purification column. Four monoclonal antibodies to apyrase from A. albopictus were produced in male BALB/c mice immunized with the renatured apyrase. Using immunofluorescence assay and immunoblotting analysis, recombinant apyrase showed fine consistency with native apyrase. From kinetic analysis, it had a K (m) of 11.6 μM and V (max) of 1.02 nM/S/μg protein for adenosine triphosphate. Adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation was inhibited by approximately 6% when 0.4 μM recombinant apyrase was added and by about 9.5% when the concentration of recombinant apyrase was 0.8 μM. The effect on platelet aggregation was dose dependent. In conclusion, the apyrase of A. albopictus was cloned and expressed highly in the E. coli expression system. Recombinant apyrase protein showed biological activity, and anti-apyrase monoclonal antibody was also prepared.	2012 Feb	Dong Fang,Fu Yongfeng,Li Xueping,Jiang Jianguo,Sun Jianhua,Cheng Xunjia	Parasitology research. 110(2) 931-7	apyrase	MDNMPADKDVSKLFPLTLIHINDLHARFDETNMKSNACTAKDQCIAGIARVYQKIQDLLKEYKSKNAIYLNAGDNFQGTLWYNLLRWQVTADFITKLKPTAMTLGNHEFDHTPKGLAPYLAELDKAGIPTLVANLVMNDDPDLKSSKIQKSIKVTVGGKTIGIIGVLYDKTHEIAQTGKVTLSNAVETVKREAAALKKDKVDIIVVLSHCSYDEDKKIAKEAGQDIDVIVGAHSHSFLYSKESNKPYDQKDKIEGPYPTIVESNNKRKIPIVQAKSFGKYVGRLTLYFDNEGEVKHWEGYPEFIDNKVKQDPKILEALIPWRKKVQEIGSTKVGETTIELDRDSCRDKECTLGVLYADAFADHYTNSSFRPFAIIQAGNFRNPIKVGKITNGDIIEAAPFGSTADLIRLKGDNLWAVAEHSLALDDENRTNCLQVSGLRIVIDPSKSVGSRVVKIDVMDNRNPKSEDLKPLDRNAEYFIALPSYLADGKDGFSAMKEATARWTGPLDSDVFKSYVEKIKKVDKLKLDRVIVCKAGSPCT	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag	E0D877	Hydrolase		8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21856428	Optimized refolding and characterization of S-peroxidase (CWPO_C of Populus alba) expressed in E. coli.	Cationic cell wall peroxidase (CWPO_C) from poplar tree (Populus alba L) was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli as an inclusion body. The insoluble inclusion body was solubilized and reactivated via a refolding procedure. The condition for this procedure was optimized by varying the refolding pH, and the concentrations of the oxidizing agent (GSSG), denaturing agent (GndCl), and hemin, respectively. The optimal conditions for refolding CWPO_C were 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.5, 0.6mM GSSG, 5 μM hemin, 0.6 M GndCl and 5 mM CaCl₂. The fact that the absorbance spectrum was identical to that of wild CWPO_C from poplar tree suggests that the protein folding, heme insertion and iron coordination were correctly archived. The binding affinity and turnover rate values of refolded CWPO_C were compared with those of HRP_C. k(cat)/K(m) for sinapyl alcohol of CWPO_C was over 170 times higher than that of HRP_C, on the while k(cat)/K(m) for coniferyl alcohol showed similar values for both peroxidase. The kinetic parameters showed that refolded CWPO_C possesses a very unique property of S-peroxidase, preferentially oxidizes sinapyl alcohol rather than coniferyl alcohol.

Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked alkaline phosphatase (GPI-ALP) from the epithelial membrane of the larval midgut of Aedes aegypti was previously identified as a functional receptor of the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry4Ba toxin. Here, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli of the cloned ALP, lacking the secretion signal and GPI attachment sequences, and assessment of its binding characteristics were further investigated. The 54-kDa His tag-fused ALP overexpressed as an inclusion body was soluble when phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) was supplemented with 8 M urea. After renaturation in a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity column, the refolded ALP protein was able to retain its phosphatase activity. This refolded ALP also showed binding to the 65-kDa activated Cry4Ba toxin under nondenaturing (dot blot) conditions. Quantitative binding analysis using a quartz crystal microbalance revealed that the purified ALP immobilized on a gold electrode was bound by the Cry4Ba toxin in a stoichiometry of approximately 1:2 and with high affinity (dissociation constant [K(d)] of ∼14 nM) which is comparable to that calculated from kinetic parameters (dissociation rate constant [k(off)]/binding constant [k(on)]). Altogether, the data presented here of the E. coli-expressed ALP from A. aegypti retaining high-affinity toxin binding support our notion that glycosylation of this receptor is not required for binding to its counterpart toxin, Cry4Ba.	2011 Sep	Thammasittirong Anon,Dechklar Manasave,Leetachewa Somphob,Pootanakit Kusol,Angsuthanasombat Chanan	Applied and environmental microbiology. 77(19) 6836-40	alkaline phosphatase	QGEYDPNYWNQQAHDLLFEKKDYTMQKVNIAKNIIVFVGSGMSQATVTAARTHKGGENATFPFEQLKWSGNARTYCVDSRVPDSACASTAFLTGVKSNLGTVAVHPNVKRGDCVATSDKVKQLESIAKWALAEGRVVGFATTSRVTAGSNAALYAHSADKDWENDASVTAAGCNATQVNDIAYQLINGDVGKHFKVIFGGGRKNFIPNTETDESGARGLRTDGKNLIQEWKESKTGNAVYITTNSELGALNTTNIDYLMGLFSYDRLPYAADMGEEPNKETPPLVRMVHYSLEMLQKKEHSGGFLLFVEDGNIQEAHKENKPIKAFEQVKHYANAFNMAHMMVSEANTLLISMNDVGSTLSIPGYPARDTDILTEAGTSDKDSKPYLSLAYATGPSYDSYYQPNEGRVNPLAVLQGTPTQKEQTCSAAVPMSEGVNGGEDASVYATGPWAFMFSGGYEQNFIAHAISFASCITDVCGGA	37-515 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	Q16EP7	phosphatase		7.5		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21871568	Prokaryotic expression, purification, and refolding of leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 and its effect on gene expression of head kidney-derived macrophages of a teleost fish, ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis).	Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) is reported to be an immunorelevant protein in ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis). In this study, ayu LECT2 mature peptide (aLECT2m) was expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The denatured recombinant aLECT2m (raLECT2m) was refolded by a size-exclusion chromatography refolding process achieved by using arginine-containing mobile phase and a decreasing urea gradient. The in vitro chemotactic activity assay showed that the refolded raLECT2m had the bioactivity. By using suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) method, we further identified up-regulated genes in ayu macrophages treated with refolded raLECT2m. These genes were tightly involved in endocytosis, hydrolysis, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, and so on. Moreover, real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results confirmed that selected 10 genes expression was significantly up-regulated in refolded raLECT2m-treated ayu macrophages. This study provides a basis for further studies of the mechanism of cytokine LECT2 in fish immune responses.	2011 Nov	Zhang R C,Chen J,Li C H,Lu X J,Shi Y H	Fish &amp; shellfish immunology. 31(6) 911-8	Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2	MKAAVYLFSLVLAELLLGGEAVTFGQFCSGNTNNRKRTSDKWGQGSYGASRGDRDHLGLDVVCQDGAVVYAPFDVKLNGKVVVYTDPKKAAINNGINLSGEGLCFKLFYVKPDKYSGEVKKGDRLGTMLPMQSVYPGITSHIHVQMCDKSDPTKYF	N-terminal His6 tag	D0R070		full length	7.5	4	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21884691	Heterologous expression, refolding and functional characterization of two antifreeze proteins from Fragilariopsis cylindrus (Bacillariophyceae).	Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) provide protection for organisms subjected to the presence of ice crystals. The psychrophilic diatom Fragilariopsis cylindrus which is frequently found in polar sea ice carries a multitude of AFP isoforms. In this study we report the heterologous expression of two antifreeze protein isoforms from F. cylindrus in Escherichia coli. Refolding from inclusion bodies produced proteins functionally active with respect to crystal deformation, recrystallization inhibition and thermal hysteresis. We observed a reduction of activity in the presence of the pelB leader peptide in comparison with the GS-linked SUMO-tag. Activity was positively correlated to protein concentration and buffer salinity. Thermal hysteresis and crystal deformation habit suggest the affiliation of the proteins to the hyperactive group of AFPs. One isoform, carrying a signal peptide for secretion, produced a thermal hysteresis up to 1.53°C±0.53°C and ice crystals of hexagonal bipyramidal shape. The second isoform, which has a long preceding N-terminal sequence of unknown function, produced thermal hysteresis of up to 2.34°C±0.25°C. Ice crystals grew in form of a hexagonal column in presence of this protein. The different sequences preceding the ice binding domain point to distinct localizations of the proteins inside or outside the cell. We thus propose that AFPs have different functions in vivo, also reflected in their specific TH capability.	2011 Nov	Uhlig Christiane,Kabisch Johannes,Palm Gottfried J,Valentin Klaus,Schweder Thomas,Krell Andreas	Cryobiology. 63(3) 220-8	Antifreeze protein	NKQKPQQQLLPSQSKSKSKSKMMNLNLFLISAAAMVSVASANNPSPPAVDLGTAEDFVILAKAGVTNVPGGYITGDIGVSPIAASAMTGFNLIMDSSNEFSTSTEASGSFYAPDYMSPTGTKLTTAVSDMLTAYNDAAARPVTGGPFDNSLSGETYTNLGAGEIGGLTLTPGVYTYDISVGITGSDVTFDGDGNEDSVFIIKTSKSVLQAAGTEVILQNGAKAENIFWSVAQEVNVGAGAHMKGILLVKTAVKFITGSSFEGRVLSATAVTLQEATHQQPTASSARRGLRGQVA					8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

21889551	Overexpression and purification of the recombinant diphtheria toxin variant CRM197 in Escherichia coli.	The expression of the recombinant diphtheria toxin mutant CRM197 in bacteria other than Corynebacterium diphtheriae has proven to be difficult. Here we propose a new and alternative procedure for the production of full-length CRM197 in Escherichia coli. The present study relates specifically to the expression of an artificial sequence and to a method for the isolation and purification of the corresponding protein. In particular, a synthetic gene coding for CRM197, bearing a short histidine tag and optimized for E. coli codon usage, was cloned in the pET9a vector. Accordingly, the over-expression of the protein was simply induced with arabinose in E. coli BL21AI. The recombinant protein was insoluble and always found inside protein aggregates, which were solubilised using urea. Surprisingly, the expression of CRM197, devoid of the short tag, always failed. Following a refolding step, the his-tagged CRM197 was purified by affinity and gel-filtration chromatography and the purity of the final preparation reached 95%. Interestingly, the recombinant protein features DNase activity, indicating that the presence of the tag is not affecting its biochemical properties. However, the removal of the synthetic tag could be easily obtained by incubating the target protein with a proper quantity of a commercial enterokinase.	2011 Nov	Stefan Alessandra,Conti Matteo,Rubboli Diego,Ravagli Lorenzo,Presta Enrica,Hochkoeppler Alejandro	Journal of biotechnology. 156(4) 245-52	CRM197	GADDVVDSSKSFVMENFSSYHGTKPGYVDSIQKGIQKPKSGTQGNYDDDWKEFYSTDNKYDAAGYSVDNENPLSGKAGGVVKVTYPGLTKVLALKVDNAETIKKELGLSLTEPLMEQVGTEEFIKRFGDGASRVVLSLPFAEGSSSVEYINNWEQAKALSVELEINFETRGKRGQDAMYEYMAQACAGNRVRRSVGSSLSCINLDWDVIRDKTKTKIESLKEHGPIKNKMSESPNKTVSEEKAKQYLEEFHQTALEHPELSELKTVTGTNPVFAGANYAAWAVNVAQVIDSETADNLEKTTAALSILPGIGSVMGIADGAVHHNTEEIVAQSIALSSLMVAQAIPLVGELVDIGFAAYNFVESIINLFQVVHNSYNRPAYSPGHKTQPFLHDGYAVSWNTVEDSIIRTGFQGESGHDIKITAENTPLPIAGVLLPTIPGKLDVNKSKTHISVNGRKIRMRCRAIDGDVTFCRPKSPVYVGNGVHANLHVAFHRSSSEKIHSNEISSDSIGVLGYQKTVDHTKVNSKLSLFFEIKS	without signal peptide, G84E mutant, N-terminal His6 tag	P00588	Glycosyltransferase, Toxin, Transferase		8		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21892195	Preparation and immunogenicity of tag-free recombinant human eppin.	Human epididymal protease inhibitor (eppin) may be effective as a male contraceptive vaccine. In a number of studies, eppin with an engineered His(6)-tag has been produced using prokaryotic expression systems. For production of pharmaceutical-grade proteins for human use, however, the His(6)-tag must be removed. This study describes a method for producing recombinant human eppin without a His(6)-tag. We constructed plasmid pET28a (+)-His(6)-tobacco etch virus (TEV)-eppin for expression in Escherichia coli. After purification and refolding, the fusion protein His(6)-TEV-eppin was digested with TEV protease to remove the His(6)-tag and was further purified by NTA-Ni(2+) affinity chromatography. Using this procedure, 2 mg of eppin without a His(6)-tag was isolated from 1 l of culture with a purity of &gt;95%. The immunogenicity of the eppin was characterized using male Balb/c mice.	2011 Nov	Zhang Jie,Ding Xin-Liang,Bian Zeng-Hui,Xia Yan-Kai,Wang Shou-Lin,Song Ling,Wang Xin-Ru	Asian journal of andrology. 13(6) 889-94	eppin	PGLTDWLFPRRCPKIREECEFQERDVCTKDRQCQDNKKCCVFSCGKKCLDLKQDVCEMPKETGPCLAYFLHWWYDKKDNTCSMFVYGGCQGNNNNFQSKANCLNTCKNKRFP	N-terminal His6 tag, without signal peptide	O95925	Antimicrobial, Protease inhibitor, Serine protease inhibitor		8.0		t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
21900158	Crystal structure of swine major histocompatibility complex class I SLA-1 0401 and identification of 2009 pandemic swine-origin influenza A H1N1 virus cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope peptides.	The presentation of viral epitopes to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by swine leukocyte antigen class I (SLA I) is crucial for swine immunity. To illustrate the structural basis of swine CTL epitope presentation, the first SLA crystal structures, SLA-1 0401, complexed with peptides derived from either 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) swine-origin influenza A virus (S-OIV(NW9); NSDTVGWSW) or Ebola virus (Ebola(AY9); ATAAATEAY) were determined in this study. The overall peptide-SLA-1 0401 structures resemble, as expected, the general conformations of other structure-solved peptide major histocompatibility complexes (pMHC). The major distinction of SLA-1 0401 is that Arg(156) has a &quot;one-ballot veto&quot; function in peptide binding, due to its flexible side chain. S-OIV(NW9) and Ebola(AY9) bind SLA-1 0401 with similar conformations but employ different water molecules to stabilize their binding. The side chain of P7 residues in both peptides is exposed, indicating that the epitopes are &quot;featured&quot; peptides presented by this SLA. Further analyses showed that SLA-1 0401 and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I HLA-A 0101 can present the same peptides, but in different conformations, demonstrating cross-species epitope presentation. CTL epitope peptides derived from 2009 pandemic S-OIV were screened and evaluated by the in vitro refolding method. Three peptides were identified as potential cross-species influenza virus (IV) CTL epitopes. The binding motif of SLA-1 0401 was proposed, and thermostabilities of key peptide-SLA-1 0401 complexes were analyzed by circular dichroism spectra. Our results not only provide the structural basis of peptide presentation by SLA I but also identify some IV CTL epitope peptides. These results will benefit both vaccine development and swine organ-based xenotransplantation.	2011 Oct	Zhang Nianzhi,Qi Jianxun,Feng Sijia,Gao Feng,Liu Jun,Pan Xiaocheng,Chen Rong,Li Qirun,Chen Zhaosan,Li Xiaoying,Xia Chun,Gao George F	Journal of virology. 85(22) 11709-24	SLA-1*0401	GPHSLSYFYTAVSRPDRGDSRFIAVGYVDDTQFVRFDNYAPNPRMEPRVPWIQQEGQEYWDRETRNVKETAQTYGVGLNTLRGYYNQSEAGSHTLQSMYGCYLGPDGLLLHGYRQDAYDGADYIALNEDLRSWTAADMAAQITKRKWEAADEAERRRSYLQGLCVESLRRYLEMGKDTLQRAEPPKTHVTRHPSSDLGVTLRCWALGFYPKEISLTWQREGQDQSQDMELVETRPSGDGTFQKWAALVVPPGEEQSYTCHVQHEGLQEPLTLRWD	22-296 aa	O19244	peptide antigen binding		8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	t

21907285	Characterization and identification of the protein partners of Fn3 domain in FnTm2.	Recently, a novel transmembrane protein was found to be up-regulated in the auditory learning pathway of birds and mammals. The protein, FnTm2, was predicted to have an extracellular fibronectin III (Fn3) domain and a single transmembrane domain. By contrast to other studied Fn3 domains the extracellular domain of FnTm2 bears several cysteine residues, which are predicted to form disulfide bonds. The Fn3 domain of the FnTm2 protein was expressed in DH5-α Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells, purified and characterized by circular dichroism (CD). In order to identify binding partners to Fn3, the isolated protein was incubated with bird brain lysate for a pull down treatment. Of the proteins recognized, myelin basic protein (MBP) was identified as a bona fide partner; it was further characterized for binding to Fn3 in vitro via fluorescence spectroscopy and confirmed via isothermal calorimetry (ITC).	2011 Nov	Baker Peter James,Chan Yan Mei,Hertel Moritz,Montclare Jin Kim	Protein expression and purification. 81(1) 42-8	FnTm2	MNIEVHNITYTSATVSWAMSSPCPENYYHVMYRPNWNSVFAGYLRQNFRREERVPHPLSSLVLHRLTPSTIYVLCTTCKNSYPSSNHCTTFHTLDKIPLVFGGSKHEPTTSMWMVSSLLLLCFLALLAYGCLQFWSARCHWAARLKHPNSSPEEVGEGSGSPEEPLSDGLREELLEVPMTTVLMRSSSFVKESPYNSPHCFFSYKNSDDKRAILPQHGLQ	C-terminal His8 tag	A0N0G5		full length	4.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
21907286	Recombinant expression, purification and dimerization of the neurotrophic growth factor Artemin for in vitro and in vivo use.	Artemin (ARTN) is a neurotrophic growth factor of the GDNF ligand family that signals through the specific GFRα-3 coreceptor/cRet tyrosine kinase-mediated signaling cascade. Its expression and signaling action in adults are restricted to nociceptive sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia. Consequently, Artemin supports survival and growth of sensory neurons and has been studied as a possible treatment for neuropathic pain paradigms. In this paper, we describe the development of an efficient method for the recombinant bacterial production of large quantities of highly pure, biologically active ARTN for in vitro and in vivo studies. Using Escherichia coli expression of an NH(2)-terminal SUMO-Artemin fusion protein and subsequent refolding from inclusion bodies followed by cleavage of the SUMO fusion part, mature Artemin with a native NH(2)-terminal amino acid sequence was obtained at high purity (&gt;99%). Experiments using the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) demonstrated that the intermolecular disulphide bridge in the cysteine knot is dispensable for dimerization of stable ARTN monomers. Our production method could facilitate in vitro and in vivo experimentation for the possible development of Artemin as a therapeutic agent for neuropathic pain.	2011 Nov	Bruinzeel Wouter,Masure Stefan	Protein expression and purification. 81(1) 25-32	Artemin	AGGPGSRARAAGARGCRLRSQLVPVRALGLGHRSDELVRFRFCSGSCRRARSPHDLSLASLLGAGALRPPPGSRPVSQPCCRPTRYEAVSFMDVNSTWRTVDRLSATACGCLG	without signal peptide and propeptide, N-terminal His6 and SUMO tag	Q5T4W7	Growth factor		8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
21964443	Solubilization of inclusion body proteins using n-propanol and its refolding into bioactive form.	Inclusion bodies of recombinant human growth hormone (r-hGH) were isolated from Escherichia coli, enriched and solubilized in 100mM Tris buffer containing 6M n-propanol and 2M urea. Around 4 mg/ml of r-hGH from inclusion bodies were solubilized in 6M n-propanol-based buffer containing 2M urea. Existence of native-like secondary structure of r-hGH in 6M n-propanol solution was confirmed by CD and fluorescence spectra. Solubilized r-hGH was subsequently refolded by pulsatile dilution, purified to homogeneity and found to be functionally active. Tris buffer containing 6M n-propanol and 2M urea also effectively solubilized a number of proteins expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli. Mild solubilization of inclusion body proteins, chaotropic effect of n-propanol at high concentration and kosmotropic effect at lower concentration helped in improved refolding of the solubilized protein. Around 400f the r-hGH in the form of inclusion body aggregates was refolded into bioactive form while using n-propanol as solubilization agent. Solubilization with 6M n-propanol solution thus can be a viable alternative for achieving high throughput recovery of bioactive protein from inclusion bodies of E. coli.	2011 Nov	Singh Surinder M,Sharma Aparna,Upadhyay Arun K,Singh Anupam,Garg Lalit C,Panda Amulya K	Protein expression and purification. 81(1) 75-82	human growth hormone	FPTIPLSRLFDNAMLRAHRLHQLAFDTYQEFEEAYIPKEQKYSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNREETQQKSNLELLRISLLLIQSWLEPVQFLRSVFANSLVYGASDSNVYDLLKDLEEGIQTLMGRLEDGSPRTGQIFKQTYSKFDTNSHNDDALLKNYGLLYCFRKDMDKVETFLRIVQCRSVEGSCGF	without signal peptide	P01241	Hormone		8.5		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
22002161	Effects of L-arginine on refolding of lysine-tagged human insulin-like growth factor 1 expressed in Escherichia coli.	Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a therapeutic protein, is highly homologous to proinsulin in 3-dimensional structure. To highly express IGF1 in recombinant Escherichia coli, IGF1 was engineered to be fused with the 6-lysine tag and ubiquitin at its N-terminus (K6Ub-IGF1). Fed-batch fermentation of E. coli TG1/pAPT-K6Ub-IGF1 resulted in 60.8 g/L of dry cell mass, 180f which was inclusion bodies composed of K6Ub-IGF1. Subsequent refolding processes were conducted using accumulated inclusion bodies. An environment of 50 mM bicine buffer (pH 8.5), 125 mM L-arginine, and 4 °C was chosen to optimize the refolding of K6Ub-IGF1, and 240 mg/L of denatured K6Ub-IGF1 was refolded with a 32% yield. The positive effect of L-arginine on K6Ub-IGF1 refolding might be ascribed to preventing unfolded K6Ub-IGF1 from undergoing self-aggregation and thus increasing its solubility. The simple dilution refolding, followed by cleavage of the fusion protein by site-specific UBP1 and chromatographic purification of IGF1, led production of authentic IGF1 with 971fb7850urity and an 8.51fb7850urification yield, starting from 500 mg of inclusion bodies composed of K6Ub-IGF1, as verified by various analytical tools, such as RP-HPLC, CD spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and Western blotting. Thus, it was confirmed that L-arginine with an aggregation-protecting ability could be applied to the development of refolding processes for other inclusion body-derived proteins.	2012 Jan	Choi Seung Phill,Park Yong-Cheol,Lee JungHwa,Sim Sang Jun,Chang Ho-Nam	Bioprocess and biosystems engineering. 35(1-2) 255-63	Insulin-like growth factor 1	GP ETLCGAELVD ALQFVCGDRG FYFNKPTGYG SSSRRAPQTG IVDECCFRSC DLRRLEMYCA PLKPAKSA	N-terminal Lys6 tag and ubiquitin fused protein, 49-118 aa	P05019	Growth factor		8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
22099451	Identification of Tyr74 and Tyr177 as substrate oxidation sites in cationic cell wall-bound peroxidase from Populus alba L.	Cationic cell wall-bound peroxidase (CWPO-C) has the capability to oxidize sinapyl alcohol, ferrocytochrome c, and synthetic lignin polymers, unlike most peroxidases that have been characterized in flowering plants, such as horseradish peroxidase and Arabidopsis thaliana peroxidase A2. It has been suggested that the oxidation site is located on the CWPO-C surface, and homology modeling and chemically modified CWPO-C studies suggest that Tyr74 and/or Tyr177 are possible participants in the catalytic site. The present study clarifies the importance of these Tyr residues for substrate oxidation, using recombinant CWPO-C and recombinant mutant CWPO-C with phenylalanine substitution(s) for tyrosine. Such recombinant proteins, produced in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, were successfully refolded to yield the active form, and purified recombinant protein solutions exhibited typical spectra of high-spin ferric protein and displayed H(2) O(2) -dependent oxidation of guaiacol, 2,6-dimethoxyphenol, and syringaldazine. Measurement of peroxidase activity with these guaiacyl and syringyl compounds as reducing substrates indicated that a single mutation, Y74F or Y177F, resulted in substantial loss of oxidation activity (∼ 40-60% and 82%, respectively). Also, over 950f the oxidation activity was lost with a double mutation, Y74F/Y177F. These results indicated that Tyr74 and Tyr177, rather than the heme pocket, play a central role in the oxidation of these substrates. This is the first report of active residues on an enzyme surface being identified in a plant peroxidase. This study also suggests that sinapyl alcohol incorporation into lignin is performed by a peroxidase that generates Tyr radicals on its surface.	2012 Jan	Shigeto Jun,Itoh Yoshitaka,Tsutsumi Yuji,Kondo Ryuichiro	The FEBS journal. 279(2) 348-57	Cationic cell wall-bound peroxidase	QGTRVGFYATTCRRAESIVRATVQSHFTSDSSIAPGLLRMHFHDCFVNGCDASILIDGANTEKTAGPNLLLRGYDVIADAKTQLEAECPGVVSCADILALAARDSVVLTKGLTWPVPTGRRDGRVSLASDTSNLPGFTDSVDVQKQKFAAFGLNAQDLVTLVGGHTIGTTACQFFRYRLYNFTTTGNGADPSINPSFVSQLQTLCPQNGDGSRRIALDTGSQNSFDSSFFANLRSGQGILESDQKLWTDATTRTFVQRFLGVRGLAGLTFGVEFGRSMVKMSNIGVKTGTTGEIRRVCSAIN	without signal peptide	Q4ADU9	heme and metal ion binding, peroxidase		9.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

22112400	Increasing the refolding efficiency in vitro by site-directed mutagenesis of Cys383 in rat procarboxypeptidase B.	This study examines a novel method to reduce the probability of disulfide mismatches during the refolding process by the replacement of cysteines within a protein. Specifically, Cys383 of recombinant rat procarboxypeptidase B was replaced by other amino acids to increase the refolding efficiency in vitro. Mutants C383G, C383A and C383S could refold successfully, but mutants C383R, C383E, C383L and C383Y failed to refold correctly. Compared with wild type, the refolding efficiencies of mutants C383G and C383A were enhanced. The Cys383 mutations changed some of the properties of rat carboxypeptidase B. Mutants C383G, C383A had higher k(cat)/K(m) values which indicated increased catalytic abilities. And both had higher thermal stability. pH had different effects on the activities and stabilities of the mutant and wild type proteins. The studies suggested that mutating Cys383 of rat procarboxypeptidase B could improve the renaturation process by increasing the refolding efficiency. This new method could be taken as a new attempt to improve the refolding efficiency of other recombinant proteins containing disulfide bonds that are expressed as inclusion bodies.

Compared with wild type, the refolding efficiencies of mutants C383G and C383A were enhanced. The Cys383 mutations changed some of the properties of rat carboxypeptidase B. Mutants C383G, C383A had higher k(cat)/K(m) values which indicated increased catalytic abilities. And both had higher thermal stability. pH had different effects on the activities and stabilities of the mutant and wild type proteins. The studies suggested that mutating Cys383 of rat procarboxypeptidase B could improve the renaturation process by increasing the refolding efficiency. This new method could be taken as a new attempt to improve the refolding efficiency of other recombinant proteins containing disulfide bonds that are expressed as inclusion bodies. While the results also claimed that the potential effects of the substituted amino acid on the protein itself should be seriously considered in addition to its ability to reduce the probability of disulfide mismatches.	2011 Nov	Li Suxia,Zhang Luosheng,Wu Qian,Xin Aijie,Zhao Jian,Fan Liqiang	Enzyme and microbial technology. 49(2) 139-45	procarboxypeptidase B	HASEEHFDGNRVYRVSVHGEDHVNLIQELANTKEIDFWKPDSATQVKPLTTVDFHVKAEDVADVENFLEENEVHYEVLISNVRNALESQFDSHTRASGHSYTKYNKWETIEAWIQQVATDNPDLVTQSVIGTTFEGRNMYVLKIGKTRPNKPAIFIDCGFHAREWISPAFCQWFVREAVRTYNQEIHMKQLLDELDFYVLPVVNIDGYVYTWTKDRMWRKTRSTMAGSSCLGVRPNRNFNAGWCEVGASRSPCSETYCGPAPESEKETKALADFIRNNLSTIKAYLTIHSYSQMMLYPYSYDYKLPENYEELNALVKGAAKELATLHGTKYTYGPGATTIYPAAGGSDDWSYDQGIKYSFTFELRDTGFFGFLLPESQIRQTGEETMLAVKYIANYVREHLY	N-terminal His6 tag, without signal peptide, C396G mutant	P19223	Carboxypeptidase, Hydrolase, Metalloprotease, Protease		9.5		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

22119775	Optimized refolding and characterization of active C-terminal ADAMTS-18 fragment from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli.	The human ADAMTS-18 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type-1 modules 18) is a new member of the ADAMTS family. The C-terminal ADAMTS-18 fragment is highly effective at promoting platelet thrombus dissolution in murine model of ischemic stroke, showing significant clinical relevance. In this report, the C-terminal ADAMTS-18 fragment with a GST tag (named rADAMTS-351) was overexpressed mainly as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS. The insoluble inclusion body was solubilized and reactivated via a refolding procedure. The optimal buffers for refolding rADAMTS-351 was composed of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer at pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT, 1 mM GSH, and 0.2 mM GSSG. The refolded rADAMTS-351 was dialyzed and further purified by glutathione-agarose beads. The purity of the final product reached 98% as evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining. The recombinant protein displayed its immunoreactivity with anti-C-terminal ADAMTS-18 antibodies by Western blotting. Mass spectroscopic analysis indicated a molecular mass of 65,327 Da as theoretically expected. Purified rADAMTS-351 displayed its bioactivity by inducing platelet fragmentation, which ranged from 81-96compared to active C-terminal ADAMTS-18 standards. The expression and refolding strategy described in this study allows convenient small-scale production of rADAMTS-351 with biological function and therapeutic potential.	2012 Feb	Dang Suying,Hong Tao,Bu Dawei,Tang Jian,Fan Jing,Zhang Wei	Protein expression and purification. 82(1) 32-6	a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type-1 modules 18 (ADAMTS-18)	A TKRPAYTWSI VQSECSVSCG GGYINVKAIC LRDQNTQVNS SFCSAKTKPV TEPKICNAFS CPAYWMPGEW STCSKACAGG QQSRKIQCVQ KKPFQKEEAV LHSLCPVSTP TQVQACNSHA CPPQWSLGPW SQCSKTCGRG VRKRELLCKG SAAETLPESQ CTSLPRPELQ EGCVLGRCPK NSRLQWVASS WSECSATCGL GVRKREMKCS EKGFQGKLIT FPERRCRNIK KPNLDLEETC NRRACPAHPV YNMVAGWYSL PWQQCTVTCG GGVQTRSVHC VQQGRPSSSC LLHQKPPVLR ACNTNFCPAP EKREDPSCVD FFNWCHLVPQ HGVCNHKFYG KQCCKSCTRK I	870-1221 aa, N-terminal GST tag	Q8TE60	Hydrolase, Metalloprotease, Protease	C-terminal fragment	8.0	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22202650	Cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of a glutamate-specific endopeptidase from Bacillus licheniformis.	A gene encoding a glutamate-specific endopeptidase (GSE) from Bacillus licheniformis (BL) has been cloned in Escherichia coli cells. The recombinant protein was expressed as cytoplasmic insoluble inclusion bodies. Immobilized metal affinity chromatography was employed to purify the protein, and then a 27-kDa GSE intermediate was obtained by gradient urea dialysis. The remaining pro-peptide was completely removed by treatment with trypsin to obtain mature GSE-BL with a molecular weight of 26 kD at a final yield of up to 140.9 mg/L. With Z (benzyloxycarbomyl)-Phe-Leu-Glu-pNA (p-nitroanilide) as the substrate, the optimal temperature and pH conditions for the enzyme were 37 °C and 8.5, respectively, K(m) was 1.495 ± 0.034 mM, and V(max) was 50.237 μmol/mg min. The presence of calcium and ferrous ions enhanced the catalytic activity of GSE-BL. These results suggest that the recombinant protein is a relatively stable specific proteinase that could be effectively utilized in protein structure analysis, peptide synthesis, and the food industry.	2012 Feb	Ye Wei,Liu Jingwen,Wang Haiying,Wang Jufang,Wang Xiaoning	Protein expression and purification. 82(1) 138-43	glutamate-specific endopeptidase	MHPAQA APSPHTPVSS DPSYKAETSV TYDPNIKSDQ YGLYSKAFTG TGKVNETKEK AEKKSPAKAP YSIKSVIGSD DRTRVTNTTA YPYRAIVHIS SSIGSCTGWM IGPKTVATAG HCIYDTSSGS FAGTATVSPG RNGTSYPYGS VKSTRYFIPS GWRSGNTNYD YGAIELSEPI GNTVGYFGYS YTTSSLVGTT VTISGYPGDK TAGTQWQHSG PIAISETYKL QYAMDTYGGQ SGSPVFEQSS SRTNCSGPCS LAVHTNGVYG GSSYNRGTRI TKEVFDNLTN WKNSAQ	C-terminal His6 tag, 25-316 aa	P80057	Hydrolase, Protease, Serine protease		8.5	10	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22209547	High productivity chromatography refolding process for Hepatitis B Virus X (HBx) protein guided by statistical design of experiment studies.	The Hepatitis B Virus X (HBx) protein is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, consistent expression of the protein as insoluble inclusion bodies in bacteria host systems has largely hindered HBx manufacturing via economical biosynthesis routes, thereby impeding the development of anti-HBx therapeutic strategies. To eliminate this roadblock, this work reports the development of the first &#39;chromatography refolding&#39;-based bioprocess for HBx using immobilised metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). This process enabled production of HBx at quantities and purity that facilitate their direct use in structural and molecular characterization studies. In line with the principles of quality by design (QbD), we used a statistical design of experiments (DoE) methodology to design the optimum process which delivered bioactive HBx at a productivity of 0.21 mg/ml/h at a refolding yield of 54% (at 10 mg/ml refolding concentration), which was 4.4-fold higher than that achieved in dilution refolding. The systematic DoE methodology adopted for this study enabled us to obtain important insights into the effect of different bioprocess parameters like the effect of buffer exchange gradients on HBx productivity and quality. Such a bioprocess design approach can play a pivotal role in developing intensified processes for other novel proteins, and hence helping to resolve validation and speed-to-market challenges faced by the biopharmaceutical industry today.	2012 Jan	Basu Anindya,Leong Susanna Su Jan	Journal of chromatography.

22212394	High pH solubilization and chromatography-based renaturation and purification of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor from inclusion bodies.	Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) is a very efficient therapeutic protein drug which has been widely used in human clinics to treat cancer patients suffering from chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. In this study, rhG-CSF was solubilized from inclusion bodies by using a high-pH solution containing low concentration of urea. It was found that solubilization of the rhG-CSF inclusion bodies greatly depended on the buffer pH employed; alkalic pH significantly favored the solubilization. In addition, when small amount of urea was added to the solution at high pH, the solubilization was further enhanced. After solubilization, the rhG-CSF was renatured with simultaneous purification by using weak anion exchange, strong anion exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography, separately. The results indicated that the rhG-CSF solubilized by the high-pH solution containing low concentration of urea had much higher mass recovery than the one solubilized by 8 M urea when using anyone of the three refolding methods employed in this work. In the case of weak anion exchange chromatography, the high pH solubilized rhG-CSF could get a mass recovery of 73%. The strategy of combining solubilization of inclusion bodies at high pH with refolding of protein using liquid chromatography may become a routine method for protein production from inclusion bodies.	2012 Feb	Li Ming,Fan Hua,Liu Jiahua,Wang Minhong,Wang Lili,Wang Chaozhan	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 166(5) 1264-74	Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor	ATPLGPASSLPQSFLLKCLEQVRKIQGDGAALQEKLVSECATYKLCHPEELVLLGHSLGIPWAPLSSCPSQALQLAGCLSQLHSGLFLYQGLLQALEGISPELGPTLDTLQLDVADFATTIWQQMEELGMAPALQPTQGAMPAFASAFQRRAGGVLVASHLQSFLEVSYRVLRHLAQP	without signal peptide	P09919	cytokine		8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

22266086	Expression and purification of recombinant human Mig in Escherichia coli and its comparison with murine Mig.	Monokine induced by IFN-γ (Mig) is a member of CXC-chemokines and recruits T-lymphocytes to activate the immune response. In recent years, it has raised much interest in the areas of autoimmune disease and allograft rejection, as the production of recombinant human Mig (rHuMig) would be of considerable significance for both research and potential clinical use. Here we report the expression, preparation and characterization of non-tagged recombinant human Mig (rHuMig) using a prokaryotic expression system. Following expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21, the 103 amino acid residue of rHuMig was purified from bacteria inclusion bodies with a one-step S-Sepharose cation exchange chromatography. The product was immunologically characterized via Western blot and its purity was determined via SDS-PAGE and silver staining to be above 99%, with an endotoxin level &lt;0.5EU/μg via a chemotaxis assay, rHuMig demonstrated chemotactic activity on mouse spleen lymphocytes with an ED50 of 15 ng/mL. Additionally, using a proliferation assay, rHuMig significantly inhibited proliferation of the human bladder cell line T24. In vivo experiments revealed that rHuMig could inhibit mouse bone marrow mononuclear cells cycling into the S-phase and reduced intestinal cell proliferation. Our results demonstrate that rHuMig is fully functional in the mouse model.	2012 Feb	Qian Lan,Zhu Shunying,Shen Jiaqing,Han Xiaodong,Gao Jin,Wu Mingyuan,Yu Yan,Lu Huili,Han Wei	Protein expression and purification. 82(1) 205-11	Monokine induced by IFN-gamma (Mig)	TPVVRKGRCSCISTNQGTIHLQSLKDLKQFAPSPSCEKIEIIATLKNGVQTCLNPDSADVKELIKKWEKQVSQKKKQKNGKKHQKKKVLKVRKSQRSRQKKTT	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 tag	Q07325	chemokine		6.0	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22298007	Refolding, purification and crystallization of the FrpB outer membrane iron transporter from Neisseria meningitidis.	FrpB is an integral outer membrane protein from the human pathogen Neisseria meningitidis. It is a member of the TonB-dependent transporter family and promotes the uptake of iron across the outer membrane. There is also evidence that FrpB is an antigen and hence a potential component of a vaccine against meningococcal meningitis. FrpB incorporating a polyhistidine tag was overexpressed in Escherichia coli into inclusion bodies. The protein was then solubilized in urea, refolded and purified to homogeneity. Two separate antigenic variants of FrpB were crystallized by sitting-drop vapour diffusion. Crystals of the F5-1 variant diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution and belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 176.5, b = 79.4, c = 75.9 Å, β = 98.3°. Crystal-packing calculations suggested the presence of a monomer in the asymmetric unit. Crystals of the F3-3 variant also diffracted to 2.4 Å resolution and belonged to space group P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 85.3, b = 104.6, c = 269.1 Å.

22306742	A novel protein refolding protocol for the solubilization and purification of recombinant peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein from Xylella fastidiosa overexpressed in Escherichia coli.	Xylella fastidiosa is a Gram-negative xylem-limited plant pathogenic bacterium responsible for several economically important crop diseases. Here, we present a novel and efficient protein refolding protocol for the solubilization and purification of recombinant X. fastidiosa peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (XfPal). Pal is an outer membrane protein that plays important roles in maintaining the integrity of the cell envelope and in bacterial pathogenicity. Because Pal has a highly hydrophobic N-terminal domain, the heterologous expression studies necessary for structural and functional protein characterization are laborious once the recombinant protein is present in inclusion bodies. Our protocol based on the denaturation of the XfPal-enriched inclusion bodies with 8M urea followed by buffer-exchange steps via dialysis proved effective for the solubilization and subsequent purification of XfPal, allowing us to obtain a large amount of relatively pure and folded protein. In addition, XfPal was biochemically and functionally characterized. The method for purification reported herein is valuable for further research on the three-dimensional structure and function of Pal and other outer membrane proteins and can contribute to a better understanding of the role of these proteins in bacterial pathogenicity, especially with regard to the plant pathogen X. fastidiosa.	2012 Apr	Santos Clelton A,Beloti Lilian L,Toledo Marcelo A S,Crucello Aline,Favaro Marianna T P,Mendes Juliano S,Santiago André S,Azzoni Adriano R,Souza Anete P	Protein expression and purification. 82(2) 284-9	peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein	MAPTVST PAPTTTAPTD SSGLYTAADL DTDACLRQRV VYFDFDKDDV KKEFQTVLGC HAKYLRNRPS AHITLQGNTD ERGSREYNIA LGERRGNSVL YSLQANGASS GQLNVVSYGE ERPVCTESTE SCWSRNRRVE IVYTAK	44-186 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	Q9PC85			8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
22323388	Expression of a cGMP compatible Lucilia sericata insect serine proteinase debridement enzyme.	Previously, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a research grade recombinant chymotrypsin, derived from the larvae of Lucilia sericata, in &quot;debriding&quot; slough/eschar from venous leg ulcers ex vivo. Furthermore, we were able to formulate this enzyme for successful delivery to in vitro wound healing assays, from a prototype hydrogel wound dressing, and showed that enzyme delivered in this way could degrade wound tissue ex vivo. Recently, to progress biotechnological development of the enzyme as a potential therapeutic product, we explored expression using current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) guidelines, and now report that a recombinant chymotrypsin I zymogen from L. sericata can be expressed in the cGMP acceptable strain of Escherichia coli (BLR-DE3). In addition, the conditions required for purification, refolding and activation of the chymotrypsinogen have been determined. The activated enzyme was stable, and effective in digesting wound slough/eschar tissue. To summarise, we have successfully initiated the production and characterisation of a novel cGMP compatible product for use in future clinical trials.	2012 Apr	Pritchard David I,Telford Gary,Diab Miliza,Low Walter	Biotechnology progress. 28(2) 567-72	chymotrypsinogen I	FEGRITNGQDAVMGQFPYQVGLSLNLGNFKSAWCGGSLIGNEWVLTAAHCTDGVKSVTVFLGATYRTEAEVKYTVKPNDILIHPGWNNKTLKNDISLVKIPETAYTALIQPVELPALASSYPSFAGDEVIASGWGRISDSASGVTNYLQWARLEVISNAVCARTYGSTITSSNLCVKTPGGVSTCKGDSGGPLVLASSGVQVGLTSFGSILGCEKGFPAAFTRVTSYLEWINEHTGISY	without signal peptide, N-terminal His6 and S tag	Q25227	Hydrolase, Protease, Serine protease		9.5	6	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22343065	Recombinant expression, purification, and characterization of scorpion toxin BmαTX14.	Long-chain and cysteine-rich scorpion toxins exhibit various pharmacological profiles for different voltage-gated sodium channel subtypes. However, the exploration of toxin structure-function relationships has progressed slowly due to the difficulty of obtaining synthetic or recombinant peptides. We now report that we have established an effective expression and purification approach for the novel scorpion toxin BmαTX14. BmαTX14 was over-expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The insoluble pellet was successfully transformed into active peptide by using a refolding procedure. One-step purification by reverse-phase HPLC was sufficient to generate chromatographically pure peptide. The yield of recombinant toxin reached 4mg from 1L LB medium. The pharmacological data further showed that BmαTX14 selectively inhibited the fast inactivation of mNa(v)1.4 (EC(50)=82.3±15.7nM) rather than that of rNa(v)1.2 (EC(50)&gt;30μM), which indicates that BmαTX14 is a new α-like toxin. This work enables further structural, functional, and pharmacological studies of BmαTX14 and similar toxins.	2012 Apr	Dai Hui,Yin Shijin,Li Tian,Cao Zhijian,Ji Yonghua,Wu Yingliang,Li Wenxin	Protein expression and purification. 82(2) 325-31	BmalphaTX14	VRDAYIAKPENCVYHCATNEGCNKLCTDNGAESGYCQWGGKYGNACWCIKLPDDVPIRVPGKCH	20-83 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	Q9N682	Ion channel impairing toxin, Neurotoxin, Toxin, Voltage-gated sodium channel impairing toxin		7.0	16	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22363541	Identification and characterization of a novel calcium-activated apyrase from Cryptosporidium parasites and its potential role in pathogenesis.	Herein, we report the biochemical and functional characterization of a novel Ca(2+)-activated nucleoside diphosphatase (apyrase), CApy, of the intracellular gut pathogen Cryptosporidium. The purified recombinant CApy protein displayed activity, substrate specificity and calcium dependency strikingly similar to the previously described human apyrase, SCAN-1 (soluble calcium-activated nucleotidase 1). CApy was found to be expressed in both Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts and sporozoites, and displayed a polar localization in the latter, suggesting a possible co-localization with the apical complex of the parasite. In vitro binding experiments revealed that CApy interacts with the host cell in a dose-dependent fashion, implying the presence of an interacting partner on the surface of the host cell. Antibodies directed against CApy block Cryptosporidium parvum sporozoite invasion of HCT-8 cells, suggesting that CApy may play an active role during the early stages of parasite invasion. Sequence analyses revealed that the capy gene shares a high degree of homology with apyrases identified in other organisms, including parasites, insects and humans. Phylogenetic analysis argues that the capy gene is most likely an ancestral feature that has been lost from most apicomplexan genomes except Cryptosporidium, Neospora and Toxoplasma.	2012 Feb	Manque Patricio A,Woehlbier Ute,Lara Ana M,Tenjo Fernando,Alves João M,Buck Gregory A	PloS one. 7(2) e31030	Apyrase	IQERRVC TDEMPCNFRL VADLDMKSKP GSGEKNYKSL FQKGSIIQDK RGNYRVYWGE SLELKSGYNE YGRGMELSEL ISYNGMMLAG DDRTGIIFEI TDDGKGVAPR YILSEGNGRT AKGMKIEWFA VRDGILWVGS FGKEFVSNGI IEKRDNMWVA TIDKRGYVSR FNWSFVYEKI RNSLGAQYPG YCIHEAVIWS HLMRKWIFLP RRVSFDEYDE EKDEKRGSNK MIIMTDDFEI LEIIDVGLII PERGFSSLKF LPGSFDQIIV ATKSVEESIS DTQKSFLTIF TINGKILMED LEVPGDYKYE GIEFI	34-345 aa, N-terminal Hi6 and S tag	A0A0S4TGJ7	pyrophosphatase		8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22369502	Marburg virus glycoprotein GP2: pH-dependent stability of the ectodomain α-helical bundle.	Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV) constitute the family Filoviridae of enveloped viruses (filoviruses) that cause severe hemorrhagic fever. Infection by MARV requires fusion between the host cell and viral membranes, a process that is mediated by the two subunits of the envelope glycoprotein, GP1 (surface subunit) and GP2 (transmembrane subunit). Upon viral attachment and uptake, it is believed that the MARV viral fusion machinery is triggered by host factors and environmental conditions found in the endosome. Next, conformational rearrangements in the GP2 ectodomain result in the formation of a highly stable six-helix bundle; this refolding event provides the energetic driving force for membrane fusion. Both GP1 and GP2 from EBOV have been extensively studied, but there is little information available for the MARV glycoproteins. Here we have expressed two variants of the MARV GP2 ectodomain in Escherichia coli and analyzed their biophysical properties. Circular dichroism indicates that the MARV GP2 ectodomain adopts an α-helical conformation, and one variant sediments as a trimer by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. Denaturation studies indicate the α-helical structure is highly stable at pH 5.3 (unfolding energy, ΔG(unf,H(2)O), of 33.4 ± 2.5 kcal/mol and melting temperature, T(m), of 75.3 ± 2.1 °C for one variant). Furthermore, we found the α-helical stability to be strongly dependent on pH, with higher stability under lower-pH conditions (T(m) values ranging from ~92 °C at pH 4.0 to ~38 °C at pH 8.0). Mutational analysis suggests two glutamic acid residues (E579 and E580) are partially responsible for this pH-dependent behavior. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that the pH-dependent folding stability of the MARV GP2 ectodomain provides a mechanism for controlling conformational preferences such that the six-helix bundle &quot;postfusion&quot; state is preferred under conditions of appropriately matured endosomes.	2012 Mar	Harrison Joseph S,Koellhoffer Jayne F,Chandran Kartik,Lai Jonathan R	Biochemistry. 51(12) 2515-25	Marburg virus glycoprotein	QNNLVCRLR RLANQTAKSL ELLLRVTTEE RTFSLINRHA IDFLLTRWGG TCKVLGPDCC IGIEDLSKNI SEQIDQIKKD EQKEGTGWGL	552-640 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	K4MSV6		GP2 ectodomain	3.5		f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

22381466	Expression and purification of recombinant protein related to DAN and cerberus (PRDC).	Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are secreted protein ligands that control numerous biological processes, such as cell differentiation and cell proliferation. Ligands are regulated by a large number of structurally diverse extracellular antagonists. PRDC or protein related to DAN and cerberus is a BMP antagonist of the DAN family, which is defined by a conserved pattern of cysteine residues that form a ring structure. Here we present the expression and purification of recombinant mouse PRDC (mPRDC) from bacterial (Escherichia coli) inclusion bodies through oxidative refolding. Functional mPRDC was isolated from a nonfunctional component through reverse phase chromatography and shown to inhibit BMP2 and BMP4 in a cell-based luciferase reporter assay. Recombinant mPRDC also bound directly to BMP2, BMP4 and BMP7, but not activin A. Furthermore, circular dichroism indicated that mPRDC is folded and contains a higher than anticipated helical content for a DAN family member protein.	2012 Apr	Kattamuri Chandramohan,Luedeke David M,Thompson Thomas B	Protein expression and purification. 82(2) 389-95	protein related to DAN and cerberus (PRDC)	RKNRPAGAIPSPYKDGSSNNSERWHHQIKEVLASSQEALVVTERKYLKSDWCKTQPLRQTVSEEGCRSRTILNRFCYGQCNSFYIPRHVKKEEDSFQSCAFCKPQRVTSVIVELECPGLDPPFRIKKIQKVKHCRCMSVNLSDSDKQ	without signal peptide	O88273			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
22407721	Extra EF hand unit (DX) mediated stabilization and calcium independency of α-amylase.	It is the common feature of α-amylases that calcium ion is required for their structural integrity and thermal stability. All amylases have at least one Ca(2+) per molecule; therefore amino acids involved in calcium binding are specific and conserved. In this study, sequence analysis revealed the presence of EF-hand-like motif in calcium-binding loop of Bacillus megaterium WHO (BMW)-amylase that was previously isolated from BMW. The EF-hand motif and its variants (EF-hand-like motif) are the most common calcium-binding motifs found in a large number of protein families. To investigate the effect of calcium ion on the thermal stability and activity of BMW-amylase, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace histidine 58 with Asp (D), Ile (I), Tyr (Y), Phe (F), and Arg (R) at the seventh position of EF-hand-like motif. Upon the addition of an extra DX unit to the calcium-binding loop in H58D variant, thermal stability, catalytic activity, and chelating power of the enzyme improved due to higher affinity toward calcium. H58D variant demonstrated calcium independency compared to the wild type and other created mutants. Conformational changes in the presence and absence of Ca(2+) were monitored using fluorescence technique.	2013 Feb	Sadeghi Leila,Khajeh Khosro,Mollania Nasrin,Dabirmanesh Bahareh,Ranjbar Bijan	Molecular biotechnology. 53(3) 270-7	alpha-Amylase	MKGKKWTALALTLPLAASLSTGVHAETVHKGKSEAADKNGVFYEVYVNSFYDANKDGHGDLKGLTQKLDYLNDGNSHTKNDLQVNGIWMMPVNPSPSYHKYDVTDYYNIDPQYGSLQDFRKLMKEADKRDVKVIMDLVVNHTSSEHPWFQAALKDKNSKYRDYYIWADKNTDLNEKGSWGQQVWHKAPNGEYFYGTFWEGMPDLNYDNPEVRKEMINVGKFWLKQGVEGFRLDAALHIFKGQTAEGAKKNILWWNEFRDAMKKENPNVYLTGEVWDQPEVVAPYYQSLDSLFNFDLAGKIVSSVKAGNDQGIATAAAATDELFKSYNPNKIDGIFLTNHDQNRVMSELSGDVNKAKSAASILLTLPGNPYIYYGEEIGMTGEKPDELIREPFRWYEGNGLGQTSWGTPVYNKGGNGVSVEAQTKQKDSLLNHYREMIRVRQQHEELVKGTLQSISVDSKEVVAYSRTYNGNSISVYHNISNQPVRVSVAAEGKLIFASEKGAKKVKNQLVIPANRTVLIK	1-520 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	A7U965	Glycoside Hydrolase		8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	f	f

To investigate the effect of calcium ion on the thermal stability and activity of BMW-amylase, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace histidine 58 with Asp (D), Ile (I), Tyr (Y), Phe (F), and Arg (R) at the seventh position of EF-hand-like motif. Upon the addition of an extra DX unit to the calcium-binding loop in H58D variant, thermal stability, catalytic activity, and chelating power of the enzyme improved due to higher affinity toward calcium. H58D variant demonstrated calcium independency compared to the wild type and other created mutants. Conformational changes in the presence and absence of Ca(2+) were monitored using fluorescence technique.	2013 Feb	Sadeghi Leila,Khajeh Khosro,Mollania Nasrin,Dabirmanesh Bahareh,Ranjbar Bijan	Molecular biotechnology. 53(3) 270-7	alpha-Amylase	MKGKKWTALALTLPLAASLSTGVHAETVHKGKSEAADKNGVFYEVYVNSFYDANKDGIGDLKGLTQKLDYLNDGNSHTKNDLQVNGIWMMPVNPSPSYHKYDVTDYYNIDPQYGSLQDFRKLMKEADKRDVKVIMDLVVNHTSSEHPWFQAALKDKNSKYRDYYIWADKNTDLNEKGSWGQQVWHKAPNGEYFYGTFWEGMPDLNYDNPEVRKEMINVGKFWLKQGVEGFRLDAALHIFKGQTAEGAKKNILWWNEFRDAMKKENPNVYLTGEVWDQPEVVAPYYQSLDSLFNFDLAGKIVSSVKAGNDQGIATAAAATDELFKSYNPNKIDGIFLTNHDQNRVMSELSGDVNKAKSAASILLTLPGNPYIYYGEEIGMTGEKPDELIREPFRWYEGNGLGQTSWGTPVYNKGGNGVSVEAQTKQKDSLLNHYREMIRVRQQHEELVKGTLQSISVDSKEVVAYSRTYNGNSISVYHNISNQPVRVSVAAEGKLIFASEKGAKKVKNQLVIPANRTVLIK	1-520 aa, H58I mutant, C-terminal His6 tag	A7U965	Glycoside Hydrolase		8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
22429771	Substrate specificity of the recombinant alginate lyase from the marine bacteria Pseudomonas alginovora.	The gene coding for an alginate lyase from the marine bacteria Pseudomonas alginovora X017 was cloned and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli strains. The protein was produced in inclusion bodies and the active form was obtained by applying a refolding protocol based upon dilution. The biochemical characterization was performed on the active, refolded form of the alginate lyase. The substrate specificity was monitored by NMR. The degradation products were size-fractioned by size exclusion chromatography. The fractions were subsequently analyzed by ESI-MS to determine the molecular weight of the compounds. The structures of the different oligosaccharides were then elucidated by NMR. The enzyme was shown to be only acting on M-M diads. No enzymatic hydrolysis occurred between M-MG, G-MM or G-MG blocks proving that the sequence accounting for the generated oligomers by enzymatic hydrolysis is M-MM. The unsaturated oligosaccharides produced by the alginate lyase were ΔM, ΔMM, ΔMMM, and ΔMMMM indicating that the minimum structure recognized by the enzyme is the M6 oligosaccharide.	2012 Apr	Lundqvist Lena C E,Jam Murielle,Barbeyron Tristan,Czjzek Mirjam,Sandström Corine	Carbohydrate research. 352 44-50	alginate lyase	MKIISCKSIIVSSLLALSATATAGSFNDISWTLENEDNLPETDASGCALKPSTSTSTSKTFEFGLTDDSNCLDGKQRDEFKYQRRTGYNRLTGYFTIDGNYSDFNKMGVAQTHDHSTSDTGVFSIYQVRKENGSYIFGVQGDSNYSNNGWSDHPQVKISLDTRYELIIKTNGLPNGNSYEDANLYLDDVKIWSSSIEVGGEEKQYKKIGAYQLTGGEGEFHVKWDSVKLYTGK	N-terminal His tag	Q59639	poly(beta-D-mannuronate) lyase	full length			f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22440860	Identification and characterization of an amphioxus matrix metalloproteinase homolog BbMMPL2 responding to bacteria challenge.	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases mainly involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. We have cloned and identified BbMMPL2 as homolog of MMPs from adult amphioxus. Recombinant BbMMPL2 proteins underwent self-processing during refolding in vitro. The final ~23 kDa polypeptide displayed proteolytic activity against ECM components like casein, gelatin, collagen IV and fibrinogen, but not laminin, fibronectin or α1-PI. This activity could be inhibited by GM6001 and TIMP-1/2. In addition, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that BbMMPL2 expressed in all issues/organs in adult amphioxus we tested. Its transcription was significantly up-regulated 12 h post immune challenge by Escherichia coli in epidermis and hepatic diverticulum but only slightly increased by Staphyloccocus aureus in epidermis. Furthermore, recombinant BbMMPL2-EGFP expressed in 293T and NIH/3T3 cells showed aggregation in cytoplasm and induced cell death. Our results provided new evidence that MMP was involved in immune response which could be conserved through evolution.	2012 Jun	Zhang Yan,Zhang Haiqing,Kong Yu,Feng Lijun	Developmental and comparative immunology. 37(3-4) 371-80	MMPL2	MNNGMLYLQQFGYYNMSEDPTGMLGSLGTISPMMRRAVLNFQRFANIPTTGVIDEKTEEMMKKPRCGCPDVVAPPSGPVARYTRLGSRWQKNDLTYRINNFTPDLPRDQVVDAIARAFDVWAKVTPLTFRRVSGPADIEIRFAAGSHGDGNSFDSRGGVLAHAYQPGGGIGGDAHFDESEIWQIGGPTIAFLSGTDLFSVAAHEFGHSLGLGHSQVNSALMAPFYRYQSTLRLDRDDINGIQSLYGGPRPRPQPTPAPRPQPTPAPRPQPTRPPVNPPSPGGEGDADTCSGKSFDAFTRVANGTMYAFGGKYFWQLTERGVSPGYPQLIKNAWKGLPGNLDAAMFYEINGRTYFFKGDQFWRFTGDSMDSGYPRPISAWRTVNDIDAALYYGEWDGRTRTYFFKDGQYWRYTGGARASADSGYPRSLSLWRGFPTRIDAAFTSADGSRYIFRKDRYWKLAPNRAAVDTNGAYPRSVATDFLGCAKTLVDLEIEP	C-terminal His6 tag	I1TE96	Hydrolase, Metalloprotease, Protease	full length	7.6	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22450161	Recombinant expression, in vitro refolding, and biophysical characterization of the N-terminal domain of T1R3 taste receptor.	The sweet taste receptor is a heterodimeric receptor composed of the T1R2 and T1R3 subunits, while T1R1 and T1R3 assemble to form the umami taste receptor. T1R receptors belong to the family of class C G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In addition to a transmembrane heptahelical domain, class C GPCRs have a large extracellular N-terminal domain (NTD), which is the primary ligand-binding site. The T1R2 and T1R1 subunits have been shown to be responsible for ligand binding, via their NTDs. However, little is known about the contribution of T1R3-NTD to receptor functions. To enable biophysical characterization, we overexpressed the human NTD of T1R3 (hT1R3-NTD) using Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies. Using a fractional factorial screen coupled to a functional assay, conditions were determined for the refolding of hT1R3-NTD. Far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopic studies revealed that hT1R3-NTD was well refolded. Using size-exclusion chromatography, we found that the refolded protein behaves as a dimer. Ligand binding quantified by tryptophan fluorescence quenching and microcalorimetry showed that hT1R3-NTD is functional and capable of binding sucralose with an affinity in the millimolar range. This study also provides a strategy to produce functional hT1R3-NTD by heterologous expression in E. coli; this is a prerequisite for structural determination and functional analysis of ligand-binding regions of other class C GPCRs.	2012 Apr	Maîtrepierre Elodie,Sigoillot Maud,Le Pessot Laurence,Briand Loïc	Protein expression and purification. 83(1) 75-83	T1R3	APLCLSQQLR MKGDYVLGGL FPLGEAEEAG LRSRTRPSSP VCTRFSSNGL LWALAMKMAV EEINNKSDLL PGLRLGYDLF DTCSEPVVAM KPSLMFLAKA GSRDIAAYCN YTQYQPRVLA VIGPHSSELA MVTGKFFSFF LMPQVSYGAS MELLSARETF PSFFRTVPSD RVQLTAAAEL LQEFGWNWVA ALGSDDEYGR QGLSIFSALA AARGICIAHE GLVPLPRADD SRLGKVQDVL HQVNQSSVQV VLLFASVHAA HALFNYSISS RLSPKVWVAS EAWLTSDLVM GLPGMAQMGT VLGFLQRGAQ LHEFPQYVKT HLALATDPAF CSALGEREQG LEEDVVGQRC PQCDCITLQN VSAGLNHHQT FSVYAAVYSV AQALHNTLQC NASGCPAQDP VKPWQLLENM YNLTFHVGGL PLRFDSSGNV DMEYDLKLWV WQGSVPRLHD VGRFNGSLRT ERLKIRWHTS DNQKP	N-terminal His6 tag, 21-495 aa, C-terminal Strep tag II	Q7RTX0	taste receptor, G-protein coupled receptor	N-terminal domain	8.0	20	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f
22450163	High-level expression of Falcipain-2 in Escherichia coli by codon optimization and auto-induction.	Falcipain-2, the major cysteine hemoglobinase from the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is critical for parasite development and is considered a promising chemotherapeutic target. In order to facilitate the high-throughput screening of Falcipain-2 inhibitors from natural sources, we developed an economic and highly-productive overexpression system in Escherichia coli using a codon-optimized proFalcipain-2 construct. Very high expression levels (35-550f total host proteins) were observed when proFalcaipain-2 expression was induced with 1mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) in several E. coli strains, with the highest level observed for BL21(DE3). A lower expression (~400f total host proteins) was observed when BL21(DE3) was grown in ZYM-5052 auto-induction medium, containing 0.2% lactose as inducer. However, the culture grew to notably higher cellular density, increasing ~1.5 times the overall yield of the system when compared with conventional IPTG-induction. Although several conditions were modified to achieve the expression of soluble and active Falcipain-2, the enzyme was mainly obtained in the form of insoluble aggregates. After purification and refolding, ~50 mg of active enzyme were obtained per liter of culture at low cost using a regular incubator shaker, and recombinant Falcipain-2 exhibited structural and functional characteristics very similar to the natural counterpart. Due to its versatility and simplicity, this strategy can be straightforwardly adapted to other proteins from Plasmodium species or any other organism with an AT-rich genome.	2012 Apr	Sarduy Emir Salas,Muñoz Aymara Cabrera,Trejo Sebastián Alejandro,de los A Chavéz Planes María	Protein expression and purification. 83(1) 59-69	Falcipain-2	KE LNRFADLTYH EFKNKYLSLR SSKPLKNSKY LLDQMNYEEV IKKYRGEENF DHAAYDWRLH SGVTPVKDQK NCGSCWAFSS IGSVESQYAI RKNKLITLSE QELVDCSFKN YGCNGGLINN AFEDMIELGG ICPDGDYPYV SDAPNLCNID RCTEKYGIKN YLSVPDNKLK EALRFLGPIS ISVAVSDDFA FYKEGIFDGE CGDQLNHAVM LVGFGMKEIV NPLTKKGEKH YYYIIKNSWG QQWGERGFIN IETDESGLMR KCGLGTDAFI PLIE	N-terminal His6 tag, 209-484 aa	Q9N6S8	cysteine-type peptidase	the last 35 residues of the pro-domain and the catalytic domain of the enzyme	9.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22467743	Analysis of the conformation and function of the Plasmodium falciparum merozoite proteins MTRAP and PTRAMP.	Thrombospondin repeat (TSR)-like domains are structures involved with cell adhesion. Plasmodium falciparum proteins containing TSR domains play crucial roles in parasite development. In particular, the preerythrocytic P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein is involved in hepatocyte invasion. The importance of these domains in two other malaria proteins, the merozoite-specific thrombospondin-related anonymous protein (MTRAP) and the thrombospondin-related apical membrane protein (PTRAMP), were assessed using near-full-length recombinant proteins composed of the extracellular domains produced in Escherichia coli. MTRAP is thought to be released from invasive organelles identified as micronemes during merozoite invasion to mediate motility and host cell invasion through an interaction with aldolase, an actin binding protein involved in the moving junction. PTRAMP function remains unknown. In this study, the conformation of recombinant MTRAP (rMTRAP) appeared to be a highly extended protein (2 nm by 33 nm, width by length, respectively), whereas rPTRAMP had a less extended structure. Using an erythrocyte binding assay, rMTRAP but not rPTRAMP bound human erythrocytes; rMTRAP binding was mediated through the TSR domain. MTRAP- and in general PTRAMP-specific antibodies failed to inhibit P. falciparum development in vitro. Altogether, MTRAP is a highly extended bifunctional protein that binds to an erythrocyte receptor and the merozoite motor.	2012 Apr	Uchime Onyinyechukwu,Herrera Raul,Reiter Karine,Kotova Svetlana,Shimp Richard L,Miura Kazutoyo,Jones Dominique,Lebowitz Jacob,Ambroggio Xavier,Hurt Darrell E,Jin Albert J,Long Carole,Miller Louis H,Narum David L	Eukaryotic cell. 11(5) 615-25	thrombospondin-related apical membrane protein (PTRAMP)	NDLCSC NLKVRNNWEH FLQVYQNNGN FKMEILEPEC TIQKNLPSEE EKEEFIDFDR KELLLHDFVV IKNSQFTDEK TLELYLSKEE NNKSYLMLTF YLGDLKLMIG HNSPYEISLI LNVATVNKNM SNCKNNSYNI VLLKTTDVFN TSDLEILEGP IQFSLGKSSG AFRINVTNFF LNNTWKAFTK DKISFLIKPE ENCYTILENK INKPQLLIEK KTTFYSEWGE WSNCSMDCDH PDNVQIRERE CIHPSGDCFK GDLKESRPCI IPLPPCNELF SHKDNSTFK	25-309 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	Q8I5M8	protease binding		8.0	10	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f

22481531	Construction, expression and refolding of a bifunctional fusion protein consisting of C-terminal 12-residue of hirudin-PA and reteplase.	To obtain a bifunctional protein simultaneously showing bioactivity of anticoagulant and fibrinolytic for use in the treatment of thrombotic diseases, we constructed a fusion protein (HV12p-rPA) containing C-terminal 12-residue of hirudin-PA (HV12p) and reteplase (rPA). The fusion protein, in which HV12p was linked to rPA via Gly-Gly-Gly, was successfully expressed in an inactive form of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. HV12p-rPA was identified by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The expression level of HV12p-rPA was optimized by an orthogonal method and finally enhanced from 12 0 approximate 30 %. We also deeply investigated the condition of renaturation of HV12p-rPA, and the inactive protein was partly renatured through various conditions. The refolding efficacy of HV12p-rPA estimated by the recovery of fibrinolytic activity varied from 0.03 0 16.6 % and the anticoagulant activity fluctuated in the range from 41 to 2,297 ATU/mg. Bioassays indicated that the resulted fusion protein, as expected, exhibited both fibrinolytic and anticoagulant activities.

22495983	Trypsin resistance of the major peanut allergen Ara h 6 and allergenicity of the digestion products are abolished after selective disruption of disulfide bonds.	SCOPE:2S-albumins Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 are the most widely recognized and potent allergens for peanut-allergic patients. These allergens are particularly resistant to proteolysis and the digestion products generally retain significant allergenicity.

22538317	Purification, refolding and characterization of the trimeric Omp2a outer membrane porin from Brucella melitensis.	Brucella melitensis is a gram-negative bacteria known to cause brucellosis and to produce severe infections in humans. Whilst brucella&#39;s outer membrane proteins have been extensively studied due to their potential role as antigens or virulence factors, their function is still poorly understood at the structural level, as the 3D structure of Brucella β-barrel membrane proteins are still unknown. In this context, the B. melitensis trimeric Omp2a porin has been overexpressed and refolded in n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside. We here show that this refolding process is insensitive to urea but is temperature- and ionic strength-dependent. Reassembled species were characterized by fluorescence, size-exclusion chromatography and circular dichroism. A refolding mechanism is proposed, suggesting that Omp2a first refolds under a monomeric form and then self-associates into a trimeric state. This first complete in vitro refolding of a membrane protein from B. melitensis shall eventually lead to functional and 3D structure determination.	2012 May	Roussel G,Matagne A,De Bolle X,Perpète E A,Michaux C	Protein expression and purification. 83(2) 198-204	Omp2a	ADAIVAPEPEAVEYVRVCDAYGAGYFYIPGTETCLRVHGYVRYDVKGGDDVYSGTDRNGWDKGARFALMFNTNSETELGTLGTYTQLRFNYTSNNSRHDGQYGDFSDDRDVADGGVSTGTDLQFAYITLGGFKVGIDESEFHTFTGYLGDVINDDVVAAGSYRTGKIAYTFTGGNGFSAVIALEQGGEDVDNDYTIDGYMPHVVGGLKYAGGWGSIAGVVAYDSVIEEWATKVRGDVNITDRFSVWLQGAYSSAATPNQNYGQWGGDWAVWGGAKFIAPEKATFNLQAAHDDWGKTAVTANVAYQLVPGFTITPEVSYTKFGGEWKDTVAEDNAWGGIVRFQRSF	without signal peptide	Q7CNU3	porin, ion transport		8	40	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f
22554820	Intein-mediated expression, purification, and characterization of thymosin α1-thymopentin fusion peptide in Escherichia coli.	Thymosin α1-thymopentin (Tα1-TP5) fusion peptide has been proved to be an immune regulator based on its higher immunoregulatory activity than Tα1 and TP5. To obtain Tα1-TP5 more effectively and economically, Tα1-TP5 was genetically fused to a self-cleaving intein-chitin binding domain tag for purification via chitin beads in Escherichia coli. After affinity purification, the target peptide was released from the chitin beads via self-cleaving intein ((INTervening protEIN) induced by dithiothreitol. Further, Tα1-TP5 was purified by Superdex 30 and identified by Tricine-SDS-PAGE and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Finally, about 7.6 mg Tα1-TP5 purified from the soluble fraction and inclusion bodies was obtained from 1 L culture media. The purity was 95% after a series of chromatographic purification steps. In vitro, the purified Tα1-TP5 could stimulate the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. Overall, this work demonstrated that Tα1-TP5 was purified with low cost and high efficiency, greatly expanding its potential use as an immune regulator.	2012 Jun	Li Juan,Zheng Lei,Li Pingli,Wang Fengshan	Protein expression and purification. 84(1) 1-8	Thymosin alpha 1	SDAAVDTSS EITTKDLKEK KEVVEEAEN	2-29 aa, Thymosin alpha 1–Thymopentin(Arg-Lys-Asp-Val-Tyr)–Sce intein-chitin binding domain fusion protein	P06454			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22564875	Electrostatic interaction-induced inclusion body formation of glucagon-like peptide-1 fused with ubiquitin and cationic tag.	In an attempt to produce glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) using recombinant Escherichia coli, ubiquitin (Ub) as a fusion partner was fused to GLP-1 with the 6-lysine tag (K6) for simple purification. Despite the high solubility of ubiquitin, the fusion protein K6UbGLP-1 was expressed mainly as insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli. In order to elucidate this phenomenon, various N- and C-terminal truncates and GLP-1 mutants of K6UbGLP-1 were constructed and analyzed for their characteristics by various biochemical and biophysical methods. The experiment results obtained in this study clearly demonstrated that the insoluble aggregation of K6UbGLP-1 was attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the N-terminal 6-lysine tag and the C-terminal GLP-1 before the completion of folding which might be one of the reasons for protein misfolding frequently observed in many foreign proteins introduced with charged amino acid residues such as the His tag and the protease recognition sites. The application of a cation exchanger for neutralizing the positive charge of the 6-lysine tag in solid-phase refolding of K6UbGLP-1 successfully suppressed the electrostatic interaction-driven aggregation even at a high protein concentration, resulting in properly folded K6UbGLP-1 for GLP-1 production.	2012 Jun	Kim Sung-Gun,Min Won-Ki,Rho Yong-Taek,Seo Jin-Ho	Protein expression and purification. 84(1) 38-46	glucagon-like peptide-1	HAEGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFIAWLVKGRG	98-128 aa, 6-lysine tagged ubiquitin fused to GLP-1	P01275	Hormone		7.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f

22641057	Integrated refolding techniques for Schistosoma japonicum MTH1 overexpressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.	The full-length cDNA of MTH1in Schistosoma japonicum was previously isolated. However, insoluble protein expression in Escherichia coli is the biggest bottleneck limiting biological and biophysical studies. Protein aggregation could not be significantly prevented using solubilization or refolding techniques, and denatured MTH1 protein could not be refolded to the native monomer form. Hence, integrating several refolding techniques within the protein refolding process of MTH1, a large amount of active MTH1 was obtained for protein crystallization. We primarily utilized the two-step-denaturing and refolding method and the protein refolding screening technique, as well as the continuous dialysis method. First, we identified the refolding buffer composition that allowed for successful refolding to overcome protein precipitation. Next, we used the two-step-denaturing and refolding method and the continuous dialysis method to suppress protein aggregation. In the end, we obtained 15 mg of active MTH1 monomer with 951fb7850urity from 0.5l medium. Integrated refolding techniques proved to be excellent for obtaining the native monomer of S. japonicum MTH1 from inclusion bodies, paving the way for future biological and biophysical studies.	2012 Jul	Feng Yanye,Liu Lu,Wang Jipeng,Liu Jian,Hu Wei,Wang Xiaoning,Yang Zhong	Protein expression and purification. 84(2) 181-7	MutT homolog-1	MPVSKDKLSPFTSHWVNRKLYTLMLVIYTPGELNKECPLVIDKSGSEIHVQESDINCDSKSWLLLGLKQRGFGKGRWNGFGGKVQSNDVNPKAGALRELYEESGLVIDQSSVDEVGRLWFTFPEASECMEVYVFTCRNWTPTHNGHTIQWPCYTEEMYPAWFPLGINEDGTVNLSTLPFDLMWPDDHLWFPHIFHGNLFLGWFHFTELSNQSTVSSQNLADCSKEANGVSFDRYEVPAYHLESFIDDKKKLYHIEEDNNCKQSSTLQQIIDQLELDKNDDNLRLWMNSLLYNKETVITPSNLMKTLHYLPLT	N-termianl His6 tag	Q5D8J6	hydrolase	full length	8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
22642296	A smallest 6 kda metalloprotease, mini-matrilysin, in living world: a revolutionary conserved zinc-dependent proteolytic domain- helix-loop-helix catalytic zinc binding domain (ZBD).	BACKGROUND:The Aim of this study is to study the minimum zinc dependent metalloprotease catalytic folding motif, helix B Met loop-helix C, with proteolytic catalytic activities in metzincin super family. The metzincin super family share a catalytic domain consisting of a twisted five-stranded β sheet and three long α helices (A, B and C). The catalytic zinc is at the bottom of the cleft and is ligated by three His residues in the consensus sequence motif, HEXXHXXGXXH, which is located in helix B and part of the adjacent Met turn region. An interesting question is - what is the minimum portion of the enzyme that still possesses catalytic and inhibitor recognition?&quot;METHODS:We have expressed a 60-residue truncated form of matrilysin which retains only the helix B-Met turn-helix C region and deletes helix A and the five-stranded β sheet which form the upper portion of the active cleft. This is only 1/4 of the full catalytic domain. The E. coli derived 6 kDa MMP-7 ZBD fragments were purified and refolded. The proteolytic activities were analyzed by Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 peptide assay and CM-transferrin zymography analysis. SC44463, BB94 and Phosphoramidon were computationally docked into the 3 day structure of the human MMP7 ZBD and TAD and thermolysin using the docking program GOLD.RESULTS:This minimal 6 kDa matrilysin has been refolded and shown to have proteolytic activity in the Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 peptide assay. Triton X-100 and heparin are important factors in the refolding environment for this mini-enzyme matrilysin. This minienzyme has the proteolytic activity towards peptide substrate, but the hexamer and octamer of the mini MMP-7 complex demonstrates the CM-transferrin proteolytic activities in zymographic analysis. Peptide digestion is inhibited by SC44463, specific MMP7 inhibitors, but not phosphorimadon. Interestingly, the mini MMP-7 can be processed by autolysis and producing ~ 6 ~ 7 kDa fragments. Thus, many of the functions of the enzyme are retained indicating that the helix B-Met loop-helix C is the minimal functional &quot;domain&quot; found to date for the matrixin family.CONCLUSIONS:The helix B-Met loop-helix C folding conserved in metalloprotease metzincin super family is able to facilitate proteolytic catalysis for specific substrate and inhibitor recognition. The autolysis processing and producing 6 kDa mini MMP-7 is the smallest metalloprotease in living world.	2012 Jul	Yu Wei-Hsuan,Huang Po-Tsang,Lou Kuo-Long,Yu Shuan-Su C,Lin Chen	Journal of biomedical science. 19 54	Matrilysin	GVN FLFVATHELG HSLGLGHSSV PSSVMYPTYQ GDHSEDFSLT KDDIAGIQKL YGKRNKL	208-267 aa	P50280	Hydrolase, Metalloprotease, Protease	zinc binding domain	5.6	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22644527	Recombinant production of mGLP-1 by coupling of refolding and intein-mediated self-cleavage (CRIS).	Glucagon-like peptide-1 as an endogenous glucose-lowering peptide is a promising candidate for anti-diabetic drug development. Here, we developed a convenient method by coupling of refolding and intein-mediated self-cleavage (CRIS) to improve the recombinant production of a mutated glucagon-like peptide-1 (mGLP-1). Bacterial cell culture employing auto-induction was performed at 37 °C to avoid the intracellular self-cleavage of the intein fusion protein. The impacts of urea, pH, and temperature on the efficiency of CRIS were tested, and then, the optimized CRIS was established. Using the optimized method, we obtained the purified mGLP-1 with a yield of 3.41 mg peptide/g bacterial cells which was 5.6-fold higher than before. After that, using chromatography, peptide electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry, we determined the purity and molecular weight of the purified peptide and then confirmed its glucose-lowering activity by performing glucose tolerance test in mice. These results suggest that CRIS is a relatively simple and efficacious method for the recombinant production of mGLP-1, and as a general method, it can also be used for the recombinant preparation of some other proteins and peptides.	2012 Nov	Gao Mingming,Tong Yue,Tian Hong,Gao Xiangdong,Yao Wenbing	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 96(5) 1283-90	Glucagon-like peptide-1	HGEGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFIAWLVRGR	98-127 aa, A99G, K125R mutant, N-termianl chitin binding domain and DnaB intein fusion protein	P01275	Hormone		7.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22672968	Expression and characterization of recombinant soluble porcine CD3 ectodomain molecules: mapping the epitope of an anti-porcine CD3 monoclonal antibody 898H2-6-15.	The porcine CD3 specific monoclonal antibody 898H2-6-15 has been used in allo- and xeno-transplantation studies as a porcine CD3 marker and as an effective T cell depletion reagent when conjugated to the diphtheria toxin mutant, CRM9. A recombinant anti-porcine CD3 immuntoxin was recently developed using single-chain variable fragments (scFv) derived from 898H2-6-15. In this study, using published sequence data, we have expressed the porcine CD3 ectodomain molecules in E. coli through inclusion body isolation and in vitro refolding approach. The expressed and refolded porcine CD3 ectodomain molecules include CD3ε, CD3γ, CD3δ, CD3εγ heterodimer, CD3εδ heterodimer, CD3εγ single-chain fusion protein and CD3εδ single-chain fusion protein. These refolded porcine CD3 ectodomain molecules were purified with a strong anion exchange resin Poros 50HQ. ELISA analysis demonstrated that only the porcine CD3εγ ectodomain single-chain fusion protein can bind to the porcine CD3 specific monoclonal antibody 898H2-6-15. The availability of this porcine CD3εγ ectodomain single-chain fusion protein will allow screening for affinity matured variants of scFv derived from 898H2-6-15 to improve the recombinant anti-porcine CD3 immunotoxin.

These refolded porcine CD3 ectodomain molecules were purified with a strong anion exchange resin Poros 50HQ. ELISA analysis demonstrated that only the porcine CD3εγ ectodomain single-chain fusion protein can bind to the porcine CD3 specific monoclonal antibody 898H2-6-15. The availability of this porcine CD3εγ ectodomain single-chain fusion protein will allow screening for affinity matured variants of scFv derived from 898H2-6-15 to improve the recombinant anti-porcine CD3 immunotoxin. Porcine CD3εγ ectodomain single-chain fusion protein will also be a very useful reagent to study the soluble phase interaction between porcine CD3εγ and porcine CD3 antibodies such as 898H2-6-15.	2012 Jul	Peraino Jaclyn Stromp,Hermanrud Christina E,Springett Lauren,Zhang Huiping,Li Guoying,Srinivasan Srimathi,Gusha Ashley,Sachs David H,Huang Christene A,Wang Zhirui	Cellular immunology. 276(1-2) 162-7	CD3 epsilon	EDIERPDE DTQKTFKVSI SGDKVELTCP EDPESEKMTW KRNDMQIYES YDNYMLLESF SEVENSGYYT CTVGEKTSHR LYLKARVCEN CVEVD	23-115 aa, CD3 epsilon delta fusion protein(epsilon-(G4S)3–delta–His6)	Q7YRN2	receptor	ectodomain	8.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22683476	Human caspases in vitro: expression, purification and kinetic characterization.	A number of strategies and protocols for the expression, purification and kinetic characterization of human caspases are described in the literature. We have systematically revised these protocols and present comprehensive optimized expression and purification protocols for caspase-1 to -9 as well as improved assay conditions for their reproducible kinetic characterization. Our studies on active site titration revealed that the reproducibility is strongly affected by the presence of DTT in the assay buffer. Furthermore, we observed that not all caspases show a linear relationship between enzymatic activity and protein concentration, which explains the discrepancy between published values of specific activities from different laboratories. Our broad kinetic analysis allows the conclusion that the dependency of caspase activities on protein concentration is an effect of concentration-dependent dimerization, which can also be influenced by kosmotropic salts. The protocol recommendations as an outcome of this work will yield higher reproducibility regarding expression and purification of human caspases and contribute to standardization of enzyme kinetic data.	2012 Jul	Roschitzki-Voser Heidi,Schroeder Thilo,Lenherr Esther D,Frölich Franziska,Schweizer Andreas,Donepudi Mrudula,Ganesan Rajkumar,Mittl Peer R E,Baici Antonio,Grütter Markus G	Protein expression and purification. 84(2) 236-46	Caspase-1	NPAMPTSSGSEGNVKLCSLEEAQRIWKQKSAEIYPIMDKSSRTRLALIICNEEFDSIPRRTGAEVDITGMTMLLQNLGYSVDVKKNLTASDMTTELEAFAHRPEHKTSDSTFLVFMSHGIREGICGKKHSEQVPDILQLNAIFNMLNTKNCPSLKDKPKVIIIQACRGDSPGVVWFKD	120-297 aa	P29466	Hydrolase, Protease, Thiol protease	large subunit	8.0	20	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f

22691543	Codon optimization for high level expression of human bone morphogenetic protein-2 in Escherichia coli.	Codons in the open reading frame (ORF) encoding for human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (hBMP-2) were optimized to reach high level expression in Escherichia coli. The optimization was done by the computer programs DNA works and DNA Star according to Thermodynamically Balanced Inside Out (TBIO) approach. The ORF consisting of 342 base pairs (bp) was assembled using two-steps Polymerase Chain Reaction, cloned into a pGEM-T vector with a mutation rate of 6.38 bp per kb and transformed into E. coli JM109. After a DNA sequence confirmation, mutation-free ORF was subcloned into pET32b and transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3). The rhBMP-2 was produced as a thioredoxin-his-tag fusion protein at relatively high level, approximately 600f total intracellular proteins as inclusion bodies (IB), with a yield of 1.39 g per liter culture. Solubilization of IB gave soluble monomer rhBMP-2 with a recovery of 13.6% and refolding of soluble rhBMP-2 produced dimeric forms with a yield of 8.7%. The size and identity of the purified rhBMP-2 was confirmed by nano-LC-MS/MS2 analysis. Our work demonstrates for the first time that by using TBIO approach, a codon-optimized ORF encoding for rhBMP-2 protein can be expressed at high level in E. coli expression system.	2012 Jul	Retnoningrum Debbie S,Pramesti H T,Santika P Y,Valerius O,Asjarie S,Suciati T	Protein expression and purification. 84(2) 188-94	bone morphogenetic protein-2	QAKHKQRKRLKSSCKRHPLYVDFSDVGWNDWIVAPPGYHAFYCHGECPFPLADHLNSTNHAIVQTLVNSVNSKIPKACCVPTELSAISMLYLDENEKVVLKNYQDMVVEGCGCR	283-396 aa, N-terminal Trx and His6 tag	P12643	Cytokine, Developmental protein, Growth factor		7.5	10	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22693546	Sequence-specific binding of recombinant Zbed4 to DNA: insights into Zbed4 participation in gene transcription and its association with other proteins.	Zbed4, a member of the BED subclass of Zinc-finger proteins, is expressed in cone photoreceptors and glial Müller cells of human retina whereas it is only present in Müller cells of mouse retina. To characterize structural and functional properties of Zbed4, enough amounts of purified protein were needed. Thus, recombinant Zbed4 was expressed in E. coli and its refolding conditions optimized for the production of homogenous and functionally active protein. Zbed4&#39;s secondary structure, determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy, showed that this protein contains 32% α-helices, 18% β-sheets, 200rns and 300nordered structures. CASTing was used to identify the target sites of Zbed4 in DNA. The majority of the DNA fragments obtained contained poly-Gs and some of them had, in addition, the core signature of GC boxes; a few clones had only GC-boxes. With electrophoretic mobility shift assays we demonstrated that Zbed4 binds both not only to DNA and but also to RNA oligonucleotides with very high affinity, interacting with poly-G tracts that have a minimum of 5 Gs; its binding to and GC-box consensus sequences. However, the latter binding depends on the GC-box flanking nucleotides. We also found that Zbed4 interacts in Y79 retinoblastoma cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins Scaffold Attachment Factor B1 (SAFB1), estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and cellular myosin 9 (MYH9), as shown with immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry studies as well as gel overlay assays. In addition, immunostaining corroborated the co-localization of Zbed4 with these proteins. Most importantly, in vitro experiments using constructs containing promoters of genes directing expression of the luciferase gene, showed that Zbed4 transactivates the transcription of those promoters with poly-G tracts.	2012 Jun	Mokhonov Vladislav V,Theendakara Veena P,Gribanova Yekaterina E,Ahmedli Novruz B,Farber Debora B	PloS one. 7(5) e35317	Zbed4	MEDKQETCPKGDSDFVSDKVNFKTEEDDDQTPCHSLEQVDFKSESEDMRQTDSGDEQADIRAASCACQPSGKFLAAESEDDYGSLFSQYSSTLYSVAMEAVTQSLLSSRHISSRKKSPAWKHFFISPRDSTKAICTYCMKEFSRGKNEKDLSTSCLMRHVRRAHPTKLIQENGSLSAGSSFSPPSLLLPPQPADVGDLSTVLSPVRLVQKMAPKIPSPDQIMEESVTVVSSEELSSDVSVTEKYSREEALAGSSPNLSMLHYDDASETMADRNLSLPKSTSGSRRRSAVWKHFYLSPLDSSKAVCVHCMNEFSRGKNGKDLGTSCLIRHMWRAHRSIVLQENGGNTGIPPLYPMPPTLLPALLPPEGDLNSASLSPGKQVKESPSASSSPERLPEDLSSHTNPGDVSREDVSMLSSSDDLGEASVVSSPEKQPADTVNPRFESGTVFQQNKKVMRRLKSEVWHHFSLAPMDSLKAVCRYCSCVISRGKKGDVGTSCLMRHLYRRHPEVVGNQKDFLGASLANSPYATLASAESSSKLTDLPAVVRKNHQGVFPTNSKKTSKLWNHFSICSADSTKVVCLHCGRTISRGKKPTNLGTSCLLRHLQRFHGHVLKNDVSEATLSRSPGIRRPLGIELSGPSSFRDSTEKFYDSHPVAKKITSLIAEMIALDLQPYSLVDNVGFNRLLEYLKPQYSLPSPSYFSRTAIPGMYDNVKQIIMSHLKEAESGVVHFTSGIWMSSQTREYLTLTAHWVTFASAVRPHCEDHHCSALLDVSQIDCDYSGNSIQKQLECWWEAWVTSIGLQIGITVTDNPSIGKMLSEGEHSSVQCFSHTVNLIVSEAIKSQRMVQNLLSIARKLCERVHRSPRAREKLAELQKEYELPQHQLIQDVPSKWSTSFHMLERLIEQKRAVNEVSIECNFRELISCDQWEVMQSVCHVLRPFDAASREMSAHMSTLSQVIPMIHILSRKVEMLFGETMGIDTMLKSLKEAMASRLSATLHDPRYIFATLLDPRYKASLFTEEEAEQYRQDLIRELEILNSTSEDTATSNGCDSGSPLKDTGTEESLWSLAPIKRDQREKLPEDMVLAYLEEEVLEHSCDPLTYWNLKRSSWPGLSTLAVRFLGCPPSTVPSEKLFSTPMDAGSFGQPRLMMEHFEKLIFLKVNLPLICFQY	C-terminal His8 tag	Q80WQ9	DNA binding, metal ion binding	full length	7.5		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
22713621	Expression, refolding, and purification of active diacetylchitobiose deacetylase from Pyrococcus horikoshii.	A chitinase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus degrades chitin to produce diacetylchitobiose [(GlcNAc)(2)] as the end product. To further investigate the degradation mechanism of (GlcNAc)(2) in Pyrococcus spp., we cloned the gene of PH0499 from Pyrococcus horikoshii, which encodes a protein homologous to the diacetylchitobiose deacetylase of Thermococcus kodakaraensis. The deacetylase (Ph-Dac) was overexpressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) pLys. The insoluble inclusion body was solubilized and reactivated through a refolding procedure. After several purification steps, 40 mg of soluble, thermostable (up to 80°C) Ph-Dac was obtained from 1L of culture. The apparent molecular mass of the refolded Ph-Dac was 180 kDa, indicating Ph-Dac to be a homohexamer. The refolded Ph-Dac also exhibited deacetylase activity toward (GlcNAc)(2), and the deacetylation site was revealed to be specific to the nonreducing end residue of (GlcNAc)(2). These expression and purification systems are useful for further characterization of Ph-Dac.	2012 Jul	Mine Shouhei,Ikegami Takahisa,Kawasaki Kazunori,Nakamura Tsutomu,Uegaki Koichi	Protein expression and purification. 84(2) 265-9	diacetylchitobiose deacetylase	MVVNMFEDIDTFEEAFNKLLREVLEFDLQNPFKDAKKVLCIEPHPDDCVIGMGGTIKKLSDMGVEVIYVCMTDGYMGTTDESLSGHELAAIRRKEEEESARLLGVKKIYWLNYRDTELPYSREVRKDLTKILRKEQPDGVFAPDPWLPYESHPDHRRTGFLAIESVAFSQLPNFSNTDLDIGLNPYNSGSFIALYYTHKPNYIVDITDLMELKLKAIRVHRSQFPDDIWEKWEPFLRTIAMFYGEKIGVRYGEGFRIMPGLFYHITPFTDLI	N-teminal Trx and His6 tag	O58235	metal ion binding	full length	8.0	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
22718633	Biochemical characterization and structural modeling of human cathepsin E variant 2 in comparison to the wild-type protein.	Cathepsin E splice variant 2 appears in a number of gastric carcinomas. Here we report detecting this variant in HeLa cells using polyclonal antibodies and biotinylated inhibitor pepstatin A. An overexpression of GFP fusion proteins of cathepsin E and its splice variant within HEK-293T cells was performed to show their localization. Their distribution under a fluorescence microscope showed that they are colocalized. We also expressed variants 1 and 2 of cathepsins E, with propeptide and without it, in Escherichia coli. After refolding from the inclusion bodies, the enzymatic activity and circular dichroism spectra of the splice variant 2 were compared to those of the wild-type mature active cathepsins E. While full-length cathepsin E variant 1 is activated at acid pH, the splice variant remains inactive. In contrast to the active cathepsin E, the splice variant 2 predominantly assumes β-sheet structure, prone to oligomerization, at least under in vitro conditions, as shown by atomic force microscopy as shallow disk-like particles. A comparative structure model of splice variant 2 was computed based on its alignment to the known structure of cathepsin E intermediate (Protein Data Bank code 1TZS) and used to rationalize its conformational properties and loss of activity.	2012 Jun	Puizdar Vida,Zajc Tajana,Zerovnik Eva,Renko Miha,Pieper Ursula,Eswar Narayanan,Sali Andrej,Dolenc Iztok,Turk Vito	Biological chemistry. 393(3) 177-86	cathepsin E	AQGSLHRVPLRRHPSLKKKLRARSQLSEFWKSHNLDMIQFTESCSMDQSAKEPLINYLDMEYFGTISIGSPPQNFTVIFDTGSSNLWVPSVYCTSPACKTHSRFQPSQSSTYSQPGQSFSIQYGTGSLSGIIGADQVSVEGLTVVGQQFGESVTEPGQTFVDAEFDGILGLGYPSLAVGGVTPVFDNMMAQNLVDLPMFSVYMSSNPEGGAGSELIFGGYDHSHFSGSLNWVPVTKQAYWQIALDNIQVGGTVMFCSEGCQAIVDTGTSLITGPSDKIKQLQNAIGAAPVDGEYAVECANLNVMPDVTFTINGVPYTLSPTAYTLLDFVDGMQFCSSGFQGLDIHPPAGPLWILGDVFIRQFYSVFDRGNNRVGLAPAVP	isoform1, without signal peptide	P14091	aspartic-type endopeptidase		8.0		t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

22722101	High pressure refolding, purification, and crystallization of flavin reductase from Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7.	Flavin reductase HpaC(St) catalyzes the reduction of free flavins using NADH or NADPH. High hydrostatic pressure was used for the solubilization and refolding of HpaC(St), which was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli to achieve high yield in a flavin-free form. The refolded HpaC(St) was purified using Ni-affinity chromatography followed by a heat treatment, which gave a single band on SDS-PAGE. The purified refolded HpaC(St) did not contain FMN, unlike the same enzyme expressed as a soluble protein. After the addition of FMN to the protein solution, the refolded enzyme showed a higher activity than the enzyme expressed as the soluble protein. Crystals of the refolded enzyme were obtained by adding FMN, FAD, or riboflavin to the protein solution and without the addition of flavin compound.	2012 Jul	Okai Masahiko,Ohtsuka Jun,Asano Atsuko,Guo Linjun,Miyakawa Takuya,Miyazono Ken-ichi,Nakamura Akira,Okada Akitoshi,Zheng Hai,Kimura Kenzo,Nagata Koji,Tanokura Masaru	Protein expression and purification. 84(2) 214-8	Flavin reductase HpaC	MAEVIKSIMRKFPLGVAIVTTNWKGELVGMTVNTFNSLSLNPPLVSFFADRMKGNDIPYKESKYFVVNFTDNEELFNIFALKPVKERFREIKYKEGIGGCPILYDSYAYIEAKLYDTIDVGDHSIIVGEVIDGYQIRDNFTPLVYMNRKYYKLSSL		Q974C9	Oxidoreductase	full length	10	room temperature	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	t	f
22736063	In vitro Ca(2+)-dependent maturation of milk-clotting recombinant Epr: minor extracellular protease: from Bacillus licheniformis.	The minor extracellular protease (Epr) is secreted into the culture medium during Bacillus licheniformis, strain USC13, stationary phase of growth. Whereas, B. subtilis Epr has been reported to be involved in swarming; the B. licheniformis protease is also involved in milk-clotting as shown by the curd forming ability of culture broths expressing this protein. The objectives of this study are the characterization of recombinant B. licheniformis Epr (minor extracellular protease) and the determination of its calcium-dependent activation process. In this work, we have cloned and expressed B. licheniformis Epr in Escherichia coli. We were also able to construct a tridimensional model for Epr based on its homology to Thermococcus kodakarensis pro-tk-subtilisin 2e1p, fervidolysin from Fervidobacterium pennivorans 1rv6, and B. lentus 1GCI subtilisin. Recombinant Epr was accumulated into inclusion bodies; after protein renaturation, Epr undergoes an in vitro calcium-dependent activation, similar to that described for tk protease. The recombinant Epr is capable of producing milk curds with the same clotting activity previously described for the native B. licheniformis Epr enzyme although further rheological and industrial studies should be carried out to confirm its real applicability. This work represents for the first time that Epr may be successfully expressed in a non-bacilli microorganism.	2013 Apr	Ageitos José Manuel,Vallejo Juan Andrés,Serrat Manuel,Sánchez-Pérez Angeles,Villa Tomás G	Molecular biotechnology. 54(2) 304-11	minor extracellular protease	MKKLWKIAVSAAMFVGFFANSPRIQAESNKQENEVIVVYKNTSGKETVIEQADTVEHVYRHIPAAAVTADDKTVRELEHDPDVLYVEDNLPVAAADSTALKAFSSSTAQNASAFSQWNIKLIQAALAWNKGLTGKQVKIAVIDSGISPHEELSIAGGASMVGYTASYRDDNGHGTHVAGIIGAKHNGRGIDGIAPGAQLYAVKALDRNGAGDLKGILQGIDWSIQHGIDIINMSLVVSGDSQVLHDAVDKAYKRGIILVGASGNAGNGKSVYYPAAYSSVIAVSATNEKNQIASFSNTGSAVEFSAPGTSIISTSSDRGYAIGSGTSQATPHVTGMFALLKQLYPTASNAELRKKMQFYTSDLGAPGRDHLFGYGLIRFKEVTQPLEKAQKAVGQAEKTKKKADIQTAQKAIEPLPADADKTALKKRLNTVKEQLKKTAESKVKLAEKQKKKTNADSAQKAVNELDSGTFKTNLQKRINAVRSSLLKTAKQAVAKAEKAATDSNLGKAQKAINELPAGKDKSNLQKRLNTAKKQAAAAYNKKVSAAKAKVKTAEQKRTKKTKSAAQSAVGKLKASAEKTKLQKRINAIKLK	N-terminal His6 tag	Q65LN3	serine-type endopeptidase	full length	7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22760822	Mutagenic analysis in a pure molecular system shows that thioredoxin-interacting protein residue Cys247 is necessary and sufficient for a mixed disulfide formation with thioredoxin.	The human thioredoxin (TRX)-interacting protein is found in multiple subcellular compartments and plays a major role in redox homeostasis, particularly in the context of metabolism (e.g., lipidemia and glycemia) and apoptosis. A molecular approach to the protein&#39;s modus operandi is still needed because some aspects of the TRX-interacting protein-mediated regulation of TRX are not clearly understood. To this end, His-tagged TRX-interacting proteins were over-expressed in Escherichia coli. Because the protein is expressed mainly in inclusion bodies, it was denatured in high concentrations of guanidium hydrochloride, centrifuged, and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. His-TRX-interacting protein was then refolded by dialysis and its restructuring monitored by circular dichroism spectrometry. This preparation resulted in the formation of a covalent complex with recombinant human TRX, demonstrating that association occurs without the intervention of other partner proteins. Multiple cysteine-to-serine mutants of TRX-interacting protein were produced and purified. These mutations were efficient in limiting the formation of disulfide-linked homo-oligomers in an oxidizing environment. The mutants were also used to gain functional insight into the formation of the TRX-interacting protein-TRX complexes. These complexes were able to form in the absence of internal disulfide bridges. A mutant with all but one cysteine changed to serine (Cys ²⁴⁷) also showed an enhanced capacity to form complexes with TRX demonstrating, in a pure molecular system, that this particular cysteine is likely responsible for the disulfide bridge between TRX-interacting protein and TRX.	2012 Aug	Fould Benjamin,Lamamy Véronique,Guenin Sophie-Penelope,Ouvry Christine,Cogé Francis,Boutin Jean A,Ferry Gilles	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 21(9) 1323-33	Thioredoxin-interacting protein	MVMFKKIKSFEVVFNDPEKVYGSGEKVAGRVIVEVCEVTRVKAVRILACGVAKVLWMQGSQQCKQTSEYLRYEDTLLLEDQPTGENEMVIMRPGNKYEYKFGFELPQGPLGTSFKGKYGCVDYWVKAFLDRPSQPTQETKKNFEVVDLVDVNTPDLMAPVSAKKEKKVSCMFIPDGRVSVSARIDRKGFCEGDEISIHADFENTCSRIVVPKAAIVARHTYLANGQTKVLTQKLSSVRGNHIISGTCASWRGKSLRVQKIRPSILGCNILRVEYSLLIYVSVPGSKKVILDLPLVIGSRSGLSSRTSSMASRTSSEMSWVDLNIPDTPEAPPCYMDVIPEDHRLESPTTPLLDDMDGSQDSPIFMYAPEFKFMPPPTYTEVDPCILNNNVQ	N-terminal His6 tag	Q9H3M7	enzyme inhibitor activity, ubiquitin protein ligase binding	full length	8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
22771632	High cell density cultivation of recombinant Escherichia coli for prodrug of recombinant human GLPs production.	Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)(2) has been attracting increasing interest on account of its prominent benefits in type 2 diabetes. However, its clinical applications are limited by the short half-life in vivo. To overcome this limitation, a new polymer of GLP-1 was developed by prodrug strategy. In this study a recombinant protein, rhGLPs, was successfully constructed, cloned into plasmid pET30a (+) and expressed in Escherichia coli ArcticExpress(DE3)RP in the form of inclusion body. The recombinant fusion protein productivity could be enhanced by high cell density culture of the recombinant strain. As a result, about 40 g wet weight cells per liter were obtained. The protein was purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column and refolded using reverse dilution and dialysis methods. SDS-PAGE, HPLC and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were undertaken to determine the purity and molecular weight of rhGLPs. Bioactivity assay revealed that it had glucose-lowering and insulin-releasing action in vivo.	2012 Aug	Zhou Ying,Ma Xue,Hou Zheng,Xue Xiaoyan,Meng Jingru,Li Mingkai,Jia Min,Luo Xiaoxing	Protein expression and purification. 85(1) 38-43	Glucagon-like peptide-1	HDEFERHAEGTFTSDVSSYLEGQAAKEFIAWLVKGRG	92-128 aa, N-terminal His6 tag, repeated recombinant GLP-1 linked by linker peptide	P01275	Hormone		8.0		t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22809717	Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of recombinant alpha phosphoglucomutase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv.	Phosphoglucomutase (PGM) plays an important role in polysaccharide capsule formation and virulence in a number of bacterial pathogens. However, the enzyme has not yet been characterized from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Here, we report the biochemical properties of recombinant Mtb-PGM as well as the in silico structural analysis from Mtb H37Rv. The purified recombinant enzyme was enzymatically active with a specific activity of 67.5 U/mg and experimental k(cat) of 70.31 s(-1) for the substrate glucose-1-phosphate. The enzyme was stable in pH range 6.5-7.4 and exhibited temperature optima range between 30 and 40°C. Various kinetic parameters and constants of the rPGM were determined. A structural comparison of Modeller generated 3D Mtb-PGM structure with rabbit muscle PGM revealed that the two enzymes share the same overall heart shape and four-domain architecture, despite having only 17equence identity. However, certain interesting differences between the two have been identified, which provide an opportunity for designing new drugs to specifically target the Mtb-PGM. Also, in the absence of the crystal structure of the Mtb-PGM, the modeled structure could be further explored for in silico docking studies with suitable inhibitors.	2012 Aug	Chhabra Gagan,Mathur Divya,Dixit Aparna,Garg Lalit C	Protein expression and purification. 85(1) 117-24	alpha phosphoglucomutase	MVANPRAGQPAQPEDLVDLPHLVTAYYSIEPDPDDLAQQVAFGTSGHRGSALTGTFNELHILAITQAIVEYRAAQGTTGPLFIGRDTHGLSEPAWVSALEVLAANQVVAVVDSRDRYTPTPAISHAILTYNRGRTEALADGIVVTPSHNPPSDGGIKYNPPNGGPADTAATTAIAKRANEILLARSMVKRLPLARALRTAQRHDYLGHYVDDLPNVVDIAAIREAGVRIGADPLGGASVDYWGEIAHRHGLDLTVVNPLVDATWRFMTLDTDGKIRMDCSSPDAMAGLIRTMFGNRERYQIATGNDADADRHGIVTPDEGLLNPNHYLAVAIEYLYTHRPSWPAGIAVGKTVVSSSIIDRVVAGIGRQLVEVPVGFKWFVDGLIGATLGFGGEESAGASFLRRDGSVWTTDKDGIIMALLAAEILAVTGATPSQRYHALAGEYGGPCYARIDAPADREQKARLARLSADQVSATELAGEPITAKLTTAPGNGAALGGLKVTTANAWFAARPSGTEDVYKIYAESFRGPQHLVEVQQTAREVVDRVIG	N-terminal His6 tag	I6Y2G3	phosphoglucomutase	full length	7.4	room temperature	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
22825834	Expression, renaturation and biological activity of recombinant conotoxin GeXIVAWT.	Conotoxins are a diverse array of small peptides mostly with multiple disulfide bridges. These peptides become an increasing significant source of neuro-pharmacological probes and drugs as a result of the high selectivity for ion channels and receptors. Conotoxin GeXIVAWT (CTX-GeXIVAWT) is a 28-amino acid peptide containing five cysteines isolated from the venom of Conus generalis. Here, we present a simple and fast strategy of producing disulfide-rich conotoxins via recombinant expression. The codes of novel conotoxin gene GeXIVAWT were optimized and generated two pairs of primers by chemical synthesis for construction of expression vector. Recombinant expression vector pET22b(+)-GeXIVAWT fused with pelB leader and His-tag was successfully expressed as an insoluble body in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Recombinant conotoxin GeXIVAWT (rCTX-GeXIVAWT) was obtained by dissolving the insoluble bodies and purifying with a Ni-NTA affinity column, which was further purified using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The rCTX-GeXIVAWT renatured in vitro could inhibited the growth of Sf9 cell with biological activity assay. This expression system may prove valuable for future structure-function studies of conotoxins.	2013 Jan	Gao Bingmiao,Zhangsun Dongting,Wu Yong,Lin Bo,Zhu Xiaopeng,Luo Sulan	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 97(3) 1223-30	conotoxin GeXIVAWT	TCRSSGRYCRSPYDCRRRYCRRITDACV	47-74 aa, pelB leader signal peptide, C-terminal His6 tag	J7GY56	ion channel inhibitor, Neurotoxin, Toxin		8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22833227	Expression, reconstruction and characterization of codon-optimized carbonic anhydrase from Hahella chejuensis for CO2 sequestration application.	The high production of functional carbonic anhydrase (CA) is required for practical CO2 sequestration application mediated by CA. Here, the synthetic gene based on Escherichia coli codon usage of new α-type CA (HC-aCA) of Hahella chejuensis, a Korea marine microorganism, was highly expressed in E. coli. We obtained a high yield of functional HC-aCA by denaturing/refolding process and incorporating zinc ion into its active site. The refolded HC-aCA displayed a half-deactivation temperature of 60 °C with maximal activity at 50 °C, and had high pH stability in alkali condition with maximal activity at pH 10.0. The esterase activity of HC-aCA almost doubled at high salt concentration ranging from 0.67 to 2.0 M NaCl. HC-aCA catalyzed the conversion of CO2 to CaCO3 as calcites form in the presence of Ca(2+). The refolded HC-aCA could be a promising candidate for the development of efficient CA-based CO2 sequestration processes.	2013 Mar	Ki Mi-Ran,Min Kiha,Kanth Bashistha Kumar,Lee Jinwon,Pack Seung Pil	Bioprocess and biosystems engineering. 36(3) 375-81	alpha-type carbonic anhydrase	MIRRLIWVLAGVTACGQALASGESHWGYDEPERWGELKPEYTMCSAGKNQSPVDISGLIKGELPAVGMNYSSGGHEVINNGHTIQVNYKPGSKASVDGREFELKQFHFHAPSENTVDGKSFPLEAHFVHANENGELAVLSVLYEEGEHNEQLAKVWEHMPAEAGGSKVLPTAVHAGDMVSASAGYYRFNGSLTTPPCSEGVRWLVMKDYRTASKEQINQFMETMGGPTNRPVQGVNARIILH		Q2SNS4	carbonate dehydratase	full length	8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22871671	Recombinant haemagglutinin protein of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus expressed in Pichia pastoris elicits a neutralizing antibody response in mice.	Recombinant avian influenza vaccines offer several advantages over the conventional vaccines. In this study, the haemagglutinin (HA) gene of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was cloned and expressed as His tagged protein in methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris. The expression of recombinant HA (rHA) protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis. The rHA protein was purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions and the functions of the protein was assessed by the haemagglutinin assay after refolding. The immunogenicity of the rHA was evaluated by immunizing four groups of mice with different payloads (2.5, 5.0, 10 and 25μg) of purified rHA and the production of rHA specific antibodies were analysed by haemagglutinin inhibition assay (HI) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An antigen specific immune response was observed against rHA indicating that the rHA antigen could be used as a vaccine candidate against avian influenza. These results suggest that this strategy would pave the way for the development of rapid and cost effective method for the production of an avian influenza vaccine.	2012 Dec	Murugan Subathra,Ponsekaran Santhakumar,Kannivel Lingaraja,Mangamoori Lakshmi Narasu,Chandran Dev,Villuppanoor Alwar Srinivasan,Chakravarty Chandrani,Lal Sunil K	Journal of virological methods. 187(1) 20-5	haemagglutinin	MEKIVLLLAIVSLVKSDQICIGYHANNSTEQVDTIMEKNVTVTHAQDILEKTHNGKLCALDGVKPLILRDCSVAGWLLGNPMCDEFINVPEWSYIVEKANPVNDLCYPGDFNDYEELKHLLSRINHFEKIQIIPKSSWSSHEASLGVSSACPYQGKSSFFRNVVWLIKKNSTYPTIKRSYNNTNQEDLLVLWGIHHPNDAAEQIKLYQNPTTYISVGTSTLNQRLVPRIATRSKVNGQSGRMEFFWTILKPNDAINFESNGNFIAPEYAYKLVKKGDSTIMKSELEYGNCNTKCQTPMGAINSSMPFHNIHPLTIGECPKYVKSNRLVLATGLRNSPQRERRRKKRGLFGAIAGFIEGGWQGMVDGWYGYHHSNEQGSGYAADKESTQKAIDGVTNKVNSIIDKMNTQFEAVGREFNNLERRIENLNKKMEDGFLDVWTYNAELLVLMENERTLDFHDSNVKNLYDKVRLQLRDNAKELGNGCFEFYHKCDNECMESVRSGTYDYPQYSEEARLKREEISGVKLESIGIYQILSIYSTVASSLALAIMVAGLSLWMCSNGSLQCRICI	C-terminal His6 tag	Q5QQ29	Hemagglutinin	full length	8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
22872497	Studies on the refolding process of recombinant horseradish peroxidase.	Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is an important heme-containing glyco-enzyme that has been used in many biotechnological fields. Valuable proteins like HRP can be obtained in sufficient amounts using Escherichia coli as an expression system. However, frequently, the expression of recombinant enzyme results in inclusion bodies, and the refolding yield is generally low for proteins such as plant peroxidases. In this study, a recombinant HRP was cloned and expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. Initially, the influence of few additives on HRP refolding was assessed by the one factor at a time method. Subsequently, factors with significant effects including glycerol, GSSG/DTT, and the enzyme concentration were selected for further optimization by means of the central composite design of response surface methodology (RSM). Under the obtained optimal condition, refolding increased about twofold. The refolding process was then monitored by the intrinsic fluorescence intensity under optimal conditions (0.35 mM GSSG, 0.044 mM DTT, 7  0lycerol, 1.7 M urea, and 2 mM CaCl2 in 20 mM Tris, pH 8.5) and the reconstitution of heme to the refolded peroxidase was detected by the Soret absorbance. Additionally, samples under unfolding and refolding conditions were analyzed by Zetasizer to determine size distribution in different media.	2013 Apr	Asad Sedigheh,Dabirmanesh Bahareh,Ghaemi Nasser,Etezad Seyed Masoud,Khajeh Khosro	Molecular biotechnology. 54(2) 484-92	Horseradish peroxidase	QLTPTFYDNSCPNVSNIVRDTIVNELRSDPRIAASILRLHFHDCFVNGCDASILLDNTTSFRTEKDAFGNANSARGFPVIDRMKAAVESACPRTVSCADLLTIAAQQSVTLAGGPSWRVPLGRRDSLQAFLDLANANLPAPFFTLPQLKDSFRNVGLNRSSDLVALSGGHTFGKNQCRFIMDRLYNFSNTGLPDPTLNTTYLQTLRGLCPLNGNLSALVDFDLRTPTIFDNKYYVNLEEQKGLIQSDQELFSSPNATDTIPLVRSFANSTQTFFNAFVEAMDRMGNITPLTGTQGQIRLNCRVVNSNS	31-338 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	P00433	Oxidoreductase, Peroxidase		8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
27342372	A class-A GPCR solubilized under high hydrostatic pressure retains its ligand binding ability.	The effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on the solubilization of a class-A G protein-coupled receptor, the silkmoth pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide receptor (PBANR), was investigated. PBANR was expressed in expresSF+ insect cells as a C-terminal fusion protein with EGFP. The membrane fraction was subjected to HHP treatment (200MPa) at room temperature for 1-16h in the presence of 0-2.0% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM). The solubilization yield of PBANR-EGFP in the presence of 0.6% (w/v) DDM increased to ~1.5-fold after 1h HHP treatment. Fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that the PBANR-EGFP ligand binding ability was retained after HHP-mediated solubilization. The PBANR-EGFP solubilized with 1.0 0DM under HHP at room temperature for 6h retained ligand binding ability, whereas solubilization in the absence of HHP treatment resulted in denaturation.	2016 Jul	Katayama Yukie,Suzuki Tatsuya,Ebisawa Tatsuki,Ohtsuka Jun,Wang Shipeng,Natsume Ryo,Lo Yu-Hua,Senda Toshiya,Nagamine Toshihiro,Hull J Joe,Matsumoto Shogo,Nagasawa Hiromichi,Nagata Koji,Tanokura Masaru	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1858(9) 2145-51	pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide receptor (PBANR)	MMADETVNMEMLENNLLNVTNVTDQSSAYSESYPLHLLVPLSVTYAVIFIVGILGNTSTCVVIARNRSMHTATNFYLFSLAISDIILLVCGLPLELYRLWNPFTYPLGEAQCITIGLASETSANATVLTITAFTMERYIAICRPFMSHTMSKLSRAVRFIIAIWVFALCTAVPQAMQFGIVSYVENGQSMSACTVKGPGVHQVFVISSFVFFVVPMSVISVLYALIGLKLRTSRILHPVKKLSLDSNERPGAHTPYRNGSSQRRVIRMLVAVALSFFICWAPFHVQRLLAIYGKSLEHPSDTFYLVYIVLTFLSGVLYFLSTAINPFLYNIMSNKFRNAFKMTLAAWCGRRGGPRMGRSYSALLASQRQRAANGLTDPVRGPRRLRRLSTATTHLCDAPPRAQVSATKIAISP	PBANR(28-353; T4L@ICL3)-tev-EGFP-His10	Q65YS4	Controls PBAN-mediated sex pheromone biosynthesis activation in the pheromone glands of many female moths.

23638106	Prokaryotic ubiquitin-like ThiS fusion enhances the heterologous protein overexpression and aggregation in Escherichia coli.	Fusion tags are commonly employed to enhance target protein expression, improve their folding and solubility, and reduce protein degradation in expression of recombinant proteins. Ubiquitin (Ub) and SUMO are highly conserved small proteins in eukaryotes, and frequently used as fusion tags in prokaryotic expression. ThiS, a smaller sulfur-carrier protein involved in thiamin synthesis, is conserved among most prokaryotic species. The structural similarity between ThiS and Ub provoked us into expecting that the former could be used as a fusion tag. Hence, ThiS was fused to insulin A and B chains, murine Ribonuclease Inhibitor (mRI) and EGFP, respectively. When induced in Escherichia coli, ThiS-fused insulin A and B chains were overexpressed in inclusion bodies, and to higher levels in comparison to the same proteins fused with Ub. On the contrast, ThiS fusion of mRI, an unstable protein, resulted in enhanced degradation that was not alleviated in protease-deficient strains. While the degradation of Ub- and SUMO-fused mRI was less and seemed protease-dependent. Enhanced degradation of mRI did not occur for the fusions with half-molecules of ThiS. When ThiS-tag was fused to the C-terminus of EGFP, higher expression, predominantly in inclusion bodies, was observed again. It was further found that ThiS fusion of EGFP significantly retarded its refolding process. These results indicated that prokaryotic ThiS is able to promote the expression of target proteins in E. coli, but enhanced degradation may occur in case of unstable targets. Unlike eukaryotic Ub-based tags usually increase the solubility and folding of proteins, ThiS fusion enhances the expression by augmenting the formation of inclusion bodies, probably through retardation of the folding of target proteins.	2013 May	Yuan Sujuan,Xu Jian,Ge Ying,Yan Zheng,Du Guohua,Wang Nan	PloS one. 8(4) e62529	ThiS	MQILFNDQAMQCAAGQTVHELLEQLDQRQAGAALAINQQIVPREQWAQHIVQDGDQILLFQVIAGG		O32583	Thiamine biosynthesis	full length	7.4	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f

23658852	A novel hyaluronidase from brown spider (Loxosceles intermedia) venom (Dietrich&#39;s Hyaluronidase): from cloning to functional characterization.	Loxoscelism is the designation given to clinical symptoms evoked by Loxosceles spider&#39;s bites. Clinical manifestations include skin necrosis with gravitational spreading and systemic disturbs. The venom contains several enzymatic toxins. Herein, we describe the cloning, expression, refolding and biological evaluation of a novel brown spider protein characterized as a hyaluronidase. Employing a venom gland cDNA library, we cloned a hyaluronidase (1200 bp cDNA) that encodes for a signal peptide and a mature protein. Amino acid alignment revealed a structural relationship with members of hyaluronidase family, such as scorpion and snake species. Recombinant hyaluronidase was expressed as N-terminal His-tag fusion protein (∼45 kDa) in inclusion bodies and activity was achieved using refolding. Immunoblot analysis showed that antibodies that recognize the recombinant protein cross-reacted with hyaluronidase from whole venom as well as an anti-venom serum reacted with recombinant protein. Recombinant hyaluronidase was able to degrade purified hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), while dermatan sulfate (DS) and heparan sulfate (HS) were not affected. Zymograph experiments resulted in ∼45 kDa lytic zones in hyaluronic acid (HA) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) substrates. Through in vivo experiments of dermonecrosis using rabbit skin, the recombinant hyaluronidase was shown to increase the dermonecrotic effect produced by recombinant dermonecrotic toxin from L. intermedia venom (LiRecDT1). These data support the hypothesis that hyaluronidase is a &quot;spreading factor&quot;. Recombinant hyaluronidase provides a useful tool for biotechnological ends. We propose the name Dietrich&#39;s Hyaluronidase for this enzyme, in honor of Professor Carl Peter von Dietrich, who dedicated his life to studying proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans.	2013 May	Ferrer Valéria Pereira,de Mari Thiago Lopes,Gremski Luiza Helena,Trevisan Silva Dilza,da Silveira Rafael Bertoni,Gremski Waldemiro,Chaim Olga Meiri,Senff-Ribeiro Andrea,Nader Helena Bonciani,Veiga Silvio Sanches	PLoS neglected tropical diseases. 7(5) e2206	hyaluronidase	FDVFWNVPSQQCKKYGMKFVPLLEQYSILVNKEDNFKGDKITIFYESQLGLYPHIGANDESFNGGIPQLGDLKAHLEKSAVDIRRDILDKSATGLRIIDWEAWRPIWEFNWSSLRKYQDKMKKVVRQFNPTAHESTVAKLAHNEWENSSKSWMLSTLQLGKQLRPNSVWCYYLFPDCYNYDGNSVQEFQCSEAIRKGNDRLKWLWEESTAVCPSIYIKEGQLTNYTLQKRIWFTNGRLQEALRVAQPKARIYPYINYSIKPGMMVPEVEFWRLIAQIASLGMDGAVIWGSSASVGSKNHCAQLMKYIADVLGPATLRIKENVARCSKQACSGRGRCTWPKDTSVIAWKFLVEKEDYDFYLGDIECKCVEGYEGRYCEQKTK	N-terminal His6 tag, without signal peptide	R4J7Z9	Hydrolase		10.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
23663929	Isolation and bioinformatic analysis of seven genes encoding potato apyrase. Bacterial overexpresssion, refolding and initial kinetic studies on some recombinant potato apyrases.	Here we have isolated seven apyrase encoding cDNA sequences (StAPY4-StAPY10) from the potato variety Saturna tuber cDNA library by affecting necessary modifications in the screening protocol. The cDNA sequences were identified with a pair of primers complementary to the most conserved sequences identified in potato variety Desiree apyrase genes. Our data strongly suggest the multigenic nature of potato apyrase. All deduced amino acid sequences contain a putative signal sequence, one transmembrane region at the amino terminus and five apyrase conserved regions (ACRs) (except StAPY6). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that encoded proteins shared high level of DNA sequence identity among themselves, representing a family of proteins markedly distinct from other eukaryotic as well as prokaryotic apyrases. Two cDNA sequences (StAPY4 and StAPY6) were overexpressed in bacteria and recombinant proteins were found accumulated in inclusion bodies, even thought they were fused with thioredoxin-tag. Additionally, we present the first successful in vitro attempt at reactivation and purification of recombinant potato apyrase StAPY6. The ratio of ATPase/ADPase hydrolysis of recombinant StAPY6 was determined as 1.5:1. Unlike other apyrases the enzyme lacked ACR5 and was endowed with lower molecular weight, high specificity for purine nucleotides and very low specificity for pyrimidine, suggesting that StAPY6 is a potato apyrase, not described so far.	2013 Jul	Wujak Magdalena,Banach Mariusz,Porowińska Dorota,Piskulak Katarzyna,Komoszyński Michał	Phytochemistry. 93 8-17	apyrase 6	MLTKNSHFILSILTIFLFLPLSLLSKNVNAQISRKTDSLTHASEHYAVIFDAGSTGSRVHVFRFDQKLGLLPIGNNIEYFMATEPGLSSYAEDPKTAANSLEPLLDGAEGVVPQELQSQTPLELGATAGLRMLKGDAAEKILQAVRNLVKNQSTFHSKDQWVTILDGTQEGSYMWAAINYLLGNLGKDYKSTTATIDLGGGSVQMAYAISNEQFANAPKNEDGEPYVQQKHLMSKDYNLYVHSYLNYGQLAGRAEIFKASRNESNPCALEGYDGYYSYGGVDYRVKAPKKGSSLKKCRNLTRQALRIKAQCKNKNCTFNGVWNGGGEYSCFIIFL	N-terminal thioredoxin-tag, 6xHis-tag and S-tag		Hydrolase		6.5	13	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
23675452	N-terminal helix-cap in α-helix 2 modulates β-state misfolding in rabbit and hamster prion proteins.	Susceptibility of a particular species to prion disease is affected by small differences in the sequence of PrP and correlates with the propensity of its PrP to assume the β-state. A helix-cap motif in the β2-α2-loop of native α-helical rabbit PrP, a resistant species, contains sequence differences that influence intra- and interspecies transmission. To determine the effect the helix-cap motif on β-state refolding propensity, we mutated S170N, S174N, and S170N/S174N of the rabbit PrP helix-cap to resemble that of hamster PrP and conversely, N170S, N174S, and N170S/N174S of hamster PrP to resemble the helix-cap of rabbit PrP. High-resolution crystal structures (1.45-1.6 Å) revealed that these mutations ablate hydrogen-bonding interactions within the helix-cap motif in rabbit PrP(C). They also alter the β-state-misfolding propensity of PrP; the serine mutations in hamster PrP decrease the propensity up to 35%, whereas the asparagine mutations in rabbit PrP increase it up to 42%. Rapid dilution of rabbit and hamster into β-state buffer conditions causes quick conversion to β-state monomers. Kinetic monitoring using size-exclusion chromatography showed that the monomer population decreases exponentially mirrored by an increase in an octameric species. The monomer-octamer transition rates are faster for hamster than for rabbit PrP. The N170S/N174S mutant of hamster PrP has a smaller octamer component at the endpoint compared to the wild-type, whereas the kinetics of octamer formation in mutant and wild-type rabbit PrP are comparable. These findings demonstrate that the sequence of the β2-α2 helix-cap affects refolding to the β-state and subsequently, may influence susceptibility to prion disease.	2013 May	Sweeting Braden,Brown Eric,Khan M Qasim,Chakrabartty Avijit,Pai Emil F	PloS one. 8(5) e63047	Prion Protein	AVVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPLIHFGNDYEDRYYRENMYRYPNQVYYRPVDQYSNQNSFVHDCVNITVKQHTVTTTTKGENFTETDIKIMERVVEQMCITQYQQESQAAYQRAA	121-230, N-terminal His6 tag	Q95211	prion		8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

23675452	N-terminal helix-cap in α-helix 2 modulates β-state misfolding in rabbit and hamster prion proteins.	Susceptibility of a particular species to prion disease is affected by small differences in the sequence of PrP and correlates with the propensity of its PrP to assume the β-state. A helix-cap motif in the β2-α2-loop of native α-helical rabbit PrP, a resistant species, contains sequence differences that influence intra- and interspecies transmission. To determine the effect the helix-cap motif on β-state refolding propensity, we mutated S170N, S174N, and S170N/S174N of the rabbit PrP helix-cap to resemble that of hamster PrP and conversely, N170S, N174S, and N170S/N174S of hamster PrP to resemble the helix-cap of rabbit PrP. High-resolution crystal structures (1.45-1.6 Å) revealed that these mutations ablate hydrogen-bonding interactions within the helix-cap motif in rabbit PrP(C). They also alter the β-state-misfolding propensity of PrP; the serine mutations in hamster PrP decrease the propensity up to 35%, whereas the asparagine mutations in rabbit PrP increase it up to 42%. Rapid dilution of rabbit and hamster into β-state buffer conditions causes quick conversion to β-state monomers. Kinetic monitoring using size-exclusion chromatography showed that the monomer population decreases exponentially mirrored by an increase in an octameric species.

23707937	Upd3--an ancestor of the four-helix bundle cytokines.	The unpaired-like protein 3 (Upd3) is one of the three cytokines of Drosophila melanogaster supposed to activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway (Janus tyrosine kinases/signal transducer and activator of transcription). This activation occurs via the type-I cytokine receptor domeless, an orthologue of gp130, the common signal transducer of all four-helix bundle interleukin-6 (IL-6) type cytokines. Both receptors are known to exist as preformed dimers in the plasma membrane and initiate the acute-phase response. These facts indicate an evolutionary relation between vertebrate IL-6 and the Drosophila protein Upd3. Here we presented data which strengthen this notion. Upd3 was recombinantly expressed, a renaturation and purification protocol was established which allows to obtain high amounts of biological active protein. This protein is, like human IL-6, a monomeric-α helical cytokine, implicating that Upd3 is an &quot;ancestor&quot; of the four-helix bundle cytokines.	2013 Jun	Oldefest Mirja,Nowinski Jana,Hung Chien-Wen,Neelsen Denis,Trad Ahmad,Tholey Andreas,Grötzinger Joachim,Lorenzen Inken	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 436(1) 66-72	Upd3	TNPLKHLQKRSRAANFRLTFQQKLNASSTHLDWENTCNLKPTGLNETHSKAKRCKKRQRILQNLQNQTGRELRGIQAEDKARITTNADKLATVSTKTLDIVEKNKWRFYKGNYRFLPRLNLTSKQLNLRHAHRDLQIYVGAFTYMRNIKLHWDLANLQAKSVLSDELGRMRKSAREVLCSVEEAINLTNLLYTPNRQRAPQPRGQKKRRQAQPVVTYKILPRKLMEKRLQQFNSTLVPLVELHQQATLAARGEDVPPPPDDLMVLEQHALFTKLKFVQYLKSIRKILANQRKSLCKATTHVPKAIQKKL	T93-L401, N-terminal His6 tag	Q59E38	cytokine activity		8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
23709058	Inhibition of Japanese encephalitis virus infection by flavivirus recombinant E protein domain III.	Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the human pathogens including yellow fever virus, dengue virus and West Nile virus. There are currently no effective antiviral therapies for all of the flavivirus and only a few highly effective vaccines are licensed for human use. In this paper, the E protein domain III (DIII) of six heterologous flaviviruses (DENV1-4, WNV and JEV) was expressed in Escherichia coli successfully. The proteins were purified after a solubilization and refolding procedure, characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Competitive inhibition showed that all recombinant flavivirus DIII proteins blocked the entry of JEV into BHK-21 cells. Further studies indicated that antibodies induced by the soluble recombinant flavivirus DIII partially protected mice against lethal JEV challenge. These results demonstrated that recombinant flavivirus DIII proteins could inhibit JEV infection competitively, and immunization with proper folding flavivirus DIII induced cross-protection against JEV infection in mice, implying a possible role of DIII for the cross-protection among flavivirus as well as its use in antigens for immunization in animal models.	2013 Jun	Fan Jingjing,Liu Yi,Xie Xuping,Zhang Bo,Yuan Zhiming	Virologica Sinica. 28(3) 152-60	DENV1 DIII	KLTLKGMSYV MCTGSFKLEK EVAETQHGTV LVQVKYEGTD APCKIPFSTQ DEKGVTQNGR LITANPIVTD KEKPINIETE PPFGESYIIV GAGEKALKLS WFKKGSSIGK	N-terminal His6 tag, 571-680aa	Q9II02	receptor-binding	E protein DIII region	7.9	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

23716035	Expression, purification, and refolding of active recombinant human E-selectin lectin and EGF domains in Escherichia coli.	Attempts to obtain active E-selectin from Escherichia coli (E. coli) have not yet been successful. In this study, we succeeded in expressing the recombinant lectin and epidermal growth factor domain fragments of human E-selectin (rh-ESLE) in E. coli on a large-scale. The rh-ESLE protein was expressed as an inactive form in the inclusion bodies. The inactive form of rh-ESLE was denatured and solubilized by 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and then purified by Ni(2+) affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. Denatured rh-ESLE was then refolded by a rapid-dilution method using a large amount of refolding buffer, which contained arginine and cysteine/cystine. The refolded rh-ESLE showed binding affinity for sLe(X) (K(d) = 321 nM, B(max) = 1.9 pmol/μg protein). This result suggests that the refolded rh-ESLE recovered its native and functional structure.	2013 Jul	Kawano Susumu,Iyaguchi Daisuke,Okada Chiaki,Sasaki Yusuke,Toyota Eiko	The protein journal. 32(5) 386-91	E-selectin	WSYNTSTEA MTYDEASAYC QQRYTHLVAI QNKEEIEYLN SILSYSPSYY WIGIRKVNNV WVWVGTQKPL TEEAKNWAPG EPNNRQKDED CVEIYIKREK DVGMWNDERC SKKKLALCHT AACTNTSCSG HGECVETINN YTCKCDPGFS GLKCE	C-terminal His6 tag, 22-175aa	B2RAJ1		lectin and epidermal growth factor domains	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
23729565	In vitro maturation of Drosophila melanogaster Spätzle protein with refolded Easter reveals a novel cleavage site within the prodomain.	Dorsoventral patterning during Drosophila melanogaster embryogenesis is mediated by a well-defined gradient of the mature NGF-like ligand Spätzle. Easter, the ultimate protease of a ventrally-restricted serine protease cascade, plays a key role in the regulation of the morphogenic gradient, catalyzing the activation cleavage of proSpätzle. As a result of alternative splicing, proSpätzle exists in multiple isoforms, almost all of which differ only in their prodomain. Although this domain is unstructured in isolation, it has a stabilizing influence on the mature cystine knot domain and is involved in the binding to the Toll receptor. Here, we report the expression and refolding of Easter, and show that the renatured enzyme performs the activation cleavage of two Spätzle isoforms. We determine the affinity of the prodomain for the cystine knot domain, and show that Easter performs a previously unknown secondary cleavage in each prodomain.	2013 Jul	Ursel Christian,Fandrich Uwe,Hoffmann Anita,Sieg Torsten,Ihling Christian,Stubbs Milton T	Biological chemistry. 394(8) 1069-75	Easter	GQFYFPNEAAQVPNYGRCITPNRERALCIHLEDCKYLYGLLTTTPLRDTDRLYLSRSQCGYTNGKVLICCPDRYRESSSETTPPPKPNVTSNSLLPLPGQCGNILSN IEG RIYGGMKTKIDEFPWMALIEYTKSQGKKGHHCGGSLISTRYVITASHCVNGKALPTDWRLSGVRLGEWDTNTNPDCEVDVRGMKDCAPPHLDVPVERTIPHPDYIPASKNQVNDIALLRLAQQVEYTDFVRPICLPLDVNLRSATFDGITMDVAGWGKTEQLSASNLKLKAAVEGSRMDECQNVYSSQDILLEDTQMCAGGKEGVDSCRGDSGGPLIGLDTNKVNTYYFLAGVVSFGPTPCGLAGWPGVYTLVGKYVDWIQNTIES	C-terminal His6 tag, Replacement of the natural Snake recognition site (LSN15R-16I) with that for Factor Xa by insertion of the tripeptide sequence IEG (LSNIEG15R-16I)	P13582	serine protease	full length	8.5	8	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
23748965	Preliminary studies on the renaturation of denatured catfish (Clarias gariepinus) glutathione transferase.	Purified juvenile catfish (Clarias gariepinus) glutathione transferase (cgGST) was denatured in vitro and renatured in the absence and presence of different concentrations of endogenous or xenobiotic model substrates. Protein transitions during unfolding and refolding were monitored by activity measurement as well as changes in protein conformation using UV difference spectra at 230 nm. Gdn-HCl at 0.22 M caused 50  0nactivation of the enzyme and at 1.1 M, the enzyme was completely unfolded. Refolding of cgGST main isozyme was not completely reversible at higher concentrations of Gdn-HCl and is dependent on protein concentration. An enzyme concentration of 30 μg/ml yielded 40 1fb7850ercentage residual activity in the presence of glutathione (GSH), regardless of the concentration that was present as opposed to 30 0btained in its absence. The xenobiotic model substrate, lindane, appears to have no effect on the refolding of the enzyme. In summary, our results show that GSH assists in the refolding of cgGST in a concentration-independent manner and may be involved in the same function in vivo whereas the xenobiotic model substrate does not.	2013 Nov	Ojopagogo Yetunde Adedolapo,Adewale Isaac Olusanjo,Afolayan Adeyinka	Fish physiology and biochemistry. 39(6) 1657-63	glutathione transferase				oxidoreductase		6.5		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The fibrillation of Serum Amyloid A (SAA) - a major acute phase protein - is believed to play a role in the disease Amyloid A (AA) Amyloidosis. To better understand the amyloid formation pathway of SAA, we characterized the oligomerization, misfolding, and aggregation of a disease-associated isoform of human SAA - human SAA1.1 (hSAA1.1) - using techniques ranging from circular dichroism spectroscopy to atomic force microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, immunoblot studies, solubility measurements, and seeding experiments. We found that hSAA1.1 formed alpha helix-rich, marginally stable oligomers in vitro on refolding and cross-beta-rich aggregates following incubation at 37°C. Strikingly, while hSAA1.1 was not highly amyloidogenic in vitro, the addition of a single N-terminal methionine residue significantly enhanced the fibrillation propensity of hSAA1.1 and modulated its fibrillation pathway. A deeper understanding of the oligomerization and fibrillation pathway of hSAA1.1 may help elucidate its pathological role.	2013 Jun	Patke Sanket,Srinivasan Saipraveen,Maheshwari Ronak,Srivastava Sunit K,Aguilera J Javier,Colón Wilfredo,Kane Ravi S	PloS one. 8(6) e64974	Serum Amyloid A	RSFFSFLGEAFDGARDMWRAYSDMREANYIGSDKYFHARGNYDAAKRGPGGVWAAEAISDARENIQRFFGHGAEDSLADQAANEWGRSGKDPNHFRPAGLPEKY		P0DJI8	G-protein coupled receptor binding	full length	8.3	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	t	f	f	f

23796075	Consequences of proline-to-alanine substitutions for the stability and refolding of onconase.	Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization reactions can make for rate-limiting steps in protein folding due to their high activation energy. Onconase, an unusually stable ribonuclease A homologue from the Northern leopard frog, contains four trans proline residues in its native state. During the refolding from its guanidine hydrochloride unfolded state, which includes the formation of a folding intermediate, the slowest of the three phases has earlier been attributed to a cis-to-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerization reaction. We thus substituted all four proline residues individually by alanine and investigated the effect of the amino acid substitutions on the folding and stability of the onconase variants. All onconase variants proved to adopt a tertiary structure comparable with that of the wild-type protein. Although the slow phase was not eliminated for any of the variants, the P43A substitution resulted in an increase in the rate constant of the fast folding phase, i.e. a faster formation of the folding intermediate. This variant also exhibits a significant increase in thermodynamic stability. As residue 43 belongs to those residues that are protected from hydrogen exchange with the solvent in the folding intermediate, the increase in the rate constant and stability of the P43A variant emphasizes the importance of the intermediate for the folding of onconase.	2013 Sep	Hacke Mandy,Gruber Tobias,Schulenburg Cindy,Balbach Jochen,Arnold Ulrich	The FEBS journal. 280(18) 4454-62	Onconase	QDWLTFQKKHITNTRDVDCDNIMSTNLFHCKDKNTFIYSRPEPVKAICKGIIASKNVLTTSEFYLSDCNVTSRPCKYKLKKSTNKFCVTCENQAPVHFVGVGSC		P22069	Endonuclease	full length	4.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	t	f	f

Onconase, an unusually stable ribonuclease A homologue from the Northern leopard frog, contains four trans proline residues in its native state. During the refolding from its guanidine hydrochloride unfolded state, which includes the formation of a folding intermediate, the slowest of the three phases has earlier been attributed to a cis-to-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerization reaction. We thus substituted all four proline residues individually by alanine and investigated the effect of the amino acid substitutions on the folding and stability of the onconase variants. All onconase variants proved to adopt a tertiary structure comparable with that of the wild-type protein. Although the slow phase was not eliminated for any of the variants, the P43A substitution resulted in an increase in the rate constant of the fast folding phase, i.e. a faster formation of the folding intermediate. This variant also exhibits a significant increase in thermodynamic stability. As residue 43 belongs to those residues that are protected from hydrogen exchange with the solvent in the folding intermediate, the increase in the rate constant and stability of the P43A variant emphasizes the importance of the intermediate for the folding of onconase.	2013 Sep	Hacke Mandy,Gruber Tobias,Schulenburg Cindy,Balbach Jochen,Arnold Ulrich	The FEBS journal. 280(18) 4454-62	Onconase	QDWLTFQKKHITNTRDVDCDNIMSTNLFHCKDKNTFIYSRPEAVKAICKGIIASKNVLTTSEFYLSDCNVTSRPCKYKLKKSTNKFCVTCENQAPVHFVGVGSC	P43A mutant	P22069	Endonuclease	full length	4.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	t	f	f

23797330	Heterologous expression, characterization and evaluation of the matrix protein from Newcastle disease virus as a target for antiviral therapies.	Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is an infectious agent of a large variety of birds, including chicken, which poses a real threat to the agriculture industry. Matrix (M) proteins of NDV and many other viruses perform critical functions during viral assembly and budding from the host cell. M-proteins are well conserved and therefore are potential targets for antiviral therapies. To validate this, we expressed the NDV M-protein in its native form in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. Proper refolding of the recombinant protein produced in E. coli was verified using circular dichroism and infrared spectroscopies and electron microscopy. Immunization of chickens with the NDV M-protein elicited significant serum antibody titers. However, the antibodies conferred little protection against the ND following lethal viral challenges. We conclude that the M-protein is not exposed on the surface of the host cell or the virus at any stage during its life cycle. We discuss how the conserved M-protein can further be exploited as an antiviral drug target.	2014 Mar	Iram Nida,Shah Muhammad Salahuddin,Ismat Fouzia,Habib Mudasser,Iqbal Mazhar,Hasnain S Samar,Rahman Moazur	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 98(4) 1691-701	Matrix protein	MDSSRTIGLYFDSALPSSNLLAFPIVLQDIGDGKKQIAPQYRIQRLDSWTDSKEDSVFITTYGFIFQVGNEEVTVGMISDNPKHELLSAAMLCLGSVPNVGDLVELARACLTMVVTCKKSATDTERMVFSVVQAPQVLQSCRVVANKYSSVNAVKHVKAPEKIPGSGTLEYKVNFVSLTVVPRKDVYKIPTAALKVSGSSLYNLALNVTIDVEVDPKSPLVKSLSKSDSGYYANLFLHIGLMSTVDKKGKKVTFDKLERKIRRLDLSVGLSDVLGPSVLVKARGARTRLLAPFFSSSGTACYPISNASPQVAKILWSQTARLRSVKVIIQAGTQRAVAVTADHEVTSTKIEKRHTIAKYNPFKK	C-terminal MBP-His8 fusion protein	P11206	viral protein	full length	7.9	room temperature	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
23827208	Expression and characterization of an enantioselective antigen-binding fragment directed against α-amino acids.	This work describes the design and expression of a stereoselective Fab that possesses binding properties comparable to those displayed by the parent monoclonal antibody. Utilizing mRNA from hybridoma clones that secrete a stereoselective anti-l-amino acid antibody, a corresponding biotechnologically produced Fab was generated. For that, appropriate primers were designed based on extensive literature and databank searches. Using these primers in PCR resulted in successful amplification of the VH, VL, CL and CH1 gene fragments. Overlap PCR was utilized to combine the VH and CH1 sequences and the VL and CL sequences, respectively, to obtain the genes encoding the HC and LC fragments. These sequences were separately cloned into the pEXP5-CT/TOPO expression vector and used for transfection of BL21(DE3) cells.

23827311	Expression, purification, and evaluation of recombinant LecA as a candidate for an amebic colitis vaccine.	Entamoeba histolytica, which causes amebic colitis and liver abscess, is considered a major enteric pathogen in residents and travelers to developing countries where the disease is endemic. Interaction of this protozoan parasite with the intestine is mediated through the binding of the trophozoite stage to intestinal mucin and epithelium via a galactose and N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (Gal/GalNAc) lectin comprised of a disulfide linked heavy (ca. 180 kDa) and light chain (ca. 35 kDa) and a noncovalently bound intermediate subunit (ca. 150 kDa). Our efforts to develop a vaccine against this pathogen have focused on an internal 578 amino acid fragment, designated LecA, located within the cysteine-rich region of the heavy chain subunit because: (i) it is a major target of adherence-blocking antibodies of seropositive individuals and (ii) vaccination with his-tagged LecA provides protection in animal models. We developed a purification process for preparing highly purified non-tagged LecA using a codon-optimized gene expressed in Escherichia coli. The process consisted of: (i) cell lysis, collection and washing of inclusion bodies; (ii) solubilization and refolding of denatured LecA; and (iii) a polishing gel filtration step. The purified fragment existed primarily as a random coil with β-sheet structure, contained low endotoxin and nucleic acid, was highly immunoreactive, and elicited antibodies that recognized native lectin and that inhibited in vitro adherence of trophozoites to CHO cells. Immunization of CBA mice with LecA resulted in significant protection against cecal colitis. Our procedure yields sufficient amounts of highly purified LecA for future studies on stability, immunogenicity, and protection with protein-adjuvant formulations.	2014 Feb	Barroso L,Abhyankar M,Noor Z,Read K,Pedersen K,White R,Fox C,Petri W A,Lyerly D	Vaccine. 32(10) 1218-24	LecA	SGMKVCGKVNGNCRCDASTSYQCKCDTSNGCTNGEVCDYTDGDPKCINVDNCEELKGHDIVWEGCYKKVCKEYTANGTTQYVVDQEEYVCKEKVPEKCDGYANYVCSGNRECILVTTDKAIQECKICDGNEIVNKCEGLTTSQGIPFVCKDGECQAPDEYDCKDLFKDRLSDCEQYYEWEYANGECKVIVKDGSKVILDSQCMYCSYDNILVDPAKLIKMDCTNKKNINGIPYVCRDGSCHIDDEFDCTKHENFPSKCLDVLDYKLIIGTTFDEYKCEWNSNEEKVKSLCKYCSGMDKESTLVDKCPNQVDASGNIYQMTCSDGDCKYEGDCNPTNNCFIQVKTGTSQLCEPTNVTICPSLPPSKPGEVICMKTNCDASGSIPKCSGVYDDSICSSNTADVGCASLTGKCDTSTGYCIKKEFTKCSDEPSNDRDCTDKCYNYTCVETITEGVITHKWTSNIDGHEKALLYKNKCQDA	aa 578–1154 of heavy subunit	C4M7A1			8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f	f
23871287	Autoprotease N(pro): analysis of self-cleaving fusion protein.	A reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography method was developed for determination of in vitro refolding and cleavage kinetics for the N(pro) autoprotease fusion peptide EDDIE-pep6His using a TSK Super-Octyl column with a segmented acetonitrile gradient. Self-cleaving fusion proteins such as N(pro) autoprotease fusion proteins consist of the single autoprotease N(pro) and a target peptide or a target protein as fusion partner. Hence, three protein species are present after self-cleavage: the target peptide or protein, the single N(pro) autoprotease and, in case of incomplete cleavage, residual N(pro) fusion protein. Thus, for an accurate analysis the method must be standardized for three components in the presence of host cell impurities. For method validation, protein standards of EDDIE-pep6His and the single N(pro) autoprotease EDDIE were prepared from inclusion bodies (IBs) by ion exchange, immobilized metal ion affinity, size exclusion, and reversed phase chromatography. A linear correlation was obtained for EDDIE-pep6His and EDDIE in the range from 95 to 730μg/ml with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) and a lower limit of detection (LLOD) of 34.5 and 11.4μg/ml, respectively, for EDDIE-pep6His and 39.6 and 13.1μg/ml, respectively, for EDDIE. Finally, a fully automated batch refolding of EDDIE-pep6His from IBs was performed to demonstrate the applicability of this method. It was shown that the initial EDDIE-pep6His concentration in the refolding solution decreased from 194.3 to 83.8μg/ml over a refolding time of 385min resulting in a final refolding and cleavage yield of 50%.	2013 Aug	Wellhoefer Martin,Sprinzl Wolfgang,Hahn Rainer,Jungbauer Alois	Journal of chromatography.

23872484	Studies on the expression and processing of human proinsulin derivatives encoded by different DNA constructs.	A synthetic gene encoding human proinsulin, containing Escherichia coli preferred codons, with an additional N-terminal methionine, was used for the expression, of M-proinsulin and construction of nine derivatives. No improvement in expression was noted, relative to that of M-proinsulin, when the 5&#39;- of the gene was appended to codons for seven amino acids of a well expressed E. coli protein (threonine dehydrogenase), or the constructs contained multiple copies of the proinsulin gene. That in the latter constructs only the gene adjacent to the prometer sequence is expressed, was shown by a construct containing a proinsulin gene followed by that for interferon α-2b. With the latter construct, the proinsulin was, predominantly, expressed. The availability of data on the constructs prompted, subjecting these to analysis by two models designed to predict the expression of proteins from the sequences, of putative mRNA, around the start of translation but no significant relationship was noted. In all cases the proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies, which were refolded to give products of desired masses and successfully converted into insulin derivatives. Of all the constructs containing a trypsin sensitive site before phenylalanine (F), the N-terminal sequence, MKR↓F, was most efficiently processed, by a cocktail of trypsin and buffalo carboxypeptidase B, to give insulin with the removal of the N-terminus linker as well as the C-peptide in a single step, without cleaving the trypsin sensitive K(29)T(30) peptide bond.	2013 Sep	Aslam Farheen,Gardner Qurra-tul Ann Afza,Zain Hina,Nadeem Muhammad Shahid,Ali Muhammad,Rashid Naeem,Akhtar Muhammad	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1834(10) 2116-23	human synthetic M-proinsulin	MFVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKTRREAEDLQVGQVELGGGPGAGSLQPLALEGSLQKRGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN					9.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
23891837	Expression and chaperone-assisted refolding of a new cold-active lipase from Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5(T).	We describe cloning and expression of genes coding for lipase Lip2Pc and lipase-specific foldase LifPc from a psychrotrophic microorganism Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5(T) isolated from a Siberian cryopeg (the lense of overcooled brine within permafrost). Upon expression in Escherichiacoli Lip2Pc accumulated in inclusion bodies while chaperone was synthesized in a soluble form. An efficient protocol for solubilization and subsequent refolding of the recombinant lipase in the presence of the truncated chaperone was developed. Using this procedure Lip2Pc with specific activity of 6900U/mg was obtained. Contrary to published data on other lipase-chaperone complexes, refolded Lip2Pc was mostly recovered from the complex with chaperone by metal-affinity chromatography. Recombinant Lip2Pc displayed maximum lipolytic activity at 25°C and pH 8.0 with p-nitrophenyl palmitate (C16) as a substrate. Activity assays conducted at different temperatures revealed that the recombinant Lip2Pc is a cold-adapted lipase with ability to utilize substrates with long (C10-C16) hydrocarbon chains in the temperature range from +5 to +65°C. It demonstrated relatively high stability at temperatures above 60°C and in the presence of various metal ions or organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, etc.). Non-ionic detergents, such as Triton X-100 and Tween 20 decreased Lip2Pc activity and SDS completely inhibited it.	2013 Aug	Novototskaya-Vlasova Ksenia,Petrovskaya Lada,Kryukova Elena,Rivkina Elizaveta,Dolgikh Dmitry,Kirpichnikov Mikhail	Protein expression and purification. 91(1) 96-103	Lip2Pc	MAGQYYNCANADGCQLVSSQYFTSDHTKTKYPVVLAHGMAGFTKMFGLVDYFYGIPETLMSGGSQVYTTKTSSFNNSEIRGEQLLQKIKTISAISGSPKVNLLGHSQGGIDIRYVAGVAPEYVASVTAIGSPEQGSKTADAVMQTLSEDSLATQAVSVFFQLFGGVTDVGSGTSPTELNKQEAWNTAVALSTDGAAKFNAKFPAAMPTSYCGQPTGTEANGIKYYSFSGVGQITNGLDPSDYMLALTGTSFDNDPNDGLVSACSSRLGYVIRDDYRMNHLDSANQLLGLTAWGQPDPKTLYRDQVNRLKKA		Q1QDM7	Hydrolase	full-length (Met+41-351, without signal (1-40))	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
23894676	Refolding of a thermostable glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase for application in synthetic cascade biomanufacturing.	The production of chemicals from renewable resources is gaining importance in the light of limited fossil resources. One promising alternative to widespread fermentation based methods used here is Synthetic Cascade Biomanufacturing, the application of minimized biocatalytic reaction cascades in cell free processes. One recent example is the development of the phosphorylation independent conversion of glucose to ethanol and isobutanol using only 6 and 8 enzymes, respectively. A key enzyme for this pathway is aldehyde dehydrogenase from Thermoplasma acidophilum, which catalyzes the highly substrate specific oxidation of d-glyceraldehyde to d-glycerate. In this work the enzyme was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Using matrix-assisted refolding of inclusion bodies the yield of enzyme production was enhanced 43-fold and thus for the first time the enzyme was provided in substantial amounts. Characterization of structural stability verified correct refolding of the protein. The stability of the enzyme was determined by guanidinium chloride as well as isobutanol induced denaturation to be ca. -8 kJ/mol both at 25°C and 40°C. The aldehyde dehydrogenase is active at high temperatures and in the presence of small amounts of organic solvents. In contrast to previous publications, the enzyme was found to accept NAD(+) as cofactor making it suitable for application in the artificial glycolysis.	2013 Jul	Steffler Fabian,Sieber Volker	PloS one. 8(7) e70592	Glyceraldehyde Dehydrogenase (TaAlDH)	MDTKLYIDGQWVNSSSGKTVDKYSPVTGQVIGRFEAATRDDVDRAIDAAEDAFWAWNDLGSVERSKIIYRAKELIEKNRAELENIIMEENGKPVKEAKEEVDGVIDQIQYYAEWARKLNGEVVEGTSSHRKIFQYKVPYGIVVALTPWNFPAGMVARKLAPALLTGNTVVLKPSSDTPGSAEWIVRKFVEAGVPKGVLNFITGRGSEIGDYIVEHKKVNLITMTGSTATGQRIMQKASANMAKLILELGGKAPFMVWKDADMDNALKTLLWAKYWNAGQSCIAAERLYVHEDIYDTFMSRFVELSRKLALGDPKNADMGPLINKGALQATSEIVEEAKESGAKILFGGSQPSLSGPYRNGYFFLPTIIGNADQKSKIFQEEIFAPVIGARKISSVEEMYDLANDSKYGLASYLFTKDPNIIFEASERIRFGELYVNMPGPEASQGYHTGFRMTGQAGEGSKYGISEYLKLKNIYVDYSGKPLHINTVRDDLFQ		Q9HK01	aldehyde dehydrogenase	full length	8	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f
23904284	Nonuniform chain collapse during early stages of staphylococcal nuclease folding detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and ultrarapid mixing methods.	The development of tertiary structure during folding of staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) was studied by time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer measured using continuous- and stopped-flow techniques. Variants of this two-domain protein containing intradomain and interdomain fluorescence donor/acceptor pairs (Trp and Cys-linked fluorophore or quencher) were prepared to probe the intradomain and interdomain structural evolution accompanying SNase folding. The intra-domain donor/acceptor pairs are within the β-barrel domain (Trp27/Cys64 and Trp27/Cys97) and the interdomain pair is between the α-helical domain and the β-barrel domain (Trp140/Cys64). Time-resolved energy transfer efficiency accompanying folding and unfolding at different urea concentrations was measured over a time range from 30 μs to ≈ 10 s. Information on average donor/acceptor distances at different stages of the folding process was obtained by using a quantitative kinetic modeling approach. The average distance for the donor/acceptor pairs in the β-barrel domain decreases to nearly native values whereas that of the interdomain donor/acceptor pairs remains unchanged in the earliest intermediate (&lt;500 μs of refolding). This indicates a rapid nonuniform collapse resulting in an ensemble of heterogeneous conformations in which the central region of the β-barrel domain is well developed while the C-terminal α-helical domain remains disordered. The distance between Trp140 and Cys64 decreases to native values on the 100-ms time scale, indicating that the α-helical domain docks onto the preformed β-barrel at a late stage of the folding. In addition, the unfolded state is found to be more compact under native conditions, suggesting that changes in solvent conditions may induce a nonspecific hydrophobic collapse.	2013 Sep	Mizukami Takuya,Xu Ming,Cheng Hong,Roder Heinrich,Maki Kosuke	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 22(10) 1336-48	Staphylococcal nuclease (SNase)	ATSTKKLHKEPATLIKAIDGDTVKLMYKGQPMTFRLLLVDTPETKHPKKGVEKYGPEASAFTKKMVENAKKIEVEFDKGQRTDKYGRGLAYIYADGKMVNEALVRQGLAKVAYVYKPNNTHEQHLRKSEAQAKKEKLNIWSEDNADSGQ	83-231	P00644	DNA nuclease, RNA nuclease		5.2	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
23919120	Cloning and Expression of Functional Reteplase in Escherichia coli TOP10.	BACKGROUND:Production of tissue Plasminogen Activator protein (t-PA) in prokaryotes systems has many problems such as the lack of active protein production, multiple purification steps, and renaturation process which has been shown to be costly and time-consuming.METHODS:In this study, reteplase which is the nonglycosylated active domain of t-PA was used to transform TOP10 Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria to resolve some of the above mentioned problems. Reteplase cDNA was ligated into pBAD/gIII plasmid which allowed secretion of this protein into the periplasmic space and would allow the correct formation of disulfide bonds in protein structure. The presence of reteplase cDNA in pBAD/gIII plasmid was confirmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. After induction of the expression of this protein by adding 0.0002% L-Arabinose to the medium, the proteins in periplasmic space as well as the inclusion bodies formed inside the cell were extracted. Subsequently, these proteins were purified and detected by Western blot method.RESULTS:Our results showed that the amount of reteplase extracted from periplasmic space was much lower than the extracted inclusion bodies and large quantities of the recombinant protein were present as inclusion bodies. Therefore, it was more efficient to use inclusion body extraction method for protein isolation and purification.CONCLUSION:We produced active reteplase after its expression in E. coli TOP10 and isolation of inclusion bodies produced the best results for purification and extraction of this protein.	2013 Aug	Khodabakhsh Fatemeh,Dehghani Zohreh,Zia Mohammad Farid,Rabbani Mohammad,Sadeghi Hamid Mir Mohammad	Avicenna journal of medical biotechnology. 5(3) 168-75	Reteplase	MDAMKRGLCCVLLLCGAVFVSPSQEIHARFRRGARSYQVICRDEKTQMIYQQHQSWLRPVLRSNRVEYCWCNSGRAQCHSVPVKSCSEPRCFNGGTCQQALYFSDFVCQCPEGFAGKCCEIDTRATCYEDQGISYRGTWSTAESGAECTNWNSSALAQKPYSGRRPDAIRLGLGNHNYCRNPDRDSKPWCYVFKAGKYSSEFCSTPACSEGNSDCYFGNGSAYRGTHSLTESGASCLPWNSMILIGKVYTAQNPSAQALGLGKHNYCRNPDGDAKPWCHVLKNRRLTWEYCDVPSCSTCGLRQYSQPQFRIKGGLFADIASHPWQAAIFAKHRRSPGERFLCGGILISSCWILSAAHCFQERFPPHHLTVILGRTYRVVPGEEEQKFEVEKYIVHKEFDDDTYDNDIALLQLKSDSSRCAQESSVVRTVCLPPADLQLPDWTECELSGYGKHEALSPFYSERLKEAHVRLYPSSRCTSQHLLNRTVTDNMLCAGDTRSGGPQANLHDACQGDSGGPLVCLNDGRMTLVGIISWGLGCGQKDVPGVYTKVTNYLDWIRDNMRP	amino acid 1 to 3 and 176 to 527	P00750	destruction of blood clot through the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin	Kringle 2 domain plus the first three amino acids	10.5	20	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
23936256	Recombinant prion protein refolded with lipid and RNA has the biochemical hallmarks of a prion but lacks in vivo infectivity.	During prion infection, the normal, protease-sensitive conformation of prion protein (PrP(C)) is converted via seeded polymerization to an abnormal, infectious conformation with greatly increased protease-resistance (PrP(Sc)). In vitro, protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) uses PrP(Sc) in prion-infected brain homogenates as an initiating seed to convert PrP(C) and trigger the self-propagation of PrP(Sc) over many cycles of amplification. While PMCA reactions produce high levels of protease-resistant PrP, the infectious titer is often lower than that of brain-derived PrP(Sc). More recently, PMCA techniques using bacterially derived recombinant PrP (rPrP) in the presence of lipid and RNA but in the absence of any starting PrP(Sc) seed have been used to generate infectious prions that cause disease in wild-type mice with relatively short incubation times. These data suggest that lipid and/or RNA act as cofactors to facilitate the de novo formation of high levels of prion infectivity. Using rPrP purified by two different techniques, we generated a self-propagating protease-resistant rPrP molecule that, regardless of the amount of RNA and lipid used, had a molecular mass, protease resistance and insolubility similar to that of PrP(Sc). However, we were unable to detect prion infectivity in any of our reactions using either cell-culture or animal bioassays. These results demonstrate that the ability to self-propagate into a protease-resistant insoluble conformer is not unique to infectious PrP molecules. They suggest that the presence of RNA and lipid cofactors may facilitate the spontaneous refolding of PrP into an infectious form while also allowing the de novo formation of self-propagating, but non-infectious, rPrP-res.	2013 Aug	Timmes Andrew G,Moore Roger A,Fischer Elizabeth R,Priola Suzette A	PloS one. 8(7) e71081	Prion Protein	MANLGYWLLALFVTMWTDVGLCKKRPKPGGWNTGGSRYPGQGSPGGNRYPPQGGTWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGSWGQPHGGSWGQPHGGGWGQGGGTHNQWNKPSKPKTNLKHVAGAAAAGAVVGGLGGYMLGSAMSRPMIHFGNDWEDRYYRENMYRYPNQVYYRPVDQYSNQNNFVHDCVNITIKQHTVTTTTKGENFTETDVKMMERVVEQMCVTQYQKESQAYYDGRRSSSTVLFSSPPVILLISFLIFLIVG		P04925	neuronal development and synaptic plasticity	23-230	8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
23969156	Construction and immunological evaluation of truncated hepatitis B core particles carrying HBsAg amino acids 119-152 in the major immunodominant region (MIR).	Hepatitis B capsid protein expressed in Escherichia coli can reassemble into icosahedral particles, which could strongly enhance the immunogenicity of foreign epitopes, especially those inserted into its major immunodominant region. Herein, we inserted the entire &#39;α&#39; antigenic determinant amino acids (aa) 119-152 of HBsAg into the truncated HBc (aa 1-144), between Asp(78) and Pro(79). Prokaryotic expression showed that the mosaic HBc was mainly in the form of inclusion bodies. After denaturation with urea, it was dialyzed progressively for protein renaturation. We observed that before and after renaturation, mosaic HBc was antigenic as determined by HBsAg ELISA and a lot of viruslike particles were observed after renaturation. Thus, we further purified the mosaic viruslike particles by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, DEAE chromatography, and Sepharose 4FF chromatography. Negative staining electron microscopy demonstrated the morphology of the viruslike particles. Immunization of Balb/c mice with mosaic particles induced the production of anti-HBs antibody and Th1 cell immune response supported by ELISPOT and CD4/CD8 proportions assay. In conclusion, we constructed mosaic hepatitis core particles displaying the entire &#39;α&#39; antigenic determinant on the surface and laid a foundation for researching therapeutic hepatits B vaccines.	2013 Sep	Su Qiudong,Yi Yao,Guo Minzhuo,Qiu Feng,Jia Zhiyuan,Lu Xuexin,Meng Qingling,Bi Shengli	Biochemical and biophysical research communications. 439(1) 84-9	mosaic HBc						8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
23973337	Heterologous expression and purification of biologically active domains 3 and 4 of human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor and its interaction with choline binding protein A of Streptococcus pneumoniae.	Streptococcus pneumoniae, one of the common causes of pneumonia, colonises the epithelium via the interaction between a choline binding protein of S. pneumoniae and the human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR). One of the functions of pIgR is to mediate the transcytosis of polymeric immunoglobulins from the basolateral to the apical surface of epithelial cells. S. pneumoniae invades human epithelial cells by exploiting the transcytosis machinery. Due to an increase in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, and the limitations and expense of the vaccines available, extensive research may provide insights into the potential of new therapeutic regimes. This study investigated the potential of pIgR domains as an alternative non-antibiotic immune therapy for treating pneumonia. The aim was to determine the binding affinity of recombinant D3D4 protein, the domains of pIgR responsible for binding S. pneumoniae, to recombinant R1R2 repeat domains of choline binding protein A of S. pneumoniae. Biologically active recombinant D3D4 was produced in Escherichia coli using a gel filtration chromatography refolding method, a novel approach for the refolding of pIgR domains, after the purification of inclusion bodies using nickel affinity chromatography. Surface Plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy showed that purified recombinant D3D4 binds recombinant R1R2 with an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of 3.36×10(-7)M.	2013 Sep	Venables Luanne,Govender Sharlene,Oosthuizen Vaughan	Protein expression and purification. 91(2) 207-14	human polymeric immunoglobulin receptor	KPEPELVYEDLRGSVTFHCALGPEVANVAKFLCRQSSGENCDVVVNTLGKRAPAFEGRILLNPQDKDGSFSVVITGLRKEDAGRYLCGAHSDGQLQEGSPIQAWQLFVNEESTIPRSPTVVKGVAGGSVAVLCPYNRKESKSIKYWCLWEGAQNGRCPLLVDSEGWVKAQYEGRLSLLEEPGNGTFTVILNQLTSRDAGFYWCLTNGDTLWRTTVEIKIIEGEPN		P01833	Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor			4	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
23975279	Refolding of laccase in dilution additive mode with copper-based ionic liquid.	Ionic liquids (ILs) are molten salts which do not crystallize at room temperature. Tunable physicochemical properties of ILs including hydrophobicity and polarity facilitate their applications in many biological processes. In this study, a copper-based IL was employed in order to enhance the refolding efficiency of laccase from Trametes versicolor which requires copper as a cofactor. When 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium trichlorocuprate ([EMIM][CuCl₃]) was added to refolding buffer instead of urea, the laccase refolding yield was improved more than 2.7 times compared to the conventional refolding buffer which contains urea. When the refolding of laccase was carried out at different temperatures (4, 25, and 37 °C), the highest refolding yield was obtained at 25 °C. At low temperature, two conflicting effects, i.e., suppression of the aggregate formation and decrease of folding rate, influence the protein refolding. In contrast, a copper-based IL did not enhance the refolding of lysozyme, a non-copper-containing protein. From these results, we can conclude that this copper-based IL, [EMIM][CuCl₃], was exclusively effective on the refolding process of a copper-containing protein.	2013 Oct	Bae Sang-Woo,Ahn Kihun,Koo Yoon-Mo,Ha Sung Ho	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 171(5) 1289-98	laccase	MGLQRFSFFV TLALVARSLA AIGPVASLVV ANAPVSPDGF LRDAIVVNGV VPSPLITGKK GDRFQLNVVD TLTNHSMLKS TSIHWHGFFQ AGTNWADGPA FVNQCPIASG HSFLYDFHVP DQAGTFWYHS HLSTQYCDGL RGPFVVYDPK DPHASRYDVD NESTVITLTD WYHTAARLGP RFPLGADATL INGLGRSAST PTAALAVINV QHGKRYRFRL VSISCDPNYT FSIDGHNLTVIEVDGINSQP LLVDSIQIFA AQRYSFVLNA NQTVGNYWVR ANPNFGTVGF AGGINSAILR  YQGAPVAEPT TTQTPSVIPL IETNLHPLAR MPVPGSPTPG GVDKALNLAF NFNGTNFFID NASFTPPTVP VLLQILSGAQ TAQELLPAGS VYPLPAHSTI EITLPATALA PGAPHPFHLH GHAFAVVRSA GSTTYNYNDP IFRDVVSTGT PAAGDNVTIR FQTDNPGPWF LHCHIDFHLE AGFAIVFAED VADVKAANPV PKAWSDLCPI YDGLSEANQ		Q5IR80	Oxidoreductase		5.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

23990324	Interdomain contacts control folding of transcription factor RfaH.	Escherichia coli RfaH activates gene expression by tethering the elongating RNA polymerase to the ribosome. This bridging action requires a complete refolding of the RfaH C-terminal domain (CTD) from an α-helical hairpin, which binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) in the free protein, to a β-barrel, which interacts with the ribosomal protein S10 following RfaH recruitment to its target operons. The CTD forms a β-barrel when expressed alone or proteolytically separated from the NTD, indicating that the α-helical state is trapped by the NTD, perhaps co-translationally. Alternatively, the interdomain contacts may be sufficient to drive the formation of the α-helical form. Here, we use functional and NMR analyses to show that the denatured RfaH refolds into the native state and that RfaH in which the order of the domains is reversed is fully functional in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that all information necessary to determine its fold is encoded within RfaH itself, whereas accessory factors or sequential folding of NTD and CTD during translation are dispensable. These findings suggest that universally conserved RfaH homologs may change folds to accommodate diverse interaction partners and that context-dependent protein refolding may be widespread in nature.	2013 Dec	Tomar Sushil Kumar,Knauer Stefan H,Nandymazumdar Monali,Rösch Paul,Artsimovitch Irina	Nucleic acids research. 41(22) 10077-85	RfaH	MQSWYLLYCKRGQLQRAQEHLERQAVNCLAPMITLEKIVRGKRTAVSEPLFPNYLFVEFDPEVIHTTTINATRGVSHFVRFGASPAIVPSAVIHQLSVYKPKDIVDPATPYPGDKVIITEGAFEGFQAIFTEPDGEARSMLLLNLINKEIKHSVKNTEFRKL	This sequence is from Escherichia coli K-12.

24084635	Refolding of the recombinant protein Sm29, a step toward the production of the vaccine candidate against schistosomiasis.	Schistosomiasis is an important parasitic disease, with about 240 million people infected worldwide. Humans and animals can be infected, imposing an enormous social and economic burden. The only drug available for chemotherapy, praziquantel, does not control reinfections, and an efficient vaccine for prophylaxis is still missing. However, the tegumental protein Sm29 of Schistosoma mansoni was shown to be a promising antigen to compose an anti-schistosomiasis vaccine. Though, recombinant Sm29 is expressed in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies requiring an efficient process of refolding, thus, hampering its production in large scale. We present in this work studies to refold the recombinant Sm29 using high hydrostatic pressure, a mild condition to dissociate aggregated proteins, leading to refolding on a soluble conformation. Our studies resulted in high yield of rSm29 (73%) as a stably soluble and structured protein. The refolded antigen presented protective effect against S. mansoni development in immunized mice. We concluded that the refolding process by application of high hydrostatic pressure succeeded, and the procedure can be scaled-up, allowing industrial production of Sm29.	2013 Dec	Chura-Chambi Rosa M,Nakajima Erika,de Carvalho Roberta R,Miyasato Patricia A,Oliveira Sergio C,Morganti Ligia,Martins Elizabeth A L	Journal of biotechnology. 168(4) 511-9	Sm29	MKSGWEYIGIFLYIMVNILDKQRCHSVRCYVCDYCPIVTSVSISEENNCTSCSTAGYNYSIHRICVFKDGIPINFPNENRTQCNTDLCNGLTVDNTGKIPSVPIANPFRCYTCLNCTKSNQKVLSGCGACVTTRGSGIISKFCGTTCERLYIDDQISCCSTDLCNGMTKLSIHRHVIIVLFVCIGISKYIL	C-terminal 6× histidine tag	O96368	a promising antigen to compose an anti-schistosomiasis vaccine	40–169 amino acid fragment,without the signal peptide and the transmembrane domain			t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f

24086679	A strategy for synthesis of pathogenic human immunoglobulin free light chains in E. coli.	Monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains are normally synthesized in excess compared to the heavy chain partners and can be detected in serum and urine (&quot;free&quot; LC). Occasionally free LC are per se cause of organ toxicity, as in free LC-related disorders. In AL amyloidosis, the most common of these conditions, free LC with peculiar biophysical properties related to their primary structure damage target organs and organize in amyloid fibrils. Unlimited availability of well-characterized free LC is instrumental to investigate the toxic effect of these proteins and to study their interactions with targets. We present a straightforward strategy to obtain recombinant monoclonal free LC by using a bacterial system. These proteins, expressed as inclusion bodies, were subjected to solubilization and refolding procedures to recover them in native form. To minimize differences from the circulating natural LC, full-length recombinant LC were expressed, i.e. complete of variable and constant regions, with the original amino acid sequence along the entire protein, and with no purification tags. The strategy was exploited to generate free LC from three AL amyloidosis patients. After purification, recombinant proteins were biochemically characterized and compared to the natural Bence Jones protein isolated from one of the patients. Results showed that the recombinant free LC were properly folded and formed homodimers in solution, similar to the natural Bence Jones protein used for comparison. Furthermore, as proof of pathogenicity, recombinant proteins formed amyloid fibrils in vitro. We believe that the present strategy represents a valuable tool to speed research in free LC-related disorders.	2013 Oct	Rognoni Paola,Lavatelli Francesca,Casarini Simona,Palladini Giovanni,Verga Laura,Pedrazzoli Paolo,Valentini Giovanna,Merlini Giampaolo,Perfetti Vittorio	PloS one. 8(9) e76022	Human immunoglobulin light chains					full-length	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
24115021	Increase in activation rate of Pro-Tk-subtilisin by a single nonpolar-to-polar amino acid substitution at the hydrophobic core of the propeptide domain.	Tk-subtilisin (Gly70-Gly398) is a subtilisin homolog from Thermococcus kodakarensis. Active Tk-subtilisin is produced from its inactive precursor, Pro-Tk-subtilisin (Gly1-Gly398), by autoprocessing and degradation of the propeptide (Tk-propeptide, Gly1-Leu69). This activation process is extremely slow at moderate temperatures owing to high stability of Tk-propeptide. Tk-propeptide is stabilized by the hydrophobic core. To examine whether a single nonpolar-to-polar amino acid substitution at this core affects the activation rate of Pro-Tk-subtilisin, the Pro-Tk-subtilisin derivative with the Phe17 → His mutation (Pro-F17H), Tk-propeptide derivative with the same mutation (F17H-propeptide), and two active-site mutants of Pro-F17H (Pro-F17H/S324A and Pro-F17H/S324C) were constructed. The crystal structure of Pro-F17H/S324A was nearly identical to that of Pro-S324A, indicating that the mutation does not affect the structure of Pro-Tk-subtilisin. The refolding rate of Pro-F17H/S324A and autoprocessing rate of Pro-F17H/S324C were also nearly identical to those of their parent proteins (Pro-S324A and Pro-S324C). However, the activation rate of Pro-F17H greatly increased when compared with that of Pro-Tk-subtilisin, such that Pro-F17H is efficiently activated even at 40°C. The far-UV circular dichroism spectrum of F17H-propeptide did not exhibit a broad trough at 205-230 nm, which is observed in the spectrum of Tk-propeptide. F17H-propeptide is more susceptible to chymotryptic degradation than Tk-propeptide. These results suggest that F17H-propeptide is unfolded in an isolated form and is therefore rapidly degraded by Tk-subtilisin. Thus, destabilization of the hydrophobic core of Tk-propeptide by a nonpolar-to-polar amino acid substitution is an effective way to increase the activation rate of Pro-Tk-subtilisin.	2013 Nov	Yuzaki Kota,Sanda Yudai,You Dong-Ju,Uehara Ryo,Koga Yuichi,Kanaya Shigenori	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 22(12) 1711-21	Tk-subtilisin	GEQNTIRVIVSVDKAKFNPHEVLGIGGHIVYQFKLIPAVVVDVPANAVGKLKKMPGVEKVEFDHQAVLLGKPSWLGGGSTQPAQTIPWGIERVKAPSVWSITDGSVSVIQVAVLDTGVDYDHPDLAANIAWCVSTLRGKVSTKLRDCADQNGHGTHVIGTIAALNNDIGVVGVAPGVQIYSVRVLDARGSGSYSDIAIGIEQAILGPDGVADKDGDGIIAGDPDDDAAEVISMSLGGPADDSYLYDMIIQAYNAGIVIVAASGNEGAPSPSYPAAYPEVIAVGAIDSNDNIASFSNRQPEVSAPGVDILSTYPDDSYETLMGTSMATPHVSGVVALIQAAYYQKYGKILPVGTFDDISKNTVRGILHITADDLGPTGWDADYGYGVVRAALAVQAALG	F17H/S324C mutant	P58502	serine protease	full-length	7.0	30	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	t

24121327	Crystal structure analysis, overexpression and refolding behaviour of a DING protein with single mutation.	After crystallization of a certain protein-RNA complex, well diffracting crystals were obtained. However, the asymmetric unit of the crystal was too small to locate any components. Mass spectrometry and X-ray crystal structure analysis showed that it was a member of the DING protein family (HPBP). Surprisingly, the structure of HPBP reported previously was also determined accidentally as a contaminant, suggesting that HPBP has a strong tendency to crystallize. Furthermore, DING proteins were reported to relate in disease. These observations suggest that DING has potential for application in a wide range of research fields. To enable further analyses, a system for preparation of HPBP was constructed. As HPBP was expressed in insoluble form in Escherichia coli, it was unfolded chemically and refolded. Finally, a very high yield preparation method was constructed, in which 43 mg of HPBP was obtained from 1 L of culture. Furthermore, to evaluate the validity of refolding, its crystal structure was determined at 1.03 Å resolution. The determined structure was identical to the native structure, in which two disulfide bonds were recovered correctly and a phosphate ion was captured. Based on these results, it was concluded that the refolded HPBP recovers its structure correctly.	2013 Oct	Gai Zuoqi,Nakamura Akiyoshi,Tanaka Yoshikazu,Hirano Nagisa,Tanaka Isao,Yao Min	Journal of synchrotron radiation. 20(Pt 6) 854-8	human phosphate-binding protein (HPBP)	DINGGGATLPQKLYLTPDVLTAGFAPYIGVGSGKGKIAFLENKYNQFGTDTTKNVHWAGSDSKLTATELATYAADKEPGWGKLIQVPSVATSVAIPFRKAGANAVDLSVKELCGVFSGRIADWSGITGAGRSGPIQVVYRAESSGTTELFTRFLNAKCTTEPGTFAVTTTFANSYSLGLTPLAGAVAATGSDGVMAALNDTTVAEGRITYISPDFAAPTLAGLDDATKVARVGKGVVNGVAVEGKSPAAANVSAAISVVPLPAAADRGNPDVWVPVFGATTGGGVVAYPDSGYPILGFTNLIFSQCYANATQTGQVRDFFTKHYGTSANNDAAIEANAFVPLPSNWKAAVRASFLTASNALSIGNTNVCNGKGRPQ	S211M mutant	P85173	DING protein	full-length	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
24137314	Recombinant expression and downstream processing of the disulfide-rich tumor-targeting peptide chlorotoxin.	Chlorotoxin (CTX) is a scorpion-derived disulfide-rich peptide that targets malignant tumors by binding the cell surface matrix metalloproteinase-2 and annexin A2. Various CTXs labeled with functional moieties have shown great potential for tumor diagnosis and treatment. In the present study, we established an efficient approach for preparing mature CTX that may be used for experimental and therapeutic purposes. The designed CTX precursors carried either a 6xHis-tag or a 6xHis-tag and a glutathione transferase (GST)-tag and were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Following S-sulfonation, the precursors were purified using immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography. Subsequent to the removal of the tag by enterokinase cleavage and in vitro oxidative refolding, mature CTX was obtained with a considerable yield. The yield of mature CTX whose precursors carried a 6xHis-tag and a GST-tag (2 mg per liter of culture) was ∼10-fold that of the mature CTX whose precursors carried a 6xHis-tag (150-200 μg per liter of culture). The folded CTX inhibited the migration of glioma cells in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting it was biologically active.	2013 Oct	Wang Xiao-Min,Luo Xiao,Guo Zhan-Yun	Experimental and therapeutic medicine. 6(4) 1049-1053	Chlorotoxin (CTX)	MHHHHHHMDDDDK MCMPCFTTDH QMARKCDDCC GGKGRGKCYG PQCLCR	N-terminal 6xHis tag	P45639	Chloride channel inhibitor	full length	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24157440	Kinetic control in protein folding for light chain amyloidosis and the differential effects of somatic mutations.	Light chain amyloidosis is a devastating disease where immunoglobulin light chains form amyloid fibrils, resulting in organ dysfunction and death. Previous studies have shown a direct correlation between the protein thermodynamic stability and the propensity for amyloid formation for some proteins involved in light chain amyloidosis. Here we investigate the effect of somatic mutations on protein stability and in vitro fibril formation of single and double restorative mutants of the protein AL-103 compared to the wild-type germline control protein. A scan rate dependence and hysteresis in the thermal unfolding and refolding was observed for all proteins. This indicates that the unfolding/refolding reaction is kinetically determined with different kinetic constants for unfolding and refolding even though the process remains experimentally reversible. Our structural analysis of AL-103 and AL-103 delP95aIns suggests a kinetic coupling of the unfolding/refolding process with cis-trans prolyl isomerization. Our data reveal that the deletion of proline 95a (AL-103 delP95aIns), which removes the trans-cis di-proline motif present in the patient protein AL-103, results in a dramatic increment in the thermodynamic stability and a significant delay in fibril formation kinetics with respect to AL-103. Fibril formation is pH dependent; all proteins form fibrils at pH2; reactions become slower and more stochastic as the pH increases up to pH7. Based on these results, we propose that, in addition to thermodynamic stability, kinetic stability (possibly influenced by the presence of cis proline 95a) plays a major role in the AL-103 amyloid fibril formation process.	2014 Jan	Blancas-Mejía Luis M,Tischer Alexander,Thompson James R,Tai Jonathan,Wang Lin,Auton Matthew,Ramirez-Alvarado Marina	Journal of molecular biology. 426(2) 347-61	AL-103	MRAKLLGIVLTTPIAISSFASTDIQMTQSPSSLSASVGDRVTITCQASQDISNYLIWYQQKPGKAPKLLIYDASNLETGVPSRFSGSGSGTDFTFTISSLQPEDIATYYCQQYHNLPPYTFGPGTKLEIK			antigen binding	full length	7.4		f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f

24174213	Cost-effective production of recombinant human interleukin 24 by lactose induction and a two-step denaturing and one-step refolding method.	Recombinant human interleukin 24 (rhIL24) is a member of the interleukin 10 (IL10) family of cytokines with novel therapeutic properties. Human IL24 possesses three N glycosylation sites and a disulfide bridge. The cost and composition of culture media is critical for commercial-scale production of recombinant proteins in E. coli. Addition of yeast extract and glucose to medium enhances rhIL24 production, and the use of lactose instead of IPTG for induction drops the cost and decreases toxicity. In addition, a two-step denaturing and one-step refolding (2DR) strategy improves rhIL24 production. The 2DR strategy replaces a more conventional approach for protein solubilization and refolding. LC-MS/MS provides definitive identification and quantitative information on rhIL24. Single-step purified rhIL24 displayed biological activity on HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but no effect on L02 cells. Proliferation analysis suggests that rhIL24 may have potential use as a medication. In the present study, we developed a simple process for producing quality product with high purity. The expression and purification of rhIL24 described here may be a step towards inexpensive large-scale production.	2014 Jan	Amirzada Muhammad Imran,Yu Minglei,Gong Xiaohai,Chen Yun,Zhu Ruiyu,Lei Jianyong,Jin Jian	Journal of industrial microbiology &amp; biotechnology. 41(1) 135-42	interleukin 24 (IL24)	MNFQQRLQSLWTLARPFCPPLLATASQMQMVVLPCLGFTLLLWSQVSGAQGQEFHFGPCQVKGVVPQKLWEAFWAVKDTMQAQDNITSARLLQQEVLQNVSDAESCYLVHTLLEFYLKTVFKNYHNRTVEVRTLKSFSTLANNFVLIVSQLQPSQENEMFSIRDSAHRRFLLFRRAFKQLDVEAALTKALGEVDILLTWMQKFYKL		Q13007	Cytokine	full length	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24206001	Formation of oligomeric cytochrome c during folding by intermolecular hydrophobic interaction between N- and C-terminal α-helices.	We have previously shown that horse cytochrome c (cyt c) forms oligomers by domain swapping its C-terminal α-helix when interacting with ethanol. Although folding of cyt c has been studied extensively, formation of domain-swapped oligomers of cyt c during folding has never been reported. We found that domain-swapped oligomeric cyt c is produced during refolding from its guanidinium ion-induced unfolded state at high protein concentrations and low temperatures. The obtained dimer exhibited a domain-swapped structure exchanging the C-terminal α-helical region between molecules. The extent of dimer formation decreased significantly for the folding of C-terminal cyt c mutants with reduced hydrophobicity achieved by replacement of hydrophobic residues with Gly in the C-terminal region, whereas a large amount of heterodimers was generated for the folding of a mixture of N- and C-terminal mutants. These results show that cyt c oligomers are formed through intermolecular hydrophobic interaction between the N- and C-terminal α-helices during folding. A slow phase (4-5 s) was observed in addition to a 400-500 ms phase during folding of a high concentration of cyt c in the presence of 1.17 M guanidine hydrochloride. The fast phase is attributed to the intramolecular ligand exchange process, and we attribute the slow phase to the ligand exchange process in oligomers. These results show that it is important to consider formation of domain-swapped oligomeric proteins when folding at high protein concentrations.	2013 Dec	Parui Partha Pratim,Deshpande Megha Subhash,Nagao Satoshi,Kamikubo Hironari,Komori Hirofumi,Higuchi Yoshiki,Kataoka Mikio,Hirota Shun	Biochemistry. 52(48) 8732-44	cytochrome c(cyt C)	GDVEKGKKIFVQKCAQCHTVEKGGKHKTGPNLHGLFGRKTGQAPGFTYTDANKNKGITWKEETLMEYLENPKKYIPGTKMIFAGIKKKTEREDLIAYLKKATNE		P00004	electron transporter, heme binding	full length	7.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t

24224041	Simplified large-scale refolding, purification, and characterization of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in Escherichia coli.	Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that stimulates the development of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells and enhances the functional activity of mature cells. Here, we report a simplified method for fed-batch culture as well as the purification of recombinant human (rh) G-CSF. The new system for rhG-CSF purification was performed using not only temperature shift strategy without isopropyl-l-thio-β-d-galactoside (IPTG) induction but also the purification method by a single step of prep-HPLC after the pH precipitation of the refolded samples. Through these processes, the final cell density and overall yield of homogenous rhG-CSF were obtained 42.8 g as dry cell weights, 1.75 g as purified active proteins, from 1 L culture broth, respectively. The purity of rhG-CSF was finally 99ince the isoforms of rhG-CSF could be separated through the prep-HPLC step. The result of biological activity indicated that purified rhG-CSF has a similar profile to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2(nd) International Standard for G-CSF. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the simple purification through a single step of prep-HPLC may be valuable for the industrial-scale production of biologically active proteins.	2013 Nov	Kim Chang Kyu,Lee Chi Ho,Lee Seung-Bae,Oh Jae-Wook	PloS one. 8(11) e80109	Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF)	MTPLGPASSLPQSFLLKCLEQVRKIQGDGAALQEKLCATYKLCHPEELVLLGHSLGIPWAPLSSCPSQALQLAGCLSQLHSGLFLYQGLLQALEGISPELGPTLDTLQLDVADFATTIWQQMEELGMAPALQPTQGAMPAFASAFQRRAGGVLVASHLQSFLEVSYRVLRHLAQP	isoform short	P09919	Cytokine	full length	8.0	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
24228881	A straightforward experimental approach to expression, purification, refolding, and enzymatic analysis of recombinant dengue virus NS2B(H)-NS3pro protease.	Dengue virus threatens around 2.5 billion people worldwide; about 50 million become infected every year, and yet no vaccine or drug is available for prevention and/or treatment. The flaviviral NS2B-NS3pro complex is indispensable for flaviviral replication and is considered to be an important drug target. The aim of this study was to develop a simple and generally applicable experimental strategy to construct, purify, and assay a highly active recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3pro complex that would be useful for high-throughput screening of potential inhibitors. The sequence of NS2B(H)-NS3pro was generated by overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) and cloned into the pTrcHisA vector. Hexahistidine-tagged NS2B(H)-NS3pro complex was expressed in E. coli predominantly as insoluble protein and purified to &gt;951fb7850urity by single-step immobilized metal affinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting of the purified enzyme demonstrated the presence of the NS2B(H)-NS3pro precursor and its autocleavage products, NS3pro and NS2B(H), as 37, 21, and 10 kDa bands, respectively. Kinetic parameters, Km, kcat, and kcat/Km for the fluorophore-linked protease model substrate Ac-nKRR-amc were obtained using inner-filter effect correction. The kinetic parameters Km, kcat, and kcat/Km for Ac-nKRR-amc substrate were 100 µM, 0.112 s(-1), and 1120 M(-1)·s(-1), respectively. A simplified procedure for the cloning, overexpression, and purification of the NS2B(H)-NS3pro complex was applied, and a highly active recombinant NS2B(H)-NS3pro complex was obtained that could be useful for the design of high-throughput assays aimed at flaviviral inhibitor discovery.	2013 Nov	Junaid M,Angsuthanasombat C,Wikberg J E S,Ali N,Katzenmeier G	Biochemistry.

24228882	Modulation of enzymatic activity of dengue virus nonstructural protein NS3 nucleoside triphosphatase/helicase by poly(U).	The nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) appears to be the most promising target for anti-flavivirus therapy because of its multiple enzymatic activities that are indispensable for virus replication. NS3 of dengue virus type 2 (DEN2) is composed of two domains, a serine protease in the N-terminal domain (NS3pro) and RNA-stimulated nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase)/RNA helicase at the C-terminus (NS3h). NS3 plays an important role in viral replication and the coordinated regulation of all the catalytic activities in the full-length NS3 protein. In this study, a plasmid harboring the NS3 helicase domain (NS3h) was constructed by PCR. The 56.5 kDa NS3h protein was purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography followed by renaturation, mediated by artificial chaperone-assisted refolding, which yielded the active helicase. NTPase activity was assayed with Malachite Green. The NTPase activity in the presence of poly(U) showed a higher turnover number (kcat) and a lower Km value than without poly(U). The activity increased approximately fourfold in the presence of polynucleotides. This indicates that NTPase activity of dengue NS3 can be stimulated by polynucleotides. A helicase assay based on internal fluorescence quenching was conducted using short internally quenched DNA oligonucleotides as substrates. Significant fluorescence signaling increase was observed in the absence of polynucleotides such as poly(U). No unwinding activity was observed with addition of poly(U). The approach we describe here is useful for the further characterization of substrate specificity and for the design of high-throughput assays aimed at discovery of inhibitors against NS3 NTPase/helicase activities.	2013 Nov	Junaid M,Angsuthanasombat C,Wikberg J E S,Ali N,Katzenmeier G	Biochemistry.

24241896	Preparation and diagnostic use of a novel recombinant single-chain antibody against rabies virus glycoprotein.	Rabies virus (RABV) causes a fatal infectious disease, but effective protection may be achieved with the use of rabies immunoglobulin and a rabies vaccine. Virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNA), which play an important role in the prevention of rabies, are commonly evaluated by the RABV neutralizing test. For determining serum VNA levels or virus titers during the RABV vaccine manufacturing process, reliability of the assay method is highly important and mainly dependent on the diagnostic antibody. Most diagnostic antibodies are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) made from hybridoma cell lines and are costly and time consuming to prepare. Thus, production of a cost-effective mAb for determining rabies VNA levels or RABV titers is needed. In this report, we describe the prokaryotic production of a RABV-specific single-chain variable fragment (scFv) protein with a His-tag (scFv98H) from a previously constructed plasmid in a bioreactor, including the purification and refolding process as well as the functional testing of the protein. The antigen-specific binding characteristics, affinity, and relative affinity of the purified protein were tested. The scFv98H antibody was compared with a commercial RABV nucleoprotein mAb for assaying the VNA level of anti-rabies serum samples from different sources or testing the growth kinetics of RABV strains for vaccine manufactured in China. The results indicated that scFv98H may be used as a novel diagnostic tool to assay VNA levels or virus titers and may be used as an alternative for the diagnostic antibody presently employed for these purposes.	2014 Feb	Yuan Ruosen,Chen Xiaoxu,Chen Yan,Gu Tiejun,Xi Hualong,Duan Ye,Sun Bo,Yu Xianghui,Jiang Chunlai,Liu Xintao,Wu Chunlai,Kong Wei,Wu Yongge	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 98(4) 1547-55	scFv98H				antibody		8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
24265768	Methionine mutations of outer membrane protein X influence structural stability and beta-barrel unfolding.	We report the biochemical and biophysical characterization of outer membrane protein X (OmpX), an eight-stranded transmembrane β-barrel from E. coli, and compare the barrel behavior with a mutant devoid of methionine residues. Transmembrane outer membrane proteins of bacterial origin are known to display high tolerance to sequence rearrangements and mutations. Our studies with the triple mutant of OmpX that is devoid of all internal methionine residues (M18L; M21L; M118L) indicate that Met replacement has no influence on the refolding efficiency and structural characteristics of the protein. Surprisingly, the conserved substitution of Met→Leu leads to barrel destabilization and causes a lowering of the unfolding free energy by a factor of ∼8.5 kJ/mol, despite the mutations occurring at the loop regions. We report that the barrel destabilization is accompanied by a loss in cooperativity of unfolding in the presence of chemical denaturants. Furthermore, we are able to detect an unfolding intermediate in the Met-less barrel, whereas the parent protein exhibits a classic two-state unfolding. Thermal denaturation measurements also suggest a greater susceptibility of the OmpX barrel to heat, in the Met-less construct. Our studies reveal that even subtle variations in the extra-membrane region of rigid barrel structures such as OmpX, may bear severe implications on barrel stability. We propose that methionines contribute to efficient barrel structuring and protein-lipid interactions, and are therefore important elements of OmpX stability.	2013 Nov	Chaturvedi Deepti,Mahalakshmi Radhakrishnan	PloS one. 8(11) e79351	outer membrane protein X	ATSTVTGGYAQSDAQGQLNKLGGFNLKYRYEEDNSPLGVIGSFTYTEKSRTASSGDYNKNQYYGITAGPAYRINDWASIYGVVGVGYGKFQTTEYPTYKHDTSDYGFSYGAGLQFNPLENVALDFSYEQSRIRSVDVGTWIAGVGYRF	M18L, M21L, M118L triplemutant	P0A917	bacterial defense system	full length	9.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f

24341776	One-step production of bioactive proteins through simultaneous PEGylation and refolding.	Production of protein therapeutics often involves in vitro refolding from bacterial inclusion bodies and subsequent PEGylation to improve protein stability and plasma half-life. Here, we devised a novel strategy for one-step production of site-specific mono-PEGylated proteins with good bioactivity and improved biostability by integrating PEGylation and protein refolding (IPPR). Using lysozyme and recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 21 (rhFGF21) as model proteins, we showed that both PEGylation and refolding of denatured proteins have been simultaneously accomplished by IPPR with high efficiency of refolding yield and bioconjugation. PEGylated rhFGF21 by IPPR has a similar capacity as the native rhFGF21 to stimulate glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells, but exhibits prolonged blood glucose and triglyceride lowering activity levels in the ob/ob diabetic mouse model. Hence, IPPR will significantly facilitate the generation of protein therapeutics.	2014 May	Niu Jianlou,Zhu Yanlin,Song Lintao,Xie Yaoyao,Zhang Yi,Wang Huiyan,Li Xiaokun,Liu Bailing,Cai Lu,Huang Zhifeng	Bioconjugate chemistry. 25(1) 63-71	ｌysozyme	KVFGRCELAAAMKRHGLDNYRGYSLGNWVCAAKFESNFNTQATNRNTDGSTDYGILQINSRWWCNDGRTPGSRNLCNIPCSALLSSDITASVNCAKKIVSDGNGMNAWVAWRNRCKGTDVQAWIRGCRL		P00698	hydrolase	full length	6.0	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

24344259	Production and stabilization of the trimeric influenza hemagglutinin stem domain for potentially broadly protective influenza vaccines.	The rapid dissemination of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus emphasizes the need for universal influenza vaccines that would broadly protect against multiple mutated strains. Recent efforts have focused on the highly conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stem domain, which must undergo a significant conformational change for effective viral infection. Although the production of isolated domains of multimeric ectodomain proteins has proven difficult, we report a method to rapidly produce the properly folded HA stem domain protein from influenza virus A/California/05/2009 (H1N1) by using Escherichia coli-based cell-free protein synthesis and a simple refolding protocol. The T4 bacteriophage fibritin foldon placed at the C terminus of the HA stem domain induces trimer formation. Placing emphasis on newly exposed protein surfaces, several hydrophobic residues were mutated, two polypeptide segments were deleted, and the number of disulfide bonds in each monomer was reduced from four to two. High pH and Brij 35 detergent emerged as the most beneficial factors for improving the refolding yield. To stabilize the trimer of the HA stem-foldon fusion, new intermolecular disulfide bonds were finally introduced between foldon monomers and between stem domain monomers. The correct immunogenic conformation of the stabilized HA stem domain trimer was confirmed by using antibodies CR6261, C179, and FI6 that block influenza infection by binding to the HA stem domain trimer. These results suggest great promise for a broadly protective vaccine and also demonstrate a unique approach for producing individual domains of complex multimeric proteins.	2014 Jan	Lu Yuan,Welsh John P,Swartz James R	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. 111(1) 125-30	hemagglutinin	MDTLCIGYHANNSTDTVDTVLEKNVTVTHSVNLLEDKHNGKLCGSGSGCNTTCQTPKGAINTSLPFQNIHPITIGKCPKYVKSTKLRLATGLRNVPSIQSRGLFGAIAGFIEGGWTGMVDGWYGYHHQNEQGSGYAADLKSTQNAIDEITNKVNSVIEKMNTQFTAVGKEFNHLEKRIENLNKKVDDGFLDIWTYNAELLVLLENERTLDYHDSNVKNLYEKVRSQLKNNAKEIGNGCFEFYHKCDNTCMESVKNGTYDYPKYSEEAKLNREEIDGVENLYFQSGSGYIPEAPRDGQAYVRKDGEWVLLSTFLGHHHHHH	C-terminul foldon domain and His6 tag	C3W5U5	hemagglutinin	stem domain (18-59, 292-520)	8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f

24344259	Production and stabilization of the trimeric influenza hemagglutinin stem domain for potentially broadly protective influenza vaccines.	The rapid dissemination of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus emphasizes the need for universal influenza vaccines that would broadly protect against multiple mutated strains. Recent efforts have focused on the highly conserved hemagglutinin (HA) stem domain, which must undergo a significant conformational change for effective viral infection.

24390866	Expression and purification of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in fed-batch culture of Escherichia coli.	Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a cytokine that has multiple roles in hematopoietic cells such as the regulation of proliferation and differentiation. Here, we describe fed-batch culture, refolding, and purification of rhG-CSF. The suitability of urea or sarcosine for solubilizing inclusion bodies (IBs) was tested. It was observed that urea is more efficient for solubilizing and refolding IBs than sarcosine is. The purity of rhG-CSF and the removal percentage of the rhG-CSF isoforms during purification were increased by pH 5.5 precipitation. The purity and the yield of purified rhG-CSF were 99% and 0.5 g of protein per liter culture broth, respectively. Our protocols of recombinant protein purification using ion exchange chromatography and semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography of pH-precipitated refolded solution may be informative to the industrial scale production of biopharmaceuticals.	2014 Mar	Kim Chang-Kyu,Choi Jun-Ha,Lee Seung-Bae,Lee Sang-Mahn,Oh Jae-Wook	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 172(5) 2425-35	Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor	ATPLGPASSLPQSFLLKCLEQVRKIQGDGAALQEKLVSECATYKLCHPEELVLLGHSLGIPWAPLSSCPSQALQLAGCLSQLHSGLFLYQGLLQALEGISPELGPTLDTLQLDVADFATTIWQQMEELGMAPALQPTQGAMPAFASAFQRRAGGVLVASHLQSFLEVSYRVLRHLAQP		P09919	Cytokine	full length	8.0	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
24397399	Matrix-assisted refolding and purification of placenta-derived recombinant human interleukin-6 produced in Escherichia coli.	Biological activity of human interleukin-6 (IL-6) is associated with a vast number of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, and severe inflammatory diseases. In this study, human IL-6 cDNA was isolated from a cDNA library that was constructed with mRNA derived from human placental tissues. Subsequently, the complete human IL-6 cDNA was cloned and expressed in BL21DE3 cells. The recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) protein was expressed in a form of an insoluble inclusion body. Inclusion bodies were solubilized under denaturing conditions and purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography with gradual on-column refolding by the gradient elution method (from 6 to 0 M urea). The protein was purified to apparent homogeneity of about 99% with a yield of 50 mg/L. The purity was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography, and Western blotting analysis. The bioactivity was assessed by proliferation assay of TF-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The present study confirms the expression of the placenta-derived IL-6 gene in a prokaryotic expression system and matrix-assisted on-column refolding and purification of rhIL-6 by immobilized metal affinity chromatography.	2014 Oct	Ahmed Nadeem,Zafar Ahmad Usman,Khan Mohsin Ahmad,Tahir Saad,Khan Muhammad Islam,Bashir Hamid,Khan Faidad,Sarwar Samreen,Ilyas Sadaf,Husnain Tayyab	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry. 61(5) 541-8	human interleukin-6	MNSFSTSAFG PVAFSLGLLL VLPAAFPAPV PPGEDSKDVA APHRQPLTSS ERIDKQIRYI LDGISALRKE TCNKSNMCES SKEALAENNL NLPKMAEKDG CFQSGFNEET CLVKIITGLL EFEVYLEYLQ NRFESSEEQA RAVQMSTKVL IQFLQKKAKN LDAITTPDPT TNASLLTKLQ AQNQWLQDMT THLILRSFKE FLQSSLRALR QM		P05231	Cytokine		8		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
24402569	High efficiency preparation and characterization of intact poly(vinyl alcohol) dehydrogenase from Sphingopyxis sp.113P3 in Escherichia coli by inclusion bodies renaturation.	Poly(vinyl alcohol) dehydrogenase (PVADH, EC 1.1.99.23) is an enzyme which has potential application in textile industry to degrade the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in waste water. Previously, a 1,965-bp fragment encoding a PVADH from Sphingopyxis sp. 113P3 was synthesized based on the replacement of the rare codons in Escherichia coli (E. coli). In this work, the deduced mature PVADH (mPVADH) gene of 1,887 bp was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into the site between NcoI and HindIII in pET-32a(+). The constructed recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli Rosetta (DE3). In shake flask, the fusion protein of thioredoxin (Trx)-mPVADH was expressed precisely; however, Trx-mPVADH was found to accumulate mainly as inclusion bodies. After isolating, dissolving in buffer containing urea, purification, dialysis renaturation, and digesting with recombinant enterokinase/His (rEK/His), the bioactive mPVADH fragments were obtained with protein concentration of 0.56 g/L and enzymatic activity of 194 U/mL. The K m and V max values for PVA 1799 were 2.33 mg/mL and 15.7 nmol/(min·mg protein), respectively. (1)H-NMR and infrared (IR) spectrum demonstrated that its biological function was oxidizing hydroxyl groups of PVA 1799 to form diketone, and PVA 1799 could be degraded completely by successive treatment with mPVADH and oxidized PVA hydrolase (OPH).	2014 Mar	Jia Dongxu,Yang Yu,Peng Zhengcong,Zhang Dongxu,Li Jianghua,Liu Long,Du Guocheng,Chen Jian	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 172(5) 2540-51	Poly(vinyl alcohol) dehydrogenase	SGTVAETAPQSGHAVPADQLDGETLYKARCAACHDNAEGRTPSREVLSKNPASFILASMRTGAMVPMAEGLTLEEMTAIARAVGKADAKTDDGIDLRRIWGNSVEGTPLDAPQCSSAPTPVDLGAANQWNGWSTEKDNGRFQRKPALDVADIPKLKLKWAFQYPGSKNGQATVIGDRLFTTSTSGAVYALNAKTGCVYWRHAAEGATRTSPVIAALPEGAPAKTALFFSDFTKAAVALDAETGKQLWKTVVDDQPALQMTGSITYWDGKIYVPISSGTEAFAQIPTWECCKFRGALVALDAATGKILWKRYTTEQEPRPFKLNKAGRQMWGPSGGAIWVTPTVDEARRLIYVGTSNSYTDVPYDNSDSVMAIDADTGAVRWTVQLLADDNYIDGCWQKGKEHANCPNPLGPDFSIGAAPIYRKMADGKEFLLVGQKSGMIYALDPANKGAKIWERQLSLGSALGGIEFGTAADDGKVYAGVSDIASQAKDRGKPGLWALDIRTGEVAWNFLNAPDTKCRWNNWWCHGAFSQAISVIPGAIFAGSYDGHFRAFDTATGKIIWDVDTGTKAVTTLSGAKAFGGVMDGAGPTIAGGMVYVHSGYAGRSSESGGRDLRGTDGNILMAFSVDGK	N-terminal thioredoxin tag and His6 tag	Q588Z1	oxidoreductase	full length	8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
24421036	Potent malaria transmission-blocking antibody responses elicited by Plasmodium falciparum Pfs25 expressed in Escherichia coli after successful protein refolding.	Production of Pfs25, a Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking vaccine target antigen, in functional conformation with the potential to elicit effective immunogenicity still remains a major challenge. In the current study, codon-harmonized recombinant Pfs25 (CHrPfs25) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified protein after simple oxidative refolding steps retained reduction-sensitive conformational epitopes of transmission-blocking monoclonal antibodies. CHrPfs25 formulated in several adjuvants elicited strong immunogenicity in preclinical studies in mice. Antibodies elicited after immunization recognized native Pfs25 on the surface of live gametes of P. falciparum and demonstrated complete malaria transmission-blocking activity. The transmission-blocking efficacy was 100 0.000000e+00ven after a 1:128 dilution of sera from immunized mice in the complete Freund&#39;s adjuvant and Montanide ISA51 groups and after a 1:16 dilution of sera from mice in the alum group. The blocking was mediated by antibodies; purified IgG at concentrations as low as 31.25 μg/ml exhibited 100% transmission blocking in membrane feeding assays employing two different species of mosquitoes, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi. This study provides the first evidence for successful expression of biologically functional rPfs25 in E. coli. The extremely potent malaria transmission-blocking activity of antibodies elicited by immunization with purified protein provides strong support for further evaluation of E. coli-derived CHrPfs25 as a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine in human clinical trials.	2014 Mar	Kumar Rajesh,Angov Evelina,Kumar Nirbhay	Infection and immunity. 82(4) 1453-9	Pfs25	IKYNNAKVTVDTVCKRGFLIQMSGHLECKCENDLVLVNEETCEEKVLKCDEKTVNKPCGDFSKCIKIDGNPVSYACKCNLGYDMVNNVCIPNECKNVTCGNGKCILDTSNPVKTGVCSCNIGKVPNVQDQNKCSKDGETKCSLKCLKENETCKAVDGIYKCDCKDGFIIDNESSICTAF		P13829	transmission-blocking vaccine target antigen	EGF-like domains 1, 2, 3, and 4	7.4	4	f	t	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
24445168	Effect of pressure on refolding of recombinant pentameric cholera toxin B.	The production of recombinant proteins is an essential tool for the expansion of modern biological research and biotechnology. The expression of heterologous proteins in Escherichia coli often results in an incomplete folding process that leads to the accumulation of inclusion bodies (IB), aggregates that hold a certain degree of native-like secondary structure. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) impairs intermolecular hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, leading to dissociation of aggregates under non-denaturing conditions and is therefore a useful tool to solubilize proteins for posterior refolding. Cholera toxin (CT) is composed of a non-toxic pentamer of B subunits (CTB), a useful adjuvant in vaccines, and a toxic subunit A (CTA). We studied the process of refolding of CTB using HHP. HHP was shown to be effective for dissociation of CTB monomers from IB. Posterior incubation at atmospheric pressure of concentrated CTB (1mg/ml) is necessary for the association of the monomers. Pentameric CTB was obtained when suspensions of CTB IB were compressed at 2.4kbar for 16h in the presence of Tween 20 and incubated at 1bar for 120h. Soluble and biologically active pentameric CTB was obtained, with a yield of 213mg CTB/liter of culture. The experience gained in this study can be important to improve the refolding of proteins with quaternary structure.	2014 Feb	Rodrigues D,Farinha-Arcieri L E,Ventura A M,Chura-Chambi R M,Malavasi N V,Lemke L S,Guimarães J S,Ho P L,Morganti L	Journal of biotechnology. 173 98-105	cholera toxin B	TPQNITDLCAEYHNTQIYTLNDKIFSYTESLAGKREMAIITFKNGAIFQVEVPGSQHIDSQKKAIERMKDTLRIAYLTEAKVEKLCVWNNKTPHAIAAISMAN		P01556	Enterotoxin	full length	8.5		f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
24446173	Cloning, expression, purification and refolding of microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 expressed in Escherichia coli.	Microtubule-associated protein/microtubule affinity-regulating kinase 4 (MARK4) is a member of the family Ser/Thr kinase and involved in numerous biological functions including microtubule bundle formation, nervous system development, positive regulation of programmed cell death, cell cycle control, cell polarity determination, cell shape alterations, cell division etc. For various biophysical and structural studies, we need this protein in adequate quantity. In this paper, we report a novel cloning strategy for MARK4. We have cloned MARK4 catalytic domain including 59 N-terminal extra residues with unknown function and catalytic domain alone in PQE30 vector. The recombinant MARK4 was expressed in the inclusion bodies in M15 cells. The inclusion bodies were solubilized effectively with 1.5% N-lauroylsarcosine in alkaline buffer and subsequently purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography in a single step with high purity and good concentration. Purity of protein was checked on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified by using mass spectrometry immunoblotting.

24494036	Influence of protein-micelle ratios and cysteine residues on the kinetic stability and unfolding rates of human mitochondrial VDAC-2.	Delineating the kinetic and thermodynamic factors which contribute to the stability of transmembrane β-barrels is critical to gain an in-depth understanding of membrane protein behavior. Human mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 2 (hVDAC-2), one of the key anti-apoptotic eukaryotic β-barrel proteins, is of paramount importance, owing to its indispensable role in cell survival. We demonstrate here that the stability of hVDAC-2 bears a strong kinetic contribution that is dependent on the absolute micellar concentration used for barrel folding. The refolding efficiency and ensuing stability is sensitive to the lipid-to-protein (LPR) ratio, and displays a non-linear relationship, with both low and high micellar amounts being detrimental to hVDAC-2 structure. Unfolding and aggregation process are sequential events and show strong temperature dependence. We demonstrate that an optimal lipid-to-protein ratio of 2600∶1 - 13,000∶1 offers the highest protection against thermal denaturation. Activation energies derived only for lower LPRs are ∼17 kcal mol(-1) for full-length hVDAC-2 and ∼23 kcal mol(-1) for the Cys-less mutant, suggesting that the nine cysteine residues of hVDAC-2 impart additional malleability to the barrel scaffold. Our studies reveal that cysteine residues play a key role in the kinetic stability of the protein, determine barrel rigidity and thereby give rise to strong micellar association of hVDAC-2. Non-linearity of the Arrhenius plot at high LPRs coupled with observation of protein aggregation upon thermal denaturation indicates that contributions from both kinetic and thermodynamic components stabilize the 19-stranded β-barrel. Lipid-protein interaction and the linked kinetic contribution to free energy of the folded protein are together expected to play a key role in hVDAC-2 recycling and the functional switch at the onset of apoptosis.	2014 Feb	Maurya Svetlana Rajkumar,Mahalakshmi Radhakrishnan	PloS one. 9(1) e87701	voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 2	MATHGQTCARPMCIPPSYADLGKAARDIFNKGFGFGLVKLDVKTKSCSGVEFSTSGSSNTDTGKVTGTLETKYKWCEYGLTFTEKWNTDNTLGTEIAIEDQICQGLKLTFDTTFSPNTGKKSGKIKSSYKRECINLGCDVDFDFAGPAIHGSAVFGYEGWLAGYQMTFDSAKSKLTRNNFAVGYRTGDFQLHTNVNDGTEFGGSIYQKVCEDLDTSVNLAWTSGTNCTRFGIAAKYQLDPTASISAKVNNSSLIGVGYTQTLRPGVKLTLSALVDGKSINAGGHKVGLALELEA		P45880	ion transport and regulation of metabolite conductance	full length	7.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
24494036	Influence of protein-micelle ratios and cysteine residues on the kinetic stability and unfolding rates of human mitochondrial VDAC-2.	Delineating the kinetic and thermodynamic factors which contribute to the stability of transmembrane β-barrels is critical to gain an in-depth understanding of membrane protein behavior. Human mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 2 (hVDAC-2), one of the key anti-apoptotic eukaryotic β-barrel proteins, is of paramount importance, owing to its indispensable role in cell survival. We demonstrate here that the stability of hVDAC-2 bears a strong kinetic contribution that is dependent on the absolute micellar concentration used for barrel folding. The refolding efficiency and ensuing stability is sensitive to the lipid-to-protein (LPR) ratio, and displays a non-linear relationship, with both low and high micellar amounts being detrimental to hVDAC-2 structure. Unfolding and aggregation process are sequential events and show strong temperature dependence. We demonstrate that an optimal lipid-to-protein ratio of 2600∶1 - 13,000∶1 offers the highest protection against thermal denaturation. Activation energies derived only for lower LPRs are ∼17 kcal mol(-1) for full-length hVDAC-2 and ∼23 kcal mol(-1) for the Cys-less mutant, suggesting that the nine cysteine residues of hVDAC-2 impart additional malleability to the barrel scaffold.

24498095	C-terminal engineering of CXCL12 and CCL5 chemokines: functional characterization by electrophysiological recordings.	Chemokines are chemotactic cytokines comprised of 70-100 amino acids. The chemokines CXCL12 and CCL5 are the endogenous ligands of the CXCR4 and CCR5 G protein-coupled receptors that are also HIV co-receptors. Biochemical, structural and functional studies of receptors are ligand-consuming and the cost of commercial chemokines hinders their use in such studies. Here, we describe methods for the expression, refolding, purification, and functional characterization of CXCL12 and CCL5 constructs incorporating C-terminal epitope tags. The model tags used were hexahistidines and Strep-Tag for affinity purification, and the double lanthanoid binding tag for fluorescence imaging and crystal structure resolution. The ability of modified and purified chemokines to bind and activate CXCR4 and CCR5 receptors was tested in Xenopus oocytes expressing the receptors, together with a Kir3 G-protein activated K(+) channel that served as a reporter of receptor activation. Results demonstrate that tags greatly influence the biochemical properties of the recombinant chemokines. Besides, despite the absence of any evidence for CXCL12 or CCL5 C-terminus involvement in receptor binding and activation, we demonstrated unpredictable effects of tag insertion on the ligand apparent affinity and efficacy or on the ligand dissociation. These tagged chemokines should constitute useful tools for the selective purification of properly-folded chemokines receptors and the study of their native quaternary structures.	2014 Feb	Picciocchi Antoine,Siaučiūnaiteė-Gaubard Lina,Petit-Hartlein Isabelle,Sadir Rabia,Revilloud Jean,Caro Lydia,Vivaudou Michel,Fieschi Franck,Moreau Christophe,Vivès Corinne	PloS one. 9(1) e87394	CXCL12	PVSLSYRCPCRFFESHVARANVKHLKILNTPNCALQIVARLKNNNRQVCIDPKLKWIQEYLEKALNK	without signal peptide, C-terminal His6 tag	P48061	Cytokine		8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f

24559319	MB109 as bioactive human bone morphogenetic protein-9 refolded and purified from E. coli inclusion bodies.	BACKGROUND:The development of chemical refolding of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) superfamily ligands has been instrumental to produce the recombinant proteins for biochemical studies and exploring the potential of protein therapeutics. The osteogenic human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (hBMP-2) and its Drosophila DPP homolog were the early successful cases of refolding into functional form. Despite the similarity in their three dimensional structure and amino acid sequences, several other TGF-β superfamily ligands could not be refolded readily by the same methods.RESULTS:Here, we report a comprehensive study on the variables of a rapid-dilution refolding method, including the concentrations of protein, salt, detergent and redox agents, pH, refolding duration and the presence of aggregation suppressors and host-cell contaminants, in order to identify the optimal condition to refold human BMP-9 (hBMP-9). To produce a recombinant form of hBMP-9 in E. coli cells, a synthetic codon-optimized gene was designed to encode the mature domain of hBMP-9 (Ser320 - Arg429) directly behind the first methionine, which we herein referred to as MB109. An effective purification scheme was also developed to purify the refolded MB109 to homogeneity with a final yield of 7.8 mg from 100 mg of chromatography-purified inclusion bodies as a starting material. The chemically refolded MB109 binds to ALK1, ActRIIb and BMPRII receptors with relatively high affinity as compared to other Type I and Type II receptors based on surface plasmon resonance analysis. Smad1-dependent luciferase assay in C2C12 cells shows that the MB109 has an EC50 of 0.61 ng/mL (25 pM), which is nearly the same as hBMP-9.CONCLUSION:MB109 is prone to be refolded as non-functional dimer and higher order multimers in most of the conditions tested, but bioactive MB109 dimer can be refolded with high efficiency in a narrow window, which is strongly dependent on the pH, refolding duration, the presence of aggregation suppressors and the concentrations of protein, salt and detergent. These results add to the current understanding of producing recombinant TGF-β superfamily ligands in the microbial E. coli system. An application of the technique to produce a large number of synthetic TGF-β chimeras for activity screen is also discussed.	2014 Feb	Kuo Mario Meng-Chiang,Nguyen Phuong Hong,Jeon Yun-Hui,Kim Subin,Yoon So-Mi,Choe Senyon	Microbial cell factories. 13(1) 29	BMP-9	MS AGAGSHCQKT SLRVNFEDIG WDSWIIAPKE YEAYECKGGCFFPLADDVTP TKHAIVQTLV HLKFPTKVGK ACCVPTKLSP ISVLYKDDMG VPTLKYHYEG MSVAECGCR	Ser320 – Arg429	Q9UK05	Cytokine		8.25	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24583234	Structural diversity of a collagen-binding matrix protein from the byssus of blue mussels upon refolding.	Blue mussels firmly adhere to a variety of different substrates by the byssus, an extracorporal structure consisting of several protein threads. These threads are mainly composed of fibrillar collagens called preCols which are embedded in a proteinaceous matrix. One of the two so far identified matrix proteins is the Proximal Thread Matrix Protein 1 (PTMP1). PTMP1 comprises two von Willebrand factor type A-like domains (A1 and A2) in a special arrangement. Here, we describe the refolding of recombinant PTMP1 from inclusion bodies. PTMP1 refolded into two distinct monomeric isoforms. Both isomers exhibited alternative intramolecular disulfide bonds. One of these isomers is thermodynamically favored and presumably represents the native form of PTMP1, while the other isoform is kinetically favored but is likely non-native. Oligomerization during refolding was influenced by, but not strictly dependent on disulfide formation. The conformational stability of PTMP1 indicates an influence of intramolecular disulfides on the native state, but not on unfolding intermediates. Monomeric PTMP1 exhibited a high thermal stability, dependent on the pH of the surrounding environment. Especially under acidic conditions the disulfide bonds were critically involved in thermal stability.	2014 Apr	Suhre Michael H,Scheibel Thomas	Journal of structural biology. 186(1) 75-85	Proximal Thread Matrix Protein 1 (PTMP1)	MGHHGVMPYEAVPVSYDPPAVAVEPPPYQPAVDPPPYQPGNTGKDAEECDVQADIIVLFDDSSSIQYDNKENYQMMKDFVKELVDSFTTVGVNGRNGSQFGVVQFSQGVKTAFPLNKFKTKEDIKKGIQDMVPRNGGQTEIGTGLKHVRENSFSGAEGGGNPDKQKIVILMTDGKSNAGAPPQHEAHKLKAEGVTVIAIGIGQGFVKTELEQIATMKNYVLTTNSFSELSTLLKLVIDLACEVCVVDCAGHADIAFVFDASSSINANNPNNYQLMKNFMKDIVDRFNKTGPDGTQFAVVTFADRATKQFGLKDYSSKADIKGAIDKVSPSIIGQTAIGDGLENARLEVFPNRNGGGREEVQKVVILLTDGQNNGHKSPEHESSLLRKEGVVIVAIGVGTGFLKSELINIASSEEYVFTTSSFDKLSKIMEDVVKLACMSCKPRAHKKGSGAIG		Q8T5C2	collagen-binding protein	full length	8		f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f

One of the two so far identified matrix proteins is the Proximal Thread Matrix Protein 1 (PTMP1). PTMP1 comprises two von Willebrand factor type A-like domains (A1 and A2) in a special arrangement. Here, we describe the refolding of recombinant PTMP1 from inclusion bodies. PTMP1 refolded into two distinct monomeric isoforms. Both isomers exhibited alternative intramolecular disulfide bonds. One of these isomers is thermodynamically favored and presumably represents the native form of PTMP1, while the other isoform is kinetically favored but is likely non-native. Oligomerization during refolding was influenced by, but not strictly dependent on disulfide formation. The conformational stability of PTMP1 indicates an influence of intramolecular disulfides on the native state, but not on unfolding intermediates. Monomeric PTMP1 exhibited a high thermal stability, dependent on the pH of the surrounding environment. Especially under acidic conditions the disulfide bonds were critically involved in thermal stability.	2014 Apr	Suhre Michael H,Scheibel Thomas	Journal of structural biology. 186(1) 75-85	Proximal Thread Matrix Protein 1 (PTMP1)	DCAGHADIAFVFDASSSINANNPNNYQLMKNFMKDIVDRFNKTGPDGTQFAVVTFADRATKQFGLKDYSSKADIKGAIDKVSPSIIGQTAIGDGLENARLEVFPNRNGGGREEVQKVVILLTDGQNNGHKSPEHESSLLRKEGVVIVAIGVGTGFLKSELINIASSEEYVFTTSSFDKLSKIMEDVVKLA	247-439	Q8T5C2	collagen-binding protein	VWA domain 2	8		f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f
24586769	Disulfide linkages in Plasmodium falciparum plasmepsin-i are essential elements for its processing activity and multi-milligram recombinant production yield.	Plasmodium falciparum plasmepsin-I (PM-I) has been considered a potential drug target for the parasite that causes fatal malaria in human. Determination of PM-I structures for rational design of its inhibitors is hindered by the difficulty in obtaining large quantity of soluble enzyme. Nearly all attempts for its heterologous expression in Escherichia coli result in the production of insoluble proteins in both semi-pro-PM-I and its truncated form, and thus require protein refolding. Moreover, the yields of purified, soluble PM-I from all reported studies are very limited. Exclusion of truncated semi-pro-PM-I expression in E. coli C41(DE3) is herein reported. We also show that the low preparation yield of purified semi-pro-PM-I with autoprocessing ability is mainly a result of structural instability of the refolded enzyme in acidic conditions due to incomplete formation of disulfide linkages. Upon formation of at least one of the two natural disulfide bonds, nearly all of the refolded semi-pro-PM-I could be activated to its mature form. A significantly improved yield of 10 mg of semi-pro-PM-I per liter of culture, which resulted in 6-8 mg of the mature PM-I, was routinely obtained using this strategy.	2014 Mar	Lolupiman Sirisak,Siripurkpong Pilaiwan,Yuvaniyama Jirundon	PloS one. 9(2) e89424	plasmepsin-I (PM-I)	DNVLFPKNKKINEIMNTSKHVIIGFSIENSHDRIMKTVKQHRLKNYIKESLKFFKTGLTQKPHLGNAGDSVTLNDVANVMYYGEAQIGDNKQKFAFIFDTGSANLWVPSAQCNTIGCKTKNLYDSNKSKTYEKDGTKVEMNYVSGTVSGFFSKDIVTIANLSFPYKFIEVTDTNGFEPAYTLGQFDGIVGLGWKDLSIGSVDPVVVELKNQNKIEQAVFTFYLPFDDKHKGYLTIGGIEDRFYEGQLTYEKLNHDLYWQVDLDLHFGNLTVEKATAIVDSGTSSITAPTEFLNKFFEGLDVVKIPFLPLYITTCNNPKLPTLEFRSATNVYTLEPEYYLQQIFDFGISLCMVSIIPVDLNKNTFILGDPFMRKYFTVFDYDNHTVGFALAKKKL	N-terminal His6 tag, 59-452	P39898	Aspartyl protease	semi-pro-PM-I	8.0	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24590372	A successful strategy for the recovering of active P21, an insoluble recombinant protein of Trypanosoma cruzi.	Structural studies of proteins normally require large quantities of pure material that can only be obtained through heterologous expression systems and recombinant technique. In these procedures, large amounts of expressed protein are often found in the insoluble fraction, making protein purification from the soluble fraction inefficient, laborious, and costly. Usually, protein refolding is avoided due to a lack of experimental assays that can validate correct folding and that can compare the conformational population to that of the soluble fraction. Herein, we propose a validation method using simple and rapid 1D (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra that can efficiently compare protein samples, including individual information of the environment of each proton in the structure.	2014 Mar	dos Santos Marlus Alves,Teixeira Francesco Brugnera,Moreira Heline Hellen Teixeira,Rodrigues Adele Aud,Machado Fabrício Castro,Clemente Tatiana Mordente,Brigido Paula Cristina,Silva Rebecca Tavares e,Purcino Cecílio,Gomes Rafael Gonçalves Barbosa,Bahia Diana,Mortara Renato Arruda,Munte Claudia Elisabeth,Horjales Eduardo,da Silva Claudio Vieira	Scientific reports. 4 4259	P21	MRFVFFLLVLFLACSVSAEEVVNRGYNHKEPHKRHHQSFGRHRHVRREEMRNATGVGCRGEIIRYCQTPVTGFYEYWWKCLSENMDRFSTPDCQTYINGMIACRNFTVSSYGPGEQSPDGLVKHLLHSENESIPNECRNSRFYKDAVVGFHRRQ	N-terminal His6 tag	A7LCP9			8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	t	f	f
24598928	Refolding, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies of the β-barrel domain of BamA, a membrane protein essential for outer membrane protein biogenesis.	In Gram-negative bacteria, the assembly of outer membrane proteins (OMPs) requires a five-protein β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, of which BamA is an essential and evolutionarily conserved integral outer membrane protein. Here, the refolding, crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic characterization of the β-barrel domain of BamA from Escherichia coli (EcBamA) are reported. Native and selenomethionine-substituted EcBamA proteins were crystallized at 16°C and X-ray diffraction data were collected to 2.6 and 3.7 Å resolution, respectively. The native crystals belonged to space group P21212, with unit-cell parameters a = 118.492, b = 159.883, c = 56.000 Å and two molecules in one asymmetric unit; selenomethionine-substituted protein crystals belonged to space group P4322, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 163.162, c = 46.388 Å and one molecule in one asymmetric unit. Initial phases for EcBamA β-barrel domain were obtained from a SeMet SAD data set. These preliminary X-ray crystallographic studies paved the way for further structural determination of the β-barrel domain of EcBamA.	2014 Mar	Ni Dongchun,Yang Kun,Huang Yihua	Acta crystallographica.

24607362	Expression, purification and characterization of a functional carbohydrate-binding module from Streptomyces sp. SirexAA-E.	Streptomyces sp. SirexAA-E (ActE) has been identified as a highly cellulolytic actinobacterium capable of deconstructing lignocellulosic biomass. SirexAA-E CAZymes most frequently contain a carbohydrate-binding module from family 2a (CBM2a). The DNA encoding the CBM2a from gene locus SACTE_0237, the most abundantly expressed cellulase from SirexAA-E, was cloned into an Escherichia coli expression vector and expressed as a C-terminal fusion protein to GFP. The GFP-CBM2a fusion protein was purified from insoluble inclusion bodies and refolded. The solubilized protein was separated by size-exclusion chromatography into high molecular weight GFP-CBM2a multimers and monomeric GFP-CBM2a. Only the monomeric CBM2a protein was found to have high relative affinity (partition coefficient of 0.62±0.04L/g) to cellulose. Binding of monomeric CBM2a prepared in this manner exhibits fully reversible, high affinity binding to cellulose.	2014 Apr	Lim Sungsoo,Chundawat Shishir P S,Fox Brian G	Protein expression and purification. 98 1-9	CBM2a	CTVDYKIQNQWNGGLTASVSVTNNGD-AISGWQLQWSFAG-GEQVSQGWNATVSQSGSAVTAKD--AGYNAALAT-G-ASASFGFNAT-GN-GN--SVVPATFKLNGVTC		G2NAA6	a carbohydrate-binding module	a carbohydrate-binding module domain	7.4	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24613299	Expression and characterization of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) matrix metalloproteinase-2 and its activity against type I collagen.	Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play essential roles in the metabolism of animal collagen while few reports are available for MMPs in aquatic animals. In this study, we report the complete sequence of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) gene from common carp (Cyprinus carpio) skeletal muscle. The full-length cDNA of MMP-2 was 2792bp which contains an open reading frame of 1974bp, corresponding to a protein of 657 amino acid residues. Based on the structural feature of MMP-2, the gene of the catalytic domain containing 351 amino acid residues was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. SDS-PAGE showed that the truncated recombinant MMP-2 (trMMP-2) with molecular mass of approximately 38kDa was in the form of inclusion body. The trMMP-2 was further purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. After renaturation, similar to native MMP-2, the trMMP-2 exhibited high hydrolyzing activity toward gelatin as appeared on gelatin zymography and optimal activity was at pH 8.0 and 40°C. The activity of the trMMP-2 was completely suppressed by metalloproteinase inhibitors, including EDTA, EGTA and 1,10-phenanthroline while other proteinase inhibitors did not show any inhibitory effect. Divalent metal ion Ca(2+) was necessary for the gelatinolytic activity, suggesting it is a calcium-dependent metalloproteinase. Moreover, the trMMP-2 effectively hydrolyzed native type I collagen at 37°C and even at 4°C, implying its potential application value as a collagenase for preparation of biologically active oligopeptides.	2014 Apr	Wang Ci,Zhan Chun-Lan,Cai Qiu-Feng,Du Cui-Hong,Liu Guang-Ming,Su Wen-Jin,Cao Min-Jie	Journal of biotechnology. 177 45-52	matrix metalloproteinase-2	YRILGHTPDLDEETIDDAFYRAFKVWSDVTPLKFTRIMDGEADIMINFGRNEHGDGYPFDGKDGLLAHAFAPGPGIGGEGHTPDLDEETIDDAFYRAFKVWSDVGEFCKFPFLFMGKEYTSCTSQGRDDGFLWCSTTYNFDEDGKYGFCPHELLFTLGGNADGAPCKFPFTFQGEKYDSCTTSGRDDGYRWCATTEDYDRDKKYGFCPETAMSTVGGNSEGAPCVFPFKFLGNTYDSCTTSGRSDGKMWCGVTKSFDDDRKWGFCPDQGYSLFLVAAHEFGHALGLEHSDDPGALMAPMYTFTKTLRLSDDDVKGIQDLYG	N-terminal His6 tag,	M4VLM9	Metalloprotease	catalytic domain	8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24615888	Crystal structure of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis phosphate binding protein PstS3.	Mycobacterium tuberculosis evades host immune responses by colonizing macrophages. Intraphagosomal M. tuberculosis is exposed to environmental stresses such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates as well as acid shock and inorganic phosphate (Pi) depletion. Experimental evidence suggests that expression levels of mycobacterial protein PstS3 (Rv0928) are significantly increased when M. tuberculosis bacilli are exposed to Pi starvation. Hence, PstS3 may be important for survival of Mtb in conditions where there is limited supply of Pi. We report here the structure of PstS3 from M. tuberculosis at 2.3-Å resolution. The protein presents a structure typical for ABC phosphate transfer receptors. Comparison with its cognate receptor PstS1 showed a different pattern distribution of surface charges in proximity to the Pi recognition site, suggesting complementary roles of the two proteins in Pi uptake.	2014 Aug	Ferraris Davide M,Spallek Ralf,Oehlmann Wulf,Singh Mahavir,Rizzi Menico	Proteins. 82(9) 2268-74	PstS3	MKLNRFGAAVGVLAAGALVLSACGNDDNVTGGGATTGQASAKVDCGGKKTLKASGSTAQANAMTRFVNVFEQACPGQTLNYTANGSGAGISEFNGNQTDFGGSDVPLSKDEAAAAQRRCGSPAWNLPVVFGPIAVTYNLNSVSSLNLDGPTLAKIFNGSITQWNNPAIQALNRDFTLPGERIHVVFRSDESGTTDNFQRYLQAASNGAWGKGAGKSFQGGVGEGARGNDGTSAAAKNTPGSITYNEWSFAQAQHLTMANIVTSAGGDPVAITIDSVGQTIAGATISGVGNDLVLDTDSFYRPKRPGSYPIVLATYEIVCSKYPDSQVGTAVKAFLQSTIGAGQSGLGDNGYIPIPDEFKSRLSTAVNAIA	C-terminal His6 tag	P0A5Y2	Phosphate transport	full length	7.3		f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t
24169042	Continuous processing of recombinant proteins: Integration of inclusion body solubilization and refolding using simulated moving bed size exclusion chromatography with buffer recycling.	An integrated process which combines continuous inclusion body dissolution with NaOH and continuous matrix-assisted refolding based on closed-loop simulated moving bed size exclusion chromatography was designed and experimentally evaluated at laboratory scale. Inclusion bodies from N(pro) fusion pep6His and N(pro) fusion MCP1 from high cell density fermentation were continuously dissolved with NaOH, filtered and mixed with concentrated refolding buffer prior to refolding by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). This process enabled an isocratic operation of the simulated moving bed (SMB) system with a closed-loop set-up with refolding buffer as the desorbent buffer and buffer recycling by concentrating the raffinate using tangential flow filtration. With this continuous refolding process, we increased the refolding and cleavage yield of both model proteins by 10compared to batch dilution refolding. Furthermore, more than 990f the refolding buffer of the raffinate could be recycled which reduced the buffer consumption significantly. Based on the actual refolding data, we compared throughput, productivity, and buffer consumption between two batch dilution refolding processes - one using urea for IB dissolution, the other one using NaOH for IB dissolution - and our continuous refolding process. The higher complexity of the continuous refolding process was rewarded with higher throughput and productivity as well as significantly lower buffer consumption compared to the batch dilution refolding processes.	2013 Nov	Wellhoefer Martin,Sprinzl Wolfgang,Hahn Rainer,Jungbauer Alois	Journal of chromatography.

24635450	Exploring the interaction of bisphenol-S with serum albumins: a better or worse alternative for bisphenol a?	The interaction of bisphenol-S (BPS) with serum albumins using steady-state, synchronous, time-resolved, and circular dichroism spectroscopies has been investigated. The binding interactions have also been investigated in the case of bisphenol A (BPA). The fluorescence quenching pathways are different for both of these endocrine disrupting compounds. Steady-state and time-resolved studies reveal static quenching at lower concentrations of BPS and dynamic quenching at higher concentrations. CD results also maintained the concentration dependent variation with a complete distortion of α-helices at 10(-5) M BPS. Besides this, addition of sodum dodecyl sulfate (SDS) results in the further unfolding of protein in the case of BPS, whereas time-resolved studies indicated refolding for BPA denatured human serum albumin (HSA). The entire study indicates an irreversible binding of BPS with HSA. Hence, these results reveal the possible involvement of BPS in the physiological pathway raising a health threat as already their presences in body fluids are known.	2014 Apr	Mathew M, Sreedhanya S, Manoj P, Aravindakumar CT, Aravind UK.

24647109	Purification and refolding of anti-T-antigen single chain antibodies (scFvs) expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies.	T-antigen (Galβ1-3GalNAcα-1-Ser/Thr) is an oncofetal antigen that is commonly expressed as a carbohydrate determinant in many adenocarcinomas. Since it is associated with tumor progression and metastasis, production of recombinant antibodies specific for T-antigen could lead to the development of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics. Previously, we isolated and characterized 11 anti-T-antigen phage clones from a phage library displaying human single-chain antibodies (scFvs) and purified one scFv protein, 1G11. More recently, we purified and characterized 1E8 scFv protein using a Drosophila S2 expression system. In the current study, four anti-T-antigen scFv genes belonging to Groups 1-4 were purified from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli cells. Inclusion bodies isolated from E. coli cells were denatured in 3.5 M Gdn-HCl. Solubilized His-tagged scFv proteins were purified using Ni(2+)-Sepharose column chromatography in the presence of 3.5 M Gdn-HCl. Purified scFv proteins were refolded according to a previously published method of step-wise dialysis. Two anti-T-antigen scFv proteins, 1E6 and 1E8 that belong to Groups 1 and 2, respectively, were produced in sufficient amounts, thus allowing further characterization of their binding activity with T-antigen. Specificity and affinity constants determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), respectively, provided evidence that both 1E8 and 1E6 scFv proteins are T-antigen specific and suggested that 1E8 scFv protein has a higher affinity for T-antigen than 1E6 scFv protein.	2014 Mar	Yuasa Noriyuki,Koyama Tsubasa,Fujita-Yamaguchi Yoko	Bioscience trends. 8(1) 24-31	anti-T-antigen single chain antibody				antibody		8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
24649022	Recombinant expression, different downstream processing of the disulfide-rich anti-tumor peptide Ranpirnase and its effect on the growth of human glioma cell line SHG-44.	Ranpirnase (Onconase) is a frogspawn-derived disulfide-rich peptide with ribonuclease activity that may be used for tumor treatment. In the present study, we established an efficient approach for preparing mature ranpirnase which may be used for research and therapeutic purposes. The designed ranpirnase precursors carried a 6xHis-tag and were recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. After S-sulfonation, the precursors were purified by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography. Following removal of the tag by aminopeptidase cleavage, cyclization and in vitro oxidative refolding, the mature ranpirnase was obtained with considerable yield, and the yield of mature ranpirnase was ~50-60 mg per liter cultures. In addition, ranpirnase inhibited the growth of human glioma cells SHG-44 in a dose-dependent manner. Thus the present study has provided an efficient approach for the preparation of active ranpirnase and its analogues for future studies.	2014 Mar	Wang Xiao-Min,Guo Zhan-Yun	Biomedical reports. 1(5) 747-750	Ranpirnase (Onconase)	QDWLTFQKKHITNTRDVDCDNIMSTNLFHCKDKNTFIYSRPEPVKAICKGIIASKNVLTTSEFYLSDCNVTSRPCKYKLKKSTNKFCVTCENQAPVHFVGVGSC	Gln1 is cyclized	P22069	Endonuclease	full length	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24722532	Fusion of protegrin-1 and plectasin to MAP30 shows significant inhibition activity against dengue virus replication.	Dengue virus (DENV) broadly disseminates in tropical and sub-tropical countries and there are no vaccine or anti-dengue drugs available. DENV outbreaks cause serious economic burden due to infection complications that requires special medical care and hospitalization. This study presents a new strategy for inexpensive production of anti-DENV peptide-fusion protein to prevent and/or treat DENV infection. Antiviral cationic peptides protegrin-1 (PG1) and plectasin (PLSN) were fused with MAP30 protein to produce recombinant antiviral peptide-fusion protein (PG1-MAP30-PLSN) as inclusion bodies in E. coli. High yield production of PG1-MAP30-PLSN protein was achieved by solubilization of inclusion bodies in alkaline buffer followed by the application of appropriate refolding techniques. Antiviral PG1-MAP30-PLSN protein considerably inhibited DENV protease (NS2B-NS3pro) with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) 0.5±0.1 μM. The real-time proliferation assay (RTCA) and the end-point proliferation assay (MTT assay) showed that the maximal-nontoxic dose of the peptide-fusion protein against Vero cells is approximately 0.67±0.2 μM. The cell-based assays showed considerable inhibition of the peptide-fusion protein against binding and proliferating stages of DENV2 into the target cells. The peptide-fusion protein protected DENV2-challeged mice with 1000f survival at the dose of 50 mg/kg. In conclusion, producing recombinant antiviral peptide-fusion protein by combining short antiviral peptide with a central protein owning similar activity could be useful to minimize the overall cost of short peptide production and take advantage of its synergistic antiviral activities.	2014 Apr	Rothan Hussin A,Bahrani Hirbod,Mohamed Zulqarnain,Abd Rahman Noorsaadah,Yusof Rohana	PloS one. 9(4) e94561	protegrin1	RGGRLCYCRR RFCVCVGR	131-148, His6-PG1-Map30-PLSN fusion protein	P32194	antibiotic agent		9.0	4.0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

In conclusion, producing recombinant antiviral peptide-fusion protein by combining short antiviral peptide with a central protein owning similar activity could be useful to minimize the overall cost of short peptide production and take advantage of its synergistic antiviral activities.	2014 Apr	Rothan Hussin A,Bahrani Hirbod,Mohamed Zulqarnain,Abd Rahman Noorsaadah,Yusof Rohana	PloS one. 9(4) e94561	plectasin	GFGCNGPWDEDDMQCHNHCKSIKGYKGGYCAKGGFVCKCY	without sinnal peptide and propeptide(56-95), His6-PG1-Map30-PLSN fusion protein	Q53I06	antibiotic agent		9.0	4.0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24723509	Refolding and purification of recombinant human (Pro)renin receptor from Escherichia coli by ion exchange chromatography.	Purification of the recombinant human renin receptor (rhRnR) is a major aspect of its biological or biophysical analysis, as well as structural research. A simple and efficient method for the refolding and purification of rhRnR expressed in Escherichia coli with weak anion-exchange chromatography (WAX) was presented in this work. The solution containing denatured rhRnR in 8.0 mol/L urea extracted from the inclusion bodies was directly injected into the WAX column. The aggregation was prevented and the soluble form of renatured rhRnR in aqueous solution was obtained after desorption from the column. Effects of the extracting solutions, the pH values and urea concentrations in the mobile phase, as well as the sample size on the refolding and purification of rhRnR were investigated, indicating that the above mentioned factors had remarkable influences on the efficiency of refolding, purification and mass recovery of rhRnR. Under the optimal conditions, rhRnR was successfully refolded and purified simultaneously by WAX in one step within only 30 min. The result was satisfactory with mass recovery of 71.8% and purity of 94.8%, which was further tested by western blotting. The specific binding of the purified rhRnR to recombinant human renin was also determined using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). The association constant of rhRnR to recombinant human renin was calculated to be 3.25 × 10(8) L/mol, which demonstrated that rhRnR was already renatured and simultaneously purified in one step using WAX. All of the above demonstrate that protein folding liquid chromatography (PFLC) should be a powerful tool for the purification and renaturation of rhRnR.	2014 Jul	Wang Fei,Guo Jinjin,Bai Quan,Wang Lili	Biotechnology progress. 30(4) 864-71	human renin receptor	MAVFVVLLALVAGVLGNEFSILKSPGSVVFRNGNWPIPGERIPDVAALSMGFSVKEDLSWPGLAVGNLFHRPRATVMVMVKGVNKLALPPGSVISYPLENAVPFSLDSVANSIHSLFSEETPVVLQLAPSEERVYMVGKANSVFEDLSVTLRQLRNRLFQENSVLSSLPLNSLSRNNEVDLLFLSELQVLHDISSLLSRHKHLAKDHSPDLYSLELAGLDEIGKRYGEDSEQFRDASKILVDALQKFADDMYSLYGGNAVVELVTVKSFDTSLIRKTRTILEAKQAKNPASPYNLAYKYNFEYSVVFNMVLWIMIALALAVIITSYNIWNMDPGYDSIIYRMTNQKIRMD		O75787	Functions as a renin and prorenin cellular receptor.

24743573	Overexpression of aprE2, a fibrinolytic enzyme gene from Bacillus subtilis CH3-5, in Escherichia coli and the properties of AprE2.	The aprE2 gene with its prosequence from Bacillus subtilis CH3-5 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) by using plasmid pET26b(+). After IPTG induction, active and mature AprE2 was produced when cells were grown at 20°C, whereas inactive and insoluble enzyme was produced in a large amount when cells were grown at 37°C. The insoluble fraction was resuspended with 6 M guanidine-HCl and dialyzed against 2 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) or 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 7.0) buffer. Then active AprE2 was regenerated and purified by a Ni-NTA column. Purified AprE2 from the soluble fraction had a specific activity of 1,069.4 ± 42.4 U/mg protein, higher than that from the renatured insoluble fraction. However, more active AprE2 was obtained by renaturation of the insoluble fraction. AprE2 was most stable at pH 7 and 40°C, respectively. The fibrinolytic activity of AprE2 was inhibited by PMSF, but not by EDTA and metal ions. AprE2 degraded Aα and Bβ chains of fibrinogen quickly, but not the γ-chain. AprE2 exhibited the highest specificity for N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA. The Km and kcat/Km of AprE2 was 0.56 mM and 3.10 × 10(4) S(-1) M(-1), respectively.	2014 Jul	Jeong Seon-Ju,Cho Kye Man,Lee Chang Kwon,Kim Gyoung Min,Shin Jung-Hye,Kim Jong Sang,Kim Jeong Hwan	Journal of microbiology and biotechnology. 24(7) 969-78	AprE2	MRSKKLWISLLFALTLIFTMAFSNMSAQAAGKSSTEKKYIVGFKQTMSAMSSAKKKDVISEKGGKVQKQFKYVNAAAATLDEKAVKELKKDPSVAYVEEDHIAHEYAQSVPYGISQIKAPALHSQGYTGSNVKVAVIDSGIDSSHPDLNVRGGASFVPSETNPYQDGSSHGTHVAGTIAALNNSIGVLGVAPSASLYAVKVLDSTGSGQYSWIINGIEWAISNNMDVINMSLGGPSGSTALKTVVDKAASSGIVVAAAAGNEGSSGSSSTVGYPAKYPSTIAVGAVNSSNQRASFSSAGSELDVMAPGVSIQSTLPGGTYGAYNGTSMATPHVAGAAALILSKHPTWTNAQVRDRLESTATYLGNSFYYGKGLINVQAAAQ	C-terminal His6 tag	A0FI80	Serine protease	full length	7.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24755191	Fast and economic immobilization methods described for non-commercial Pseudomonas lipases.	BACKGROUND:There is an increasing interest to seek new enzyme preparations for the development of new products derived from bioprocesses to obtain alternative bio-based materials. In this context, four non-commercial lipases from Pseudomonas species were prepared, immobilized on different low-cost supports, and examined for potential biotechnological applications.RESULTS:To reduce costs of eventual scaling-up, the new lipases were obtained directly from crude cell extracts or from growth culture supernatants, and immobilized by simple adsorption on Accurel EP100, Accurel MP1000 and Celite®545. The enzymes evaluated were LipA and LipC from Pseudomonas sp. 42A2, a thermostable mutant of LipC, and LipI.3 from Pseudomonas CR611, which were produced in either homologous or heterologous hosts. Best immobilization results were obtained on Accurel EP100 for LipA and on Accurel MP1000 for LipC and its thermostable variant. Lip I.3, requiring a refolding step, was poorly immobilized on all supports tested (best results for Accurel MP1000). To test the behavior of immobilized lipases, they were assayed in triolein transesterification, where the best results were observed for lipases immobilized on Accurel MP1000.CONCLUSIONS:The suggested protocol does not require protein purification and uses crude enzymes immobilized by a fast adsorption technique on low-cost supports, which makes the method suitable for an eventual scaling up aimed at biotechnological applications. Therefore, a fast, simple and economic method for lipase preparation and immobilization has been set up. The low price of the supports tested and the simplicity of the procedure, skipping the tedious and expensive purification steps, will contribute to cost reduction in biotechnological lipase-catalyzed processes.	2014 Apr	Cesarini Silvia,Infanzón Belén,Pastor F I Javier,Diaz Pilar	BMC biotechnology. 14 27	LipI.3	MGVYDYKNFGTAESKALFSDAMAITLYSYHNLDNGFAVGYQHNGFGLGLPATLVTALIGGTDSQGVIPGIPWNPDSEKAALDAVQKAGWTPITASQLGYEGKTDARDTFFGEKAGYTSAQVEILGKHDAQGHLTEIGIAFRGTSGPREILIGDSIGDVINDLLAAFGPKDYAKNYVGEAFGNLMNDVVAFAKANGLTGKDVLVSGHSLGGLAVNSMADLSTSKWGGFFQYSNYIAYASPTQSSTDKVLNVGYENDPVFRALDGSTFTGASLGVHDAPKESATDNIVSFNDHYALAAWNVLPYSIVNIPTWISHLPTAYGDGMNRVIESKFYDLTSKNSTIIVANLSDPARANTWVQDLNRNAETHKGSTFIIGSDANDLIQGGSGNDYLEGRAGNDTFRDGGGYNILLGGSGNNTLELQKSVNTFDFANDGAGNLYIRDANGGISITRDIGSIVTKEPGFLWGLFKDDVTHSVTATGLKVGNNVTQYESSVKGTGGADTLKAKAGGDWLFGLDGNDHLIGGAGNDVFVGGAGNDLMESGGGADTFLFSGAFGQDRVVGYTANDKLVFLGVQGVLPNDDFRAHATAVGQDTVLKFGADSVTLVGVALNSLSADGIVIA		I7EE73	Hydrolase		7.0	4.0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24798881	Blocking monocyte transmigration in in vitro system by a human antibody scFv anti-CD99. Efficient large scale purification from periplasmic inclusion bodies in E. coli expression system.	Migration of leukocytes into site of inflammation involves several steps mediated by various families of adhesion molecules. CD99 play a significant role in transendothelial migration (TEM) of leukocytes. Inhibition of TEM by specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) can provide a potent therapeutic approach to treating inflammatory conditions. However, the therapeutic utilization of whole IgG can lead to an inappropriate activation of Fc receptor-expressing cells, inducing serious adverse side effects due to cytokine release. In this regard, specific recombinant antibody in single chain variable fragments (scFvs) originated by phage library may offer a solution by affecting TEM function in a safe clinical context. However, this consideration requires large scale production of functional scFv antibodies and the absence of toxic reagents utilized for solubilization and refolding step of inclusion bodies that may discourage industrial application of these antibody fragments. In order to apply the scFv anti-CD99 named C7A in a clinical setting, we herein describe an efficient and large scale production of the antibody fragments expressed in E. coli as periplasmic insoluble protein avoiding gel filtration chromatography approach, and laborious refolding step pre- and post-purification. Using differential salt elution which is a simple, reproducible and effective procedure we are able to separate scFv in monomer format from aggregates. The purified scFv antibody C7A exhibits inhibitory activity comparable to an antagonistic conventional mAb, thus providing an excellent agent for blocking CD99 signaling. This protocol can be useful for the successful purification of other monomeric scFvs which are expressed as periplasmic inclusion bodies in bacterial systems.	2014 Jul	Moricoli Diego,Muller William Anthony,Carbonella Damiano Cosimo,Balducci Maria Cristina,Dominici Sabrina,Watson Richard,Fiori Valentina,Weber Evan,Cianfriglia Maurizio,Scotlandi Katia,Magnani Mauro	Journal of immunological methods. 408 35-45	human antibody scFv anti-CD99			P14209			7.5		f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24816107	Structure of a three-dimensional domain-swapped dimer of the Helicobacter pylori type IV secretion system pilus protein CagL.	A new crystal form of the Helicobacter pylori type IV secretion system (T4SS) pilus protein CagL is described here. In contrast to two previously reported monomeric structures, CagL forms a three-dimensional domain-swapped dimer. CagL dimers can arise during refolding from inclusion bodies or can form spontaneously from purified monomeric CagL in the crystallization conditions. Monomeric CagL forms a three-helix bundle, with which the N-terminal helix is only loosely associated. In the new crystal form, the N-terminal helix is missing. The domain swap is owing to exchange of the C-terminal helix between the two protomers of a dimer. A loop-to-helix transition results in a long helix of 108 amino acids comprising the penultimate and the last helix of the monomer. The RGD motif of dimeric CagL adopts an α-helical conformation. In contrast to the previously reported structures, the conserved and functionally important C-terminal hexapeptide is resolved. It extends beyond the three-helix bundle as an exposed helical appendage. This new crystal form contributes to the molecular understanding of CagL by highlighting rigid and flexible regions in the protein and by providing the first view of the C-terminus. Based on the structural features, a previously unrecognized homology between CagL and CagI is discussed.	2014 May	Barden Stephan,Schomburg Benjamin,Conradi Jens,Backert Steffen,Sewald Norbert,Niemann Hartmut H	Acta crystallographica.

24858950	The use of amphipols for NMR structural characterization of 7-TM proteins.	While amphipols have been proven useful for refolding of seven transmembrane helical (7-TM) proteins including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and it could be shown that an amphipol environment is in principle suitable for NMR structural studies of the embedded protein, high-resolution NMR insights into amphipol refolded and isotopically labeled GPCRs are still very limited. Here we report on the recent progress toward NMR structural studies of the melanocortin-2 and -4 receptors, two class A GPCRs which so far have not been reported to be incorporated into an amphipol environment. Making use of the established 7-TM protein bacteriorhodopsin (BR) we initially tested and optimized amphipol refolding conditions. Most promising conditions were transferred to the refolding of the two melanocortin receptors. Analytical-scale refolding experiments on the melanocortin-2 receptor show very similar behavior to the results obtained on BR. Using cell-free protein expression we could generate sufficient amounts of isotopically labeled bacteriorhodopsin as well as melanocortin-2 and -4 receptors for an initial NMR analysis. Upscaling of the amphipol refolding protocol to protein amounts needed for NMR structural studies was, however, not straightforward and impeded detailed NMR insights for the two GPCRs. While well-resolved and dispersed NMR spectra could only be obtained for bacteriorhodopsin, a comparison of NMR data recorded on the melanocortin-4 receptor in SDS and in an amphipol environment indicates that amphipol refolding induces larger structural modifications in the receptor.	2014 Oct	Elter Shantha,Raschle Thomas,Arens Sabine,Viegas Aldino,Gelev Vladimir,Etzkorn Manuel,Wagner Gerhard	The Journal of membrane biology. 247(9-10) 957-64	Bacteriorhodopsin	MLELLPTAVEGVSQAQITGRPEWIWLALGTALMGLGTLYFLVKGMGVSDPDAKKFYAITTLVPAIAFTMYLSMLLGYGLTMVPFGGEQNPIYWARYADWLFTTPLLLLDLALLVDADQGTILALVGADGIMIGTGLVGALTKVYSYRFVWWAISTAAMLYILYVLFFGFTSKAESMRPEVASTFKVLRNVTVVLWSAYPVVWLIGSEGAGIVPLNIETLLFMVLDVSAKVGFGLILLRSRAIFGEAEAPEPSAGDGAAATSD	N-terminal His10 tag	P02945	Light-driven proton pump		7.5	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f

24883307	Highly effective renaturation of a streptokinase from Streptococcus pyogenes DT7 as inclusion bodies overexpressed in Escherichia coli.	The streptokinase (SK) is emerging as an important thrombolytic therapy agent in the treatment of patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. We reported highly effective renaturation of a SK from S. pyogeness DT7 overexpressed in E. coli, purification, and biochemical characterization. A gene coding for the SK was cloned from S. pyogeness DT7. Because accumulation of active SK is toxic to the host cells, we have expressed it in the form of inclusion bodies. The mature protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21 DE3/pESK under the control of the strong promoter tac induced by IPTG with a level of 600f the total cell proteins. The activity of the rSK, renatured in phosphate buffer supplemented with Triton X-100 and glycerol, was covered with up to 41 folds of its initial activity. The purified of protein was identified with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry through four peptide fragments, which showed 100 0dentification to the corresponding peptides of the putative SK from GenBank. Due to overexpression and highly effective renaturation of large amounts of inclusion bodies, the recombinant E. coli BL21 DE3/pESK system could be potentially applied for large-scale production of SK used in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction.	2014 Jun	Nguyen Sy Le Thanh,Quyen Dinh Thi,Vu Hong Diep	BioMed research international. 2014 324705	streptokinase	IAGPEWLLGRPSVNNSQLVVSVAGTVEGTNQEISLKFFEIDLTSRPAQGGKTEQGLRPKSKPLATDKGAMSHKLEKADLLKAIQEQLIANVHSNDGYFEVIDFASDATITDRNGKVYFADRDDSVTLPTQPVQEFLLSGHVRVRPYRPKAVHNSAERVNVNYEVSFVSETGNLDFTPSLKEQYHLTTLAVGDSLSSQELAAIAQFILSKKHPDYIITKRDSSIVTHDNDIFRTILPMDQEFTYHIKDREQAYKANSKTGIEEKTNNTDLISEKYYILKKGEKPYDPFDRSHLKLFTIKYVDVDTKALLKSEQLLTASERNLDFRDLYDPRDKAKLLYNNLDAFGIMGYTLTGKVEDNHDDTNRIITVYMGKRPEGENASYHLAYDKDRYTEEEREVYSYLRDTGTPIPDNPKDK	without signal peptide, C-terminal His6tag	P96471	plasminogen activation		7	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24885571	A variant of green fluorescent protein exclusively deposited to active intracellular inclusion bodies.	BACKGROUND:Inclusion bodies (IBs) were generally considered to be inactive protein deposits and did not hold any attractive values in biotechnological applications. Recently, some IBs of recombinant proteins were confirmed to show their functional properties such as enzyme activities, fluorescence, etc. Such biologically active IBs are not commonly formed, but they have great potentials in the fields of biocatalysis, material science and nanotechnology.RESULTS:In this study, we characterized the IBs of DL4, a deletion variant of green fluorescent protein which forms active intracellular aggregates. The DL4 proteins expressed in Escherichia coli were exclusively deposited to IBs, and the IBs were estimated to be mostly composed of active proteins. The spectral properties and quantum yield of the DL4 variant in the active IBs were almost same with those of its native protein. Refolding and stability studies revealed that the deletion mutation in DL4 didn&#39;t affect the folding efficiency of the protein, but destabilized its structure. Analyses specific for amyloid-like structures informed that the inner architecture of DL4 IBs might be amorphous rather than well-organized. The diameter of fluorescent DL4 IBs could be decreased up to 100-200 nm by reducing the expression time of the protein in vivo.CONCLUSIONS:To our knowledge, DL4 is the first GFP variant that folds correctly but aggregates exclusively in vivo without any self-aggregating/assembling tags. The fluorescent DL4 IBs have potentials to be used as fluorescent biomaterials. This study also suggests that biologically active IBs can be achieved through engineering a target protein itself.	2014 Jun	Raghunathan Govindan,Munussami Ganapathiraman,Moon Hyojin,Paik Hyun-jong,An Seong Soo A,Kim Yong-Sung,Kang Sebyung,Lee Sun-Gu	Microbial cell factories. 13 68	Green fluorescent protein	MSKGEELFTGVVPILVELDGDVNGHKFSVSGEGEGDATYGKLTLKFICTTGKLPVPWPTLVTTFSYGVQCFSRYPDHMKQHDFFKSAMPEGYVQERTIFFKDDGNYKTRAEVKFEGDTLVNRIELKGIDFKEDGNILGHKLEYNYNSHNVYIMADKQKNGIKVNFKIRHNIEDGSVQLADHYQQNTPIGDDNHYLSTQSALSKDPNEKRDHMVLLEFVTAAGITHGMDELYK	deletion of 191-196 loop sequences	P42212	photoprotein		7.4		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
24904677	Improved methodology to obtain large quantities of correctly folded recombinant N-terminal extracellular domain of the human muscle acetylcholine receptor for inducing experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis in rats.	INTRODUCTION:Human myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular system. Experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) is a well-established animal model for MG that can be induced by active immunization with the Torpedo californica-derived acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Due to the expensive cost of purifying AChR from Torpedo californica, the development of an easier and more economical way of inducing EAMG remains critically needed.MATERIAL AND METHODS:Full-length cDNA of the human skeletal muscle AChR α1 subunit was obtained from TE671 cells. The DNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain (ECD) was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and inserted into pET-16b. The reconstructed plasmid was transformed into the host strain BL21(DE3)pLysS, which was derived from Escherichia coli. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was used to induce the expression of the N-terminal ECD. The produced protein was purified with immobilized Ni(2+) affinity chromatography and refolded by dialysis.RESULTS:The recombinant protein was efficiently refolded to soluble active protein, which was verified by ELISA. After immunization with the recombinant ECD, all rats acquired clinical signs of EAMG. The titer of AChR antibodies in the serum was significantly higher in the EAMG group than in the control group, indicating successful induction of EAMG.CONCLUSIONS:We describe an improved procedure for refolding recombinant ECD of human muscle AChR. This improvement allows for the generation of large quantities of correctly folded recombinant ECD of human muscle AChR, which provides for an easier and more economical way of inducing the animal model of MG.	2014 Jun	Sun Chenjing,Zhang Hongliang,Xu Jiang,Gao Jie,Qi Xiaokun,Li Zhuyi	Archives of medical science : AMS. 10(2) 389-95	acetylcholine receptor α1	SEHETRLVAKLFKDYSSVVRPVEDHRQVVEVTVGLQLIQLINVDEVNQIVTTNVRLKQGDMVDLPRPSCVTLGVPLFSHLQNEQWVDYNLKWNPDDYGGVKKIHIPSEKIWRPDLVLYNNADGDFAIVKFTKVLLQYTGHITWTPPAIFKSYCEIIVTHFPFDEQNCSMKLGTWTYDGSVVAINPESDQPDLSNFMESGEWVIKESR	N-terminal His10 tag, without signal peptide	P02708	Ion channel	N-terminal extracellular domain			f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24908076	Expression of liver-targeting peptide modified recombinant human endostatin and preliminary study of its biological activities.	Recombinant human endostatin (rEndostatin or endostar) has been shown to inhibit endothelial cells proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis and exhibits a broad spectrum of activities against solid tumors. However, rEndostatin is easily degradable and evenly distributed to all tissues. Selectively delivering rEndostatin to the lesion site might be more potent. The circumsporozoite protein (CSP) coats the malarial sporozoite and targets the liver for infection; I-plus of N end of CSP could specifically bind to the liver. Based on this, we hypothesize the fusion protein with introducing the CSP I-plus sequence into rEndostatin (rES-CSP) of which not only targets the liver, but also inhibits endothelial cells proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Therefore, it selectively reduces angiogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and improves the anti-HCC effect. In this study, we synthesized a novel rES-CSP fusion gene by SOE-PCR and expressed the fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL2l (DE3). The suitable conditions were optimized by an orthogonal test (L(25)(5)(4)). The yields were 12 mg/l culture medium following refolding and purification on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) metal affinity chromatography matrices. The purified rES-CSP is specifically targeted to the hepatocyte and inhibited the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a dose-dependent manner and showed potent antiangiogenic capability on HUVECs tube formation assay and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. These results lay the foundation for the further study of its targeting and anti-HCC in vivo and provide a feasible and convenient approach to produce liver-targeting drugs for treatment of the liver diseases.	2014 Aug	Ma Y,Jin X-B,Chu F-J,Bao D-Mei,Zhu J-Y	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 98(18) 7923-33	endostatin	HSHRDFQPVLHLVALNSPLSGGMRGIRGADFQCFQQARAVGLAGTFRAFLSSRLQDLYSIVRRADRAAVPIVNLKDELLFPSWEALFSGSEGPLKPGARIFSFDGKDVLRHPTWPQKSVWHGSDPNGRRLTESYCETWRTEAPSATGQASSLLGGRLLGQSAASCHHAYIVLCIENSFMTASK	N-terminal His tag, C-tarminal CSP I-plus (DNEKLRKPKHKKLKQPADG)	P39060	anti-angiogenic agent	endostatin domain	8.0		t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

The main advantage of these new tools is that they allow the noninvasive diagnosis of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Here, we describe the cloning, expression, purification, and stabilization of a chimeric protein specifically designed to probe cells and tissues for the presence of LDL(-), a relevant marker of atherosclerosis. The DNA sequence that encodes the anti-LDL(-) scFv, previously obtained from a hybridoma secreting an anti-LDL(-) monoclonal antibody, was inserted into the bacterial vector pET-28a(+) in tandem with a DNA sequence encoding GFP. The recombinant protein was expressed in high yields in E. coli as inclusion bodies. The applicability of GFP-scFv was assessed by ELISA, which determined its affinity for LDL(-) and confocal microscopy, that showed macrophage uptake of the protein along with LDL(-). In conclusion, our data suggest that the anti-LDL(-) GFP-scFv chimeric protein could be useful in studies on atherogenesis as well as for developing diagnostic tools for atherosclerosis.	2014 Oct	Faulin Tanize do Espirito Santo,Guilherme Daniel Ferreira,Silva Aldacilene Souza,Abdalla Dulcineia Saes Parra,Hering Vitor Renaux,Politi Mario José,Maranhão Andrea Queiroz	Biotechnology progress. 30(5) 1206-13	GFP-scFv				antibody		8.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24925645	Expression, purification and refolding of active durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) secretory phospholipase A2 from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli.	Recently, a durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) secretory phospholipase A2 (TdsPLA2III) was identified in leaves as potentially involved in plant responses to conditions of limiting water supply. Therefore, to allow future functional studies on TdsPLA2III and shed further light on the involvement of sPLA2 isoforms in specific plant functions, here we report a protocol for the overexpression of TdsPLA2III in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies, and for its purification and refolding. The use of the Gateway system (Invitrogen) allows the expression of a large quantity of the mature form (without the signal peptide) of TdsPLA2III with an N-terminal 6×His-tag, for purification using Ni-affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant 6×His-TdsPLA2III fusion protein is then refolded using a step-wise dialysis approach. About 40mg purified and active protein was obtained from 1L of cell culture. This recombinant 6×His-TdsPLA2III protein shows PLA2 activity, as it can hydrolyze linoleate from the sn-2 position of 1-palmitoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Moreover, it has some features that are typical of other known plant sPLA2s: Ca(2+)-dependence, inhibition by the disulfide bond reducing agent dithiothreitol, and resistance to high temperature.	2014 Aug	Verlotta Angelo,Trono Daniela	Protein expression and purification. 101 28-36	TdsPLA2III	LNVGLQTLDADGDGVSKQQACSRTCESDHCTTAPFLRYGKYCGILYSGCPGERPCDPLDACCMHHDNCVLVKNDYLSTECNEGLLECLAELRDGTGTFEGNKCMIDEVIDVITVVIEAAVVAGRVLHKP	34-162（without signal peptide)	M1GL46	to catalyze phospholipid hydrolysis	PLipase_A2_plant	7	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
24931846	Oxidative refolding of rPA in l-ArgHCl and in ionic liquids: A correlation between hydrophobicity, salt effects, and refolding yield.	The ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride (EMIM Cl) and the amino acid l-arginine hydrochloride (l-ArgHCl) have been successfully used to improve the yield of oxidative refolding for various proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms behind the actions of such solvent additives-especially of ionic liquids-are still not well understood. To analyze these mechanisms, we have determined the transfer free energies from water into ionic liquid solutions of proteinogenic amino acids and of diketopiperazine as peptide bond analogue. For EMIM Cl and 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium diethyl phosphate, which had a suppressive effect on protein refolding, as well as for l-ArgHCl favorable interactions with amino acid side chains, but no favorable interactions with the peptide backbone could be observed. A quantitative analysis of other ionic liquids together with their already published effects on protein refolding showed that only solvent additives within a certain range of hydrophobicity, chaotropicity and kosmotropicity were effective for the refolding of recombinant plasminogen activator.	2014 Aug	Tischer Alexander,Lilie Hauke,Auton Matthew,Lange Christian	Biopolymers. 101(11) 1129-40	plasminogen activator	SYQVICRDEKTQMIYQQHQSWLRPVLRSNRVEYCWCNSGRAQCHSVPVKSCSEPRCFNGGTCQQALYFSDFVCQCPEGFAGKCCEIDTRATCYEDQGISYRGTWSTAESGAECTNWNSSALAQKPYSGRRPDAIRLGLGNHNYCRNPDRDSKPWCYVFKAGKYSSEFCSTPACSEGNSDCYFGNGSAYRGTHSLTESGASCLPWNSMILIGKVYTAQNPSAQALGLGKHNYCRNPDGDAKPWCHVLKNRRLTWEYCDVPSCSTCGLRQYSQPQFRIKGGLFADIASHPWQAAIFAKHRRSPGERFLCGGILISSCWILSAAHCFQERFPPHHLTVILGRTYRVVPGEEEQKFEVEKYIVHKEFDDDTYDNDIALLQLKSDSSRCAQESSVVRTVCLPPADLQLPDWTECELSGYGKHEALSPFYSERLKEAHVRLYPSSRCTSQHLLNRTVTDNMLCAGDTRSGGPQANLHDACQGDSGGPLVCLNDGRMTLVGIISWGLGCGQKDVPGVYTKVTNYLDWIRDNMRP		P00750	Serine protease		8.5		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
24941919	One-step refolding and purification of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (rhTNF-α) using ion-exchange chromatography.	Protein refolding is a key step for the production of recombinant proteins, especially at large scales, and usually their yields are very low. Chromatographic-based protein refolding techniques have proven to be superior to conventional dilution refolding methods. High refolding yield can be achieved using these methods compared with dilution refolding of proteins. In this work, recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (rhTNF-α) from inclusion bodies expressed in Escherichia coli was renatured with simultaneous purification by ion exchange chromatography with a DEAE Sepharose FF column. Several chromatographic parameters influencing the refolding yield of the denatured/reduced rhTNF-α, such as the urea concentration, pH value and concentration ratio of glutathione/oxidized glutathione in the mobile phase, were investigated in detail. Under optimal conditions, rhTNF-α can be renatured and purified simultaneously within 30 min by one step. Specific bioactivity of 2.18 × 10(8) IU/mg, purity of 95.2% and mass recovery of 76.80f refolded rhTNF-α were achieved. Compared with the usual dilution method, the ion exchange chromatography method developed here is simple and more effective for rhTNF-α refolding in terms of specific bioactivity and mass recovery.	2015 Jan	Wang Yan,Ren Wenxuan,Gao Dong,Wang Lili,Yang Ying,Bai Quan	Biomedical chromatography : BMC. 29(2) 305-11	tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α)	MSTESMIRDVELAEEALPKKTGGPQGSRRCLFLSLFSFLIVAGATTLFCLLHFGVIGPQREEFPRDLSLISPLAQAVRSSSRTPSDKPVAHVVANPQAEGQLQWLNRRANALLANGVELRDNQLVVPSEGLYLIYSQVLFKGQGCPSTHVLLTHTISRIAVSYQTKVNLLSAIKSPCQRETPEGAEAKPWYEPIYLGGVFQLEKGDRLSAEINRPDYLDFAESGQVYFGIIAL		P01375	cytokine		8.0		f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
24980476	Immobilization of Clostridium cellulolyticum D-psicose 3-epimerase on artificial oil bodies.	The rare sugar D-psicose possesses several fundamental biological functions. D-Psicose 3-epimerase from Clostridium cellulolyticum (CC-DPEase) has considerable potential for use in D-psicose production. In this study, CC-DPEase was fused to the N terminus of oleosin, a unique structural protein of seed oil bodies and was overexpressed in Escherichia coli as a CC-DPEase-oleosin fusion protein. After reconstitution into artificial oil bodies (AOBs), refolding, purification, and immobilization of the active CC-DPEase were simultaneously accomplished. Immobilization of CC-DPEase on AOB increased the optimal temperature but decreased the optimal pH of the enzyme activity. Furthermore, the AOB-immobilized CC-DPEase had a thermal stability and a bioconversion rate similar to those of the free-form enzyme and retained &gt;500f its initial activity after five cycles of enzyme use. Thus, AOB-immobilized CC-DPEase has potential application in the production of d-psicose at a lower cost than the free-form enzyme.	2014 Jul	Tseng Chih-Wen,Liao Chien-Yi,Sun Yuanxia,Peng Chi-Chung,Tzen Jason T C,Guo Rey-Ting,Liu Je-Ruei	Journal of agricultural and food chemistry. 62(28) 6771-6	Clostridium cellulolyticumD-Psicose 3-Epimerase	MKHGIYYAYWEQEWEADYKYYIEKVAKLGFDILEIAASPLPFYSDIQINELKACAHGNGITLTVGHGPSAEQNLSSPDPDIRKNAKAFYTDLLKRLYKLDVHLIGGALYSYWPIDYTKTIDKKGDWERSVESVREVAKVAEACGVDFCLEVLNRFENYLINTAQEGVDFVKQVDHNNVKVMLDTFHMNIEEDSIGGAIRTAGSYLGHLHTGECNRKVPGRGRIPWVEIGEALADIGYNGSVVMEPFVRMGGTVGSNIKVWRDISNGADEKMLDREAQAALDFSRYVLECHKHS		B8I944	Epimerization of D-fructose at the C-3 position, producing D-psicose.	full length	7.4	4	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
25036967	Heterologous production, purification, and immunodetection of Magnaporthe oryzae avirulence protein AVR-Pia.	The avirulence gene AVR-Pia of Magnaporthe oryzae, which induces a hypersensitive reaction in rice cultivars containing the resistance gene Pia, was expressed in Escherichia coli. AVR-Pia protein was collected as inclusion bodies, denatured, and refolded. Finally, recombinant AVR-Pia (rAVR-Pia) protein was purified by column chromatography. Infiltration of rAVR-Pia triggered cell browning in the leaves of rice cultivar Aichiasahi (Pia), with accumulation of H2O2 and induction of PR1a expression in rice. On the other hand, these reactions were not observed in Shin-2 (pia) leaves after the same treatment. This observation indicated that rAVR-Pia had the function of an avirulence protein. rAVR-Pia was used for immunization of a rabbit, and anti-AVR-Pia antiserum was prepared. The specificity of this antibody was appraised by detecting native AVR-Pia in the inoculated leaf sheath extract using Western blotting in combination with immunoprecipitation. Native AVR-Pia was successfully detected, and its molecular weight was estimated to be 7.4 kDa, indicating signal peptide cleavage. Additionally, secreted native AVR-Pia was quantified as 3.7 ng/g rice sheath.	2014 Jul	Satoh Yuki,Miki Shinsuke,Ose Toyoyuki,Oikawa Azusa,Maenaka Katsumi,Terauchi Ryouhei,Asano Kozo,Sone Teruo	Bioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry. 78(4) 680-6	Antivirulence protein AVR-Pia	APARFCVYYDGHLPATRVLLMYVRIGNTATITARGHEFEVEAKDQNCKVILTNGKQAPDWLAAEPY		B9WZW9	Infiltration of rAVR-Pia triggered cell browning in the leaves of rice cultivar Aichiasahi (Pia), with accumulation of H2O2 and induction of PR1a expression in rice.an avirulence protein		8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
25053491	Bacterial expression and in vitro refolding of limited fragments of the Notch receptor and its ligands.	Prokaryotic expression of limited fragments of the Notch receptor and its ligands followed by in vitro refolding has been used for the production of the significant amounts of protein required for structure determination by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. As an illustration of the protocol for the production of these EGF-containing constructs we have focused on a limited fragment of human Notch 1 that contains three calcium-binding EGF domains, hNotch-111-13. Following characterization by the methods described here, this construct has been shown to be functionally competent in a range of assays and the structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR.	2014 Jul	Whiteman Pat,Redfield Christina,Handford Penny A	Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.). 1187 193-208	Notch 1	ECSLGANPCEHAGKCINTLGSFECQCLQGYTGPRCEIDVNECVSNPCQNDATCLDQIGEFQCICMPGYEGVHCEVNTDECASSPCLHNGRCLDKINEFQCECPTGFTGHLCQ	411-526 of Notch1	P46531	cacium binding domain of Notch1	hNotch-111–13	8.3	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f	t
25079598	The role of the carbohydrate recognition domain of placental protein 13 (PP13) in pregnancy evaluated with recombinant PP13 and the DelT221 PP13 variant.	INTRODUCTION:Placental protein 13 (PP13), a placenta specific protein, is reduced in the first trimester of pregnancy in women who subsequently develop preeclampsia. A naturally occurring PP13 deletion of thymidine at position 221 (DelT221 or truncated variant) is associated with increased frequency of severe preeclampsia. In this study we compared the full length (wildtype) PP13 and the truncated variant.METHODS:Full length PP13 or its DelT221 variant were cloned, expressed and purified from E-Coli. Both variants were administrated into pregnant rats at day 8 of pregnancy for slow release (&gt;5 days) through osmotic pumps and rat blood pressure was measured. Animals were sacrificed at day 15 or day 21 and their utero-placental vasculature was examined.RESULTS:The DelT221 variant (11 kDA) lacked exon 4 and a part of exon 3, and is short of 2 amino acids involved in the carbohydrate (CRD) binding of the wildtype (18 kDA). Unlike the wildtype PP13, purification of DelT221 variant required special refolding. PP13 specific poly- clonal antibodies recognized both PP13 and DelT221 but PP13 specific monoclonal antibodies recognized only the wildtype, indicating the loss of major epitopes. Wildtype PP13 mRNA and its respective proteins were both lower in PE patients compared to normal pregnancies. The DelT221 mutant was not found in a large Caucasian cohort. Pregnant rats exposed to wildtype or DelT221 PP13 variants had significantly lower blood pressure compared to control. The wildtype but not the DelT221 mutant caused extensive vein expansion.CONCLUSION:This study revealed the importance of PP13 in regulating blood pressure and expanding the utero-placental vasculature in pregnant rats. PP13 mutant lacking amino acids of the PP13 CRD domain fails to cause vein expansion but did reduce blood pressure. The study provides a basis for replenishing patients at risk for preeclampsia by the full length but not the truncated PP13.	2014 Aug	Sammar Marei,Nisamblatt Shahar,Gonen Ron,Huppertz Berthold,Gizurarson Sveinbjorn,Osol George,Meiri Hamutal	PloS one. 9(7) e102832	Placental protein 13		N-terminal His6 tag, 13-residue C-terminal tail (ELGTPGRPAAKLN), DelT221 Variant(aa 1-73)	Q9UHV8	carbohydrate binding		8.0	room temperature	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
25092593	Multi-variable operational characteristic studies of on-column oxidative protein refolding at high loading concentrations.	Chromatographic-based protein refolding techniques have proven to be superior to conventional dilution refolding methods, due to the higher loading concentration and simultaneous purification. Among these techniques, Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) has in particular been demonstrated as an effective method for refolding of variety of proteins. To date existing studies of protein refolding at high concentrations (&gt;1mg/mL) in SEC have primarily been conducted as single factor studies, in which a single parameter is varied to assess impact on operating performance, which does not allow for determination of the interactions of different operating parameters and optimized operating conditions. In this work a multi-variable investigation of size exclusion protein refolding at high protein concentration using lysozyme as a model protein was performed, in order to quantify the interaction of factors and optimize performance. It was observed when l-arginine is used as an additive the refolding yield becomes independent of the protein concentration and refolding buffer pH, providing that a redox couple is used to assist the reformation of disulfide bridges. Furthermore, the pore accessibility for small molecules was reduced at the presence of this additive particularly at higher protein concentrations indicating slower removal of these molecules and a possible additional mechanism of aggregation prevention. Using the subsequent optimized refolding buffer, a refolding yield of more than 90% was obtained for up to 40mg/mL loading concentration of lysozyme which has only been reported for a urea gradient SEC (8-2M) with lower equilibration and elution flow rates due to high viscosity of buffer containing high concentrations of urea.	2014 Aug	Saremirad Pegah,Wood Jeffery A,Zhang Yan,Ray Ajay K	Journal of chromatography.

25093117	Optimization of the Protocol for the Isolation and Refolding of the Extracellular Domain of HER2 Expressed in Escherichia coli.	Receptor 2 of the human epidermal growth factor (HER2/neu, c-erbB2) is a 185 kDa proto-oncogene protein characterized by an overexpression in some oncological diseases, including 300f mammary glands cancers, as well as tumors in the ovary, stomach and other organs of the human body. Since HER2- tumor status testing is the essential part of a successful cancer treatment, the expression and purification of substantial amounts of the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER2 is an important task. The production of ECD HER2 in Escherichia coli has several advantages over the use of eukaryotic expression systems, but the bulk of the recombinant product in bacteria accumulates as insoluble protein inclusion bodies. In this study, we obtained ECD HER2 in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies and elaborated a simple, efficient, and fast protocol for the solubilization, refolding, and isolation of the protein in soluble form.	2014 Aug	Dolgikh V V,Senderskiy I V,Tetz G V,Tetz V V	Acta naturae. 6(2) 106-9	Receptor 2 of the human epidermal growth factor	TQVCTGTDMKLRLPASPETHLDMLRHLYQGCQVVQGNLELTYLPTNASLSFLQDIQEVQGYVLIAHNQVRQVPLQRLRIVRGTQLFEDNYALAVLDNGDPLNNTTPVTGASPGGLRELQLRSLTEILKGGVLIQRNPQLCYQDTILWKDIFHKNNQLALTLIDTNRSRACHPCSPMCKGSRCWGESSEDCQSLTRTVCAGGCARCKGPLPTDCCHEQCAAGCTGPKHSDCLACLHFNHSGICELHCPALVTYNTDTFESMPNPEGRYTFGASCVTACPYNYLSTDVGSCTLVCPLHNQEVTAEDGTQRCEKCSKPCARVCYGLGMEHLREVRAVTSANIQEFAGCKKIFGSLAFLPESFDGDPASNTAPLQPEQLQVFETLEEITGYLYISAWPDSLPDLSVFQNLQVIRGRILHNGAYSLTLQGLGISWLGLRSLRELGSGLALIHHNTHLCFVHTVPWDQLFRNPHQALLHTANRPEDECVGEGLACHQLCARGHCWGPGPTQCVNCSQFLRGQECVEECRVLQGLPREYVNARHCLPCHPECQPQNGSVTCFGPEADQCVACAHYKDPPFCVARCPSGVKPDLSYMPIWKFPDEEGACQPCPINCTHSCVDLDDKGCPAEQRASPLT	N-termina His6 tag	P04626	tyrosine kinase	extracellular domain(23-652)	8.0		t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
25119648	Matrix-assisted refolding, purification and activity assessment using a &#39;form invariant&#39; assay for matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2).	Matrix metalloproteinases expression is used as biomarker for various cancers and associated malignancies. Since these proteinases can cleave many intracellular proteins, overexpression tends to be toxic; hence, a challenge to purify them. To overcome these limitations, we designed a protocol where full length pro-MMP2 enzyme was overexpressed in E. coli as inclusion bodies and purified using 6xHis affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions. In one step, the enzyme was purified and refolded directly on the affinity matrix under redox conditions to obtain a bioactive protein. The pro-MMP2 protein was characterized by mass spectrometry, CD spectroscopy, zymography and activity analysis using a simple in-house developed &#39;form invariant&#39; assay, which reports the total MMP2 activity independent of its various forms. The methodology yielded higher yields of bioactive protein compared to other strategies reported till date, and we anticipate that using the protocol, other toxic proteins can also be overexpressed and purified from E. coli and subsequently refolded into active form using a one step renaturation protocol.	2014 Nov	Singh Krishna Kumar,Jain Ruchi,Ramanan Harini,Saini Deepak Kumar	Molecular biotechnology. 56(12) 1121-32	Matrix Metalloproteinase 2	MEALMARGALTGPLRALCLLGCLLSHAAAAPSPIIKFPGDVAPKTDKELAVQYLNTFYGCPKESCNLFVLKDTLKKMQKFFGLPQTGDLDQNTIETMRKPRCGNPDVANYNFFPRKPKWDKNQITYRIIGYTPDLDPETVDDAFARAFQVWSDVTPLRFSRIHDGEADIMINFGRWEHGDGYPFDGKDGLLAHAFAPGTGVGGDSHFDDDELWTLGEGQVVRVKYGNADGEYCKFPFLFNGKEYNSCTDTGRSDGFLWCSTTYNFEKDGKYGFCPHEALFTMGGNAEGQPCKFPFRFQGTSYDSCTTEGRTDGYRWCGTTEDYDRDKKYGFCPETAMSTVGGNSEGAPCVFPFTFLGNKYESCTSAGRSDGKMWCATTANYDDDRKWGFCPDQGYSLFLVAAHEFGHAMGLEHSQDPGALMAPIYTYTKNFRLSQDDIKGIQELYGASPDIDLGTGPTPTLGPVTPEICKQDIVFDGIAQIRGEIFFFKDRFIWRTVTPRDKPMGPLLVATFWPELPEKIDAVYEAPQEEKAVFFAGNEYWIYSASTLERGYPKPLTSLGLPPDVQRVDAAFNWSKNKKTYIFAGDKFWRYNEVKKKMDPGFPKLIADAWNAIPDNLDAVVDLQGGGHSYFFKGAYYLKLENQSLKSVKFGSIKSDWLGC	N-terminal His6 tag	P08253	metalloendopeptidase		8.0	room temperature	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
25171321	Recombinant human voltage dependent anion selective channel isoform 3 (hVDAC3) forms pores with a very small conductance.	BACKGROUND/AIMS:Voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC), also known as eukaryotic porins, are located in the outer mitochondrial membrane and allow the flux of ions and small metabolites. While the pore-forming ability of recombinant VDAC1 and VDAC2 has been extensively studied during the last decades, a clear-cut ion conducting channel activity has not been assigned to the VDAC3 isoform. Methods : Electrophysiological characterization of the recombinant protein purified and refolded was obtained after incorporation into planar lipid bilayers.RESULTS:Here we report for the first time that recombinant hVDAC3, upon expression in E.coli and purification-refolding, shows a channel activity with a very small conductance (90 pS in 1 M KCl) with respect to the conductance of hVDAC1 (&gt;3500 pS in 1 M KCl). Purified hVDAC3 allowed the passage of both chloride and gluconate anions and did not distinguish between potassium, sodium and calcium used as cations. In contrast to VDAC1, the channel was active also at transmembrane voltages higher than +/-40 mV and displayed a relatively high open probability even at +/-80 mV. hVDAC3 was only slightly voltage-dependent, displaying a tendency to adopt lower-conductance states at positive voltages applied to the cis chamber. In accordance with the small conductance of the pore, expression of hVDAC3 in a porin-less yeast strain allowed only partial recovery of the growth under non-permissive conditions.CONCLUSION:The observed electrophysiological properties of hVDAC3 are surprisingly different from the other isoforms and are discussed in relation to the proposed physiological role of the protein in mammalian cells.	2014 Sep	Checchetto Vanessa,Reina Simona,Magrì Andrea,Szabo Ildikò,De Pinto Vito	Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology. 34(3) 842-53	Voltage Dependent Anion selective Channel isoform 3	MCNTPTYCDLGKAAKDVFNKGYGFGMVKIDLKTKSCSGVEFSTSGHAYTDTGKASGNLETKYKVCNYGLTFTQKWNTDNTLGTEISWENKLAEGLKLTLDTIFVPNTGKKSGKLKASYKRDCFSVGSNVDIDFSGPTIYGWAVLAFEGWLAGYQMSFDTAKSKLSQNNFALGYKAADFQLHTHVNDGTEFGGSIYQKVNEKIETSINLAWTAGSNNTRFGIAAKYMLDCRTSLSAKVNNASLIGLGYTQTLRPGVKLTLSALIDGKNFSAGGHKVGLGFELEA	C-terminal His6 tag	Q9Y277	voltage-gated anion channel		7.0	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

25257512	Recombinant streptavidin nanopeptamer anti-immunocomplex assay for noncompetitive detection of small analytes.	Short peptide loops selected from phage libraries can specifically recognize the formation of hapten-antibody immunocomplexes and can thus be used to develop phage anti-immunocomplex assays (PHAIA) for noncompetitive detection of small molecules. In this study, we generated recombinant chimeras by fusing anti-immunocomplex peptides selected from phage libraries to the N- or C-termini of core streptavidin and used them to setup phage-free noncompetitive assays for the herbicide clomazone (MW 240 Da). The best conditions for refolding were optimized by a high throughput screening allowing to obtain tens of mg of purified protein per liter of culture. The noncompetitive assay developed with these chimeras performed with a 50aturating concentration (SC50) of 2.2 ± 0.3 ng/mL and limit of detection (LOD) of 0.48 ng/mL. Values that are 13- and 8-fold better that those obtained for the SC50 and LOD of the competitive assay setup with the same antibody. Apart from the first demonstration that recombinant peptide-streptavidin chimeras can be used for sensitive immunodetection of small molecules with a positive readout, this new assay component is a highly standardized reagent with a defined stoichiometry, which can be used in combination with the broad option of existing biotinylated reagents offering a great versatility for the development of conventional immunoassay and biosensors. The utility of the test was demonstrated analyzing the clomazone runoff during the rice growing season in northern Uruguay.	2014 Oct	Carlomagno Mariana,Lassabe Gabriel,Rossotti Martín,González-Techera Andrés,Vanrell Lucía,González-Sapienza Gualberto	Analytical chemistry. 86(20) 10467-73	Streptavidin (STR)　Nanopeptamer	AAEAGITGTWYNQLGSTFIVTAGADGALTGTYESAVGNAESRYVLTGRYDSAPATDGSGTALGWTVAWKNNYRNAHSATTWSGQYVGGAEARINTQWLLTSGTTEANAWKSTLVGHDTFTKVKPSAAS	Streptavidine was fused with a peptide ICX11 at its N- or C- terminus.

25266561	Differential contribution of tryptophans to the folding and stability of the attachment invasion locus transmembrane β-barrel from Yersinia pestis.	Attachment invasion locus (Ail) protein of Yersinia pestis is a crucial outer membrane protein for host invasion and determines bacterial survival within the host. Despite its importance in pathogenicity, surprisingly little is known on Ail biophysical properties. We investigate the contribution of micelle concentrations and interface tryptophans on the Ail β-barrel refolding and unfolding processes. Our results reveal that barrel folding is surprisingly independent of micelle amounts, but proceeds through an on-pathway intermediate that requires the interface W42 for cooperative barrel refolding. On the contrary, the unfolding event is strongly controlled by absolute micelle concentrations. We find that upon Trp → Phe substitution, protein stabilities follow the order W149F&gt;WT&gt;W42F for the refolding, and W42F&gt;WT&gt;W149F for unfolding. W42 confers cooperativity in barrel folding, and W149 clamps the post-folded barrel structure to its micelle environment. Our analyses reveal, for the first time, that interface tryptophan mutation can indeed render greater β-barrel stability. Furthermore, hysteresis in Ail stems from differential barrel-detergent interaction strengths in a micelle concentration-dependent manner, largely mediated by W149. The kinetically stabilized Ail β-barrel has strategically positioned tryptophans to balance efficient refolding and subsequent β-barrel stability, and may be evolutionarily chosen for optimal functioning of Ail during Yersinia pathogenesis.	2014 Sep	Gupta Ankit,Zadafiya Punit,Mahalakshmi Radhakrishnan	Scientific reports. 4 6508	Attachment invasion locus protein	MEGESSISIGYAQSRVKEDGYKLDKNPRGFNLKYRYEFNNDFGVIGSFAQTRRGFEESVDGFKLIDGDFKYYSVTAGPVFRINEYVSLYGLLGAGHGKAKFSSIFGQSESRSKTSLAYGAGLQFNPHPNFVIDASYEYSKLDDVKVGTWMLGAGYRF	W42F mutant, without signal peptide	Q8D0Z7			8.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
25266561	Differential contribution of tryptophans to the folding and stability of the attachment invasion locus transmembrane β-barrel from Yersinia pestis.	Attachment invasion locus (Ail) protein of Yersinia pestis is a crucial outer membrane protein for host invasion and determines bacterial survival within the host. Despite its importance in pathogenicity, surprisingly little is known on Ail biophysical properties. We investigate the contribution of micelle concentrations and interface tryptophans on the Ail β-barrel refolding and unfolding processes. Our results reveal that barrel folding is surprisingly independent of micelle amounts, but proceeds through an on-pathway intermediate that requires the interface W42 for cooperative barrel refolding.

25309524	Refolding and purification of recombinant L-asparaginase from inclusion bodies of E. coli into active tetrameric protein.	A tetrameric protein of therapeutic importance, Escherichia coli L-asparaginase-II was expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies (IBs). Asparaginase IBs were solubilized using low concentration of urea and refolded into active tetrameric protein using pulsatile dilution method. Refolded asparaginase was purified in two steps by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatographic techniques. The recovery of bioactive asparaginase from IBs was around 50%. The melting temperature (Tm) of the purified asparaginase was found to be 64°C. The specific activity of refolded, purified asparaginase was found to be comparable to the commercial asparaginase (190 IU/mg). Enzymatic activity of the refolded asparaginase was high even at four molar urea solutions, where the IB aggregates are completely solubilized. From the comparison of chemical denaturation data and activity at different concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride, it was observed that dissociation of monomeric units precedes the complete loss of helical secondary structures. Protection of the existing native-like protein structure during solubilization of IB aggregates with 4 M urea improved the propensity of monomer units to form oligomeric structure. Our mild solubilization technique retaining native-like structures, improved recovery of asparaginase in bioactive tetrameric form.	2014 Oct	Upadhyay Arun K,Singh Anupam,Mukherjee K J,Panda Amulya K	Frontiers in microbiology. 5 486	L-asparaginase-II	LPNITILATGGTIAGGGDSATKSNYTVGKVGVENLVNAVPQLKDIANVKGEQVVNIGSQDMNDNVWLTLAKKINTDCDKTDGFVITHGTDTMEETAYFLDLTVKCDKPVVMVGAMRPSTSMSADGPFNLYNAVVTAADKASANRGVLVVMNDTVLDGRDVTKTNTTDVATFKSVNYGPLGYIHNGKIDYQRTPARKHTSDTPFDVSKLNELPKVGIVYNYANASDLPAKALVDAGYDGIVSAGVGNGNLYKSVFDTLATAAKTGTAVVRSSRVPTGATTQDAEVDDAKYGFVASGTLNPQKARVLLQLALTQTKDPQQIQQIFNQY	without signal peptide	P00805	hydrolase		8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	t	f	f	f
25313668	Structural characteristic of the initial unfolded state on refolding determines catalytic efficiency of the folded protein in presence of osmolytes.	Osmolytes are low molecular weight organic molecules accumulated by organisms to assist proper protein folding, and to provide protection to the structural integrity of proteins under denaturing stress conditions. It is known that osmolyte-induced protein folding is brought by unfavorable interaction of osmolytes with the denatured/unfolded states. The interaction of osmolyte with the native state does not significantly contribute to the osmolyte-induced protein folding. We have therefore investigated if different denatured states of a protein (generated by different denaturing agents) interact differently with the osmolytes to induce protein folding. We observed that osmolyte-assisted refolding of protein obtained from heat-induced denatured state produces native molecules with higher enzyme activity than those initiated from GdmCl- or urea-induced denatured state indicating that the structural property of the initial denatured state during refolding by osmolytes determines the catalytic efficiency of the folded protein molecule. These conclusions have been reached from the systematic measurements of enzymatic kinetic parameters (Km and kcat), thermodynamic stability (Tm and ΔHm) and secondary and tertiary structures of the folded native proteins obtained from refolding of various denatured states (due to heat-, urea- and GdmCl-induced denaturation) of RNase-A in the presence of various osmolytes.	2014 Oct	Warepam Marina,Sharma Gurumayum Suraj,Dar Tanveer Ali,Khan Md Khurshid Alam,Singh Laishram Rajendrakumar	PloS one. 9(10) e109408	Ribonuclease-A	KETAAAKFERQHMDSSTSAASSSNYCNQMMKSRNLTKDRCKPVNTFVHESLADVQAVCSQKNVACKNGQTNCYQSYSTMSITDCRETGSSKYPNCAYKTTQANKHIIVACEGNPYVPVHFDASV	without signal peptide	P61823	Endonuclease, Hydrolase, Nuclease		7.0	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f

25352331	Refolding of a fully functional flavivirus methyltransferase revealed that S-adenosyl methionine but not S-adenosyl homocysteine is copurified with flavivirus methyltransferase.	Methylation of flavivirus RNA is vital for its stability and translation in the infected host cell. This methylation is mediated by the flavivirus methyltransferase (MTase), which methylates the N7 and 2&#39;-O positions of the viral RNA cap by using S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) as a methyl donor. In this report, we demonstrate that SAM, in contrast to the reaction by-product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, which was assumed previously, is copurified with the Dengue (DNV) and West Nile virus MTases produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli). This endogenous SAM can be removed by denaturation and refolding of the MTase protein. The refolded MTase of DNV serotype 3 (DNV3) displays methylation activity comparable to native enzyme, and its crystal structure at 2.1 Å is almost identical to that of native MTase. We characterized the binding of Sinefungin (SIN), a previously described SAM-analog inhibitor of MTase function, to the native and refolded DNV3 MTase by isothermal titration calorimetry, and found that SIN binds to refolded MTase with more than 16 times the affinity of SIN binding to the MTase purified natively. Moreover, we show that SAM is also copurified with other flavivirus MTases, indicating that purification by refolding may be a generally applicable tool for studying flavivirus MTase inhibition.	2014 Dec	Brecher Matthew B,Li Zhong,Zhang Jing,Chen Hui,Lin Qishan,Liu Binbin,Li Hongmin	Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society. 24(1) 117-28	flavivirus methyltransferase	GETLGEKWKKKLNQLSRKEFDLYKKSGITEVDRTEAKEGLKRGETTHHAVSRGSAKLQWFVERNMVIPEGRVIDLGCGRGGWSYYCAGLKKVTEVRGYTKGGPGHEEPVPMSTYGWNIVKLMSGKDVFYLPPEKCDTLLCDIGESSPSPTVEESRTIRVLKMVEPWLKNNQFCIKVLNPYMPTVIEHLERLQRKHGGMLVRNPLSRNSTHEMYWISNGTGNIVSSVNMVSRLLLNRFTMTHRRPTIEKDVDLGAGTR	N-terminal His6 tag	C1KBQ3	methyltransferase	UNP residues 2491-2752	8.0	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	t	t
25370824	New strategy for high-level expression and purification of biologically active monomeric TGF-β1/C77S in Escherichia coli.	Mature transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-β1) is a homodimeric protein with a single disulfide bridge between Cys77 on the respective monomers. The synthetic DNA sequence encoding the mature human TGF-β1/C77S (further termed TGF-β1m) was cloned into plasmid pET-32a downstream to the gene of fusion partner thioredoxin (Trx) immediately after the DNA sequence encoding enteropeptidase recognition site. High-level expression (~1.5 g l(-1)) of Trx/TGF-β1m fusion was achieved in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain mainly in insoluble form. The fusion was solubilized and refolded in glutathione redox system in the presence of zwitterionic detergent CHAPS. After refolding, Trx/TGF-β1m fusion was cleaved by enteropeptidase, and the carrier protein of TGF-β1m was separated from thioredoxin on Ni-NTA agarose. Separation of monomeric molecules from the noncovalently bounded oligomers was done using cation-exchange chromatography. The structure of purified TGF-β1m was confirmed by circular dichroism analysis. The developed technology allowed purifying biologically active tag-free monomeric TGF-β1m from bacteria with a yield of about 2.8 mg from 100 ml cell culture. The low-cost and easy purification steps allow considering that our proposed preparation of recombinant monomeric TGF-β1 could be employed for in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as for therapeutic intervention.	2015 Jan	Kim Yana V,Gasparian Marine E,Bocharov Eduard V,Chertkova Rita V,Tkach Elena N,Dolgikh Dmitry A,Kirpichnikov Mikhail P	Molecular biotechnology. 57(2) 160-71	Transforming growth factor beta 1	ALDTNYCFSSTEKNCCVRQLYIDFRKDLGWKWIHEPKGYHANFCLGPCPYIWSLDTQYSKVLALYNQHNPGASAAPSCVPQALEPLPIVYYVGRKPKVEQLSNMIVRSCKCS	N-terminal thioredoxin and His6 tag, C355S mutant	P01137	Growth Factor	aa.279-390	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f
25378200	Refolding and simultaneous purification of recombinant human proinsulin from inclusion bodies on protein-folding liquid-chromatography columns.	Protein-folding liquid chromatography (PFLC) is an effective and scalable method for protein renaturation with simultaneous purification. However, it has been a challenge to fully refold inclusion bodies in a PFLC column. In this work, refolding with simultaneous purification of recombinant human proinsulin (rhPI) from inclusion bodies from Escherichia coli were investigated using the surface of stationary phases in immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) and high-performance size-exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The results indicated that both the ligand structure on the surface of the stationary phase and the composition of the mobile phase (elution buffer) influenced refolding of rhPI. Under optimized chromatographic conditions, the mass recoveries of IMAC column and HPSEC column were 77.8 and 56.8% with purifies of 97.6 and 93.7%, respectively. These results also indicated that the IMAC column fails to refold rhPI, and the HPSEC column enables efficient refolding of rhPI with a low-urea gradient-elution method. The refolded rhPI was characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy. The molecular weight of the converted human insulin was further confirmed with SDS-18% PAGE, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and the biological activity assay by HP-RPLC.	2015 Apr	Yuan Jie,Zhou Huifang,Yang Yicong,Li Weimin,Wan Yi,Wang Lili	Biomedical chromatography : BMC. 29(5) 777-82	proinsulin	FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKTRREAEDLQVGQVELGGGPGAGSLQPLALEGSLQKRGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN	witout signal peptide, His tag protein	P01308	hormone activity		6.5		f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
25437069	Production of in-vitro refolded and highly antigenic SAG1 for development of a sensitive and specific Toxoplasma IgG ELISA.	Recombinant antigens are increasingly applied to replace native antigens in serological tests. Surface antigen 1 (SAG1) is a highly immunogenic antigen and probably represents the most explored and used antigen of Toxoplasma gondii for development of serological test kits. The presence of six disulfide bridges in its structure makes SAG1 a highly conformational protein. In fact, antigenicity of SAG1 is greatly dependent on proper disulfide bonding and folding. In-vitro refolding of SAG1 inclusion bodies, produced in Escherichia coli, was reported to result in soluble and antigenic protein. We produced SAG1 in E. coli and highly purified it by a single denaturing immobilized metal affinity chromatography. Refolding of denatured SAG1 was performed by (a) dialysis in the presence of reduced/oxidized glutathione, (b) drop-wise dilution and (c) drop-wise dilution in the presence of CuSo4. Refolding in the presence of oxido-shuffling reagent was much more efficient in producing presumably correctly-folded and highly antigenic SAG1 as demonstrated by non-reducing SDS-gel electrophoresis, ELISA, Western blotting and reversed-phase HPLC. An IgG ELISA developed using SAG1 refolded in the presence of oxido-shuffling reagent displayed high sensitivity and specificity for detection of Toxoplasma IgG antibodies in pregnant women.	2015 Feb	Allahyari Mojgan,Mohabati Reyhaneh,Babaie Jalal,Amiri Samira,Siavashani Zahra Jafari,Zare Mehrak,Sadeghiani Ghazaleh,Golkar Majid	Journal of immunological methods. 416 157-66	surface antigen 1 (SAG1)	PPLVANQVVTCPDKKSTAAVILTPTENHFTLKCPKTALTEPPTLAYSPNRQICPAGTTSSCTSKAVTLSSLIPEAEDSWWTGDSASLDTAGIKLTVPIEKFPVTTQTFVVGCIKGDDAQSCMVTVTVQARASSVVNNVARCSYGADSTLGPVKLSAEGPTTMTLVCGKDGVKVPQDNNQYCSGTTLTGCNEKSFKDILPKLTENPWQGNASSDKGATLTIKKEAFPAESKSVIIGCTGGSPEKHHCTVKLEFAGAAGSAKSA	49-311	P13664	a highly immunogenic antigen	N- and C-terminally truncated protein	9.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
25447707	The zymogen of plasmepsin V from Plasmodium falciparum is enzymatically active.	Plasmepsin V, a membrane-bound aspartic protease present in Plasmodium falciparum, is involved in the export of malaria parasite effector proteins into host erythrocytes and therefore is a potential target for antimalarial drug development. The present study reports the bacterial recombinant expression and initial characterization of zymogenic and mature plasmepsin V. A 484-residue truncated form of proplasmepsin (Glu37-Asn521) was fused to a fragment of thioredoxin and expressed as inclusion bodies. Refolding conditions were optimized and zymogen was processed into a mature form via cleavage at the Asn80-Ala81 peptide bond. Mature plasmepsin V exhibited a pH optimum of 5.5-7.0 with Km and kcat of 4.6 μM and 0.24s(-1), respectively, at pH 6.0 using the substrate DABCYL-LNKRLLHETQ-E(EDANS). Furthermore, the prosegment of proplasmepsin V was shown to be nonessential for refolding and inhibition. Unexpectedly, unprocessed proplasmepsin V was enzymatically active with slightly reduced substrate affinity (∼ 2-fold), and similar pH optimum as well as turnover compared to the mature form. Both zymogenic and mature plasmepsin V were partially inhibited by pepstatin A as well as several KNI aspartic protease inhibitors while certain metals strongly inhibited activity. Overall, the present study provides the first report on the nonessentiality of the prosegment for plasmepsin V folding and activity, and therefore, subsequent characterization of its structure-function relationships of both zymogen and mature forms in the development of novel inhibitors with potential antimalarial activities is warranted.	2014 Dec	Xiao Huogen,Bryksa Brian C,Bhaumik Prasenjit,Gustchina Alla,Kiso Yoshiaki,Yao Shao Q,Wlodawer Alexander,Yada Rickey Y	Molecular and biochemical parasitology. 197(1-2) 56-63	plasmepsin V	MNNYFLRKENFFILFCFVFVSIFFVSNVTIIKCNNVENKIDNVGKKIENVGKKIGDMENKNDNVENKNDNVGNKNDNVKNASSDLYKYKLYGDIDEYAYYFLDIDIGKPSQRISLILDTGSSSLSFPCNGCKDCGIHMEKPYNLNYSKTSSILYCNKSNCPYGLKCVGNKCEYLQSYCEGSQIYGFYFSDIVTLPSYNNKNKISFEKLMGCHMHEESLFLHQQATGVLGFSLTKPNGVPTFVDLLFKHTPSLKPIYSICVSEHGGELIIGGYEPDYFLSNQKEKQKMDKSDNNSSNKGNVSIKLKNNDKNDDEENNSKDVIVSNNVEDIVWQAITRKYYYYIKIYGLDLYGTNIMDKKELDMLVDSGSTFTHIPENIYNQINYYLDILCIHDMTNIYEINKRLKLTNESLNKPLVYFEDFKTALKNIIQNENLCIKIVDGVQCWKSLENLPNLYITLSNNYKMIWKPSSYLYKKESFWCKGLEKQVNNKPILGLTFFKNKQVIFDLQQNQIAFIESKCPSNLTSSRPRTFNEYREKENIFLKVSYINLYCLWLLLALTILLSLILYVRKMFYMDYFPLSDQNKSPIQEST	484-residue truncated form of pro-plasmepsin (Glu37–Asn521) was fused to a fragment of thioredoxin and expressed as inclusion bodies.

25447898	A ripening associated peroxidase from papaya having a role in defense and lignification: heterologous expression and in-silico and in-vitro experimental validation.	Fruit ripening associated full length cDNA of a peroxidase from papaya was cloned and heterologously expressed. The expressed peroxidase was activated by in-vitro re-folding in the presence of hemin and calcium. The purified recombinant peroxidase exhibited broad substrate affinity in the order of o-dianisidine&gt;pyrogallol&gt;guaiacol and was found to be a homotetramer of 155kDa with each subunit having a size of 38kDa. The basis of the distinctive preferences for various substrates was investigated through in-silico molecular modeling approaches. Thus, when the modeled papaya peroxidase-heme complex was docked with these substrates, the in-silico binding efficiency was found to be in agreement with those of wet lab results with the involvement of Arg37, Phe40, His41, Pro137, Asn138, His139, His167, and Phe239 as the common interacting residues in all the cases. However, the binding of the different substrates were found to be associated with conformational changes in the peroxidase. Thus, in the case of o-dianisidine (the most efficient substrate), the protein was folded in the most compact fashion when compared to guaiacol (the least efficient substrate). Protein function annotation analyses revealed that the papaya peroxidase may have biological roles in oxidation-reduction processes, stresses, defense responses etc. In order to further validate its role in lignifications, the papaya peroxidase was compared with a lignin biosynthetic peroxidase from Leucaena leucocephala, a tree legume. Thus, based on 3D structure superimposition and docking, both peroxidases exhibited a great extent of similarity suggesting the papaya peroxidase having a role in lignification (defense response) too. The predicted functions of papaya peroxidase in defense response and lignification were further validated experimentally using qRT-PCR analyses and measurement of oxidation of coniferyl alcohol.	2014 Dec	Pandey Veda P,Dwivedi Upendra N	Gene. 555(2) 438-47	peroxidase	MGTKNRRCCFTFIFLLLLLIFHFHTGKSDLELVYYVRESFHRAEEIIKQEVIKLYYKHGNTAVSWVRRSFHDCVVKSCDASLLLETMNGIRSEQESERSFGMRNFKYVETIKDALEKECPLTVSCADVVALSARDIPNHLGGPRIEMKTFRKDSKESYISEVELSAHNVGRVHCVNLVRFKSIGIDVEGTVALLGAHSVGCVTFDPLPRRLYPTVNPTWDPEYAEYIKGRCPTFDPDPFFILYARNDRETPMILDNMYYKNILNHEGLFFIDQQLAFDPTTTPFVEKMAADNGYFHDQFVRAIQLLFEINPLTNDQGEVRKSRFVNSN		X5GE19	peroxidase	full-length	7.5	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
25448595	Investigation on solubilization protocols in the refolding of the thioredoxin TsnC from Xylella fastidiosa by high hydrostatic pressure approach.	The lack of efficient refolding methodologies must be overcome to take full advantage of the fact that bacteria express high levels of aggregated recombinant proteins. High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) impairs intermolecular hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, dissociating aggregates, which makes HHP a useful tool to solubilize proteins for subsequent refolding. A process of refolding was set up by using as a model TsnC, a thioredoxin that catalyzes the disulfide reduction to a dithiol, a useful indication of biological activity. The inclusion bodies (IB) were dissociated at 2.4 kbar. The effect of incubation of IB suspensions at 1-800 bar, the guanidine hydrochloride concentration, the oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratios, and the additives in the refolding buffer were analyzed. To assess the yields of fully biologically active protein obtained for each tested condition, it was crucial to analyze both the TsnC solubilization yield and its enzymatic activity. Application of 2.4 kbar to the IB suspension in the presence of 9 mM GSH, 1mM GSSG, 0.75 M guanidine hydrochloride, and 0.5M arginine with subsequent incubation at 1 bar furnished high refolding yield (81%). The experience gained in this study shall help to establish efficient HHP-based protein refolding processes for other proteins.	2014 Dec	Lemke Laura Simoni,Chura-Chambi Rosa Maria,Rodrigues Daniella,Cussiol Jose Renato Rosa,Malavasi Natalia Vallejo,Alegria Thiago Geronimo Pires,Netto Luis Eduardo Soares,Morganti Ligia	Protein expression and purification. 106 72-7	TsnC	MSDYVLHVSDANFDAVVLLSDQPVLVDFWAKWCSPCKIISTLLDDLAQSYKGRLKIAKVDIDENRALAIKYHVCSIPMLLLFKDGQVQITQIGAVGKGRLTQMIDKVLANTDS		Q9PA22	disulfide reductase	full length	8.0		t	t	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

Defining the span of the transmembrane region, a key requirement to ensure correct folding, stability and function of bacterial outer membrane β-barrels, is assisted by the amphipathic property of tryptophan. We demonstrate the unique and distinctive properties of the interface Trp76 and Trp140 of outer membrane protein X, and map their positional relevance to the refolding process, barrel formation and the resulting stability in dodecylphosphocholine micelles. The solvent-exposed Trp76 displays a rigid interfacial localization, whereas Trp140 is relatively micelle-solvated and contributes to barrel folding and global OmpX stability. Kinetic contribution to OmpX stability is influenced by the two tryptophans. Differential associations of the indoles with the detergent milieu therefore contribute to micelle-assisted β-barrel folding and concomitant OmpX stability.	2015 Jan	Chaturvedi Deepti,Mahalakshmi Radhakrishnan	FEBS letters. 588(23) 4464-71	outer membrane protein X	ATSTVTGGYAQSDAQGQMNKMGGFNLKYRYEEDNSPLGVIGSFTYTEKSRTASSGDYNKNQYYGITAGPAYRINDWASIYGVVGVGYGKFQTTEYPTYKHDTSDYGFSYGAGLQFNPMENVALDFSYEQSRIRSVDVGTWIAGVGYRF	without signal peptide	P0A917			9.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f

Defining the span of the transmembrane region, a key requirement to ensure correct folding, stability and function of bacterial outer membrane β-barrels, is assisted by the amphipathic property of tryptophan.

25454139	Oxidative protein refolding on size exclusion chromatography at high loading concentrations: fundamental studies and mathematical modeling.	Size exclusion chromatography has been demonstrated as an effective method for refolding a variety of proteins. However, to date process development mainly relies on laboratory experimentation of individual factors. A robust model is essential for high-throughput process screening and optimization of systems to provide higher productivity and refolding yield. In this work, a detailed kinetic scheme of oxidative refolding of a model protein (lysozyme) has been investigated to predict the refolding results in SEC. Non-reactive native, quenched and equilibrium studies were conducted to obtain the model parameters for the species formed during refolding of denatured/reduced lysozyme. The model was tested in various operating conditions, such as: protein loading concentration, injection volume, flow rate and composition of refolding buffer with and without the use of l-arginine additive. An apparent two-state mechanism was found adequate to describe refolding of lysozyme on SEC for the operating condition tested in this work. Furthermore, using low concentration of l-arginine combined with urea as common aggregation suppressor additives showed insignificant change in kinetics of refolding of lysozyme on SEC. However, addition of l-arginine changed mass transfer properties of some of the species formed in refolding reaction which was considered in the model to accurately predict the result of refolding on SEC.	2014 Dec	Saremirad Pegah,Wood Jeffery A,Zhang Yan,Ray Ajay K	Journal of chromatography.

25461798	Interaction of arginine with protein during refolding process probed by amide H/D exchange mass spectrometry and isothermal titration calorimetry.	Arginine has been widely used as low molecular weight additive to promote protein refolding by suppressing aggregate formation. However, methods to investigate the role of arginine in protein refolding are often limited on protein&#39;s global conformational properties. Here, hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) was used to study the effects of arginine on recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) refolding at the scale of peptide mapping. It was found that deuteration levels of rhG-CSF refolded with arginine was higher than that without arginine during the whole refolding process, but they became almost the same when the refolding reached equilibrium. This phenomenon indicated that arginine could protect some amide deuterium atoms from being exchanged with hydrogen, but the protection diminished gradually along with refolding proceeding. Enzymatic digestion revealed six particular peptides of 16-47, 72-84, 84-93, 114-124, 145-153 and 154-162 were mainly responsible for the deuteration, and all of them dominantly located in protein&#39;s α-helix domain. Furthermore, thermodynamics analysis by isothermal titration calorimetry provided direct evidence that arginine could only react with denatured and partially refolded rhG-CSF. Taking all of the results together, we suggest that arginine suppresses protein aggregation by a reversible combination. At the initial refolding stage, arginine could combine with the denatured protein mainly through hydrogen bonding. Subsequently, arginine is gradually excluded from protein with protein&#39;s native conformation recovering.	2014 Dec	Zhao Dawei,Liu Yongdong,Zhang Guifeng,Zhang Chun,Li Xiunan,Wang Qingqing,Shi Hong,Su Zhiguo	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1854(1) 39-45	rhG-CSF(recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor)	MAGPATQSPMKLMALQLLLWHSALWTVQEATPLGPASSLPQSFLLKCLEQVRKIQGDGAALQEKLCATYKLCHPEELVLLGHSLGIPWAPLSSCPSQALQLAGCLSQLHSGLFLYQGLLQALEGISPELGPTLDTLQLDVADFATTIWQQMEELGMAPALQPTQGAMPAFASAFQRRAGGVLVASHLQSFLEVSYRVLRHLAQP	full length	P09919	cytokine	full length	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
25462803	Expression and refolding of mite allergen pro-Der f1 from inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli.	House dust mite (Dermatophagoides farinae) allergen Der f1 is one of the most important indoor allergens associated with asthma, eczema and allergic rhinitis in humans. Therefore, sufficient quantities of Der f1 cysteine protease to be used for both experimental and therapeutic purposes are very much needed. Using recombinant DNA technology, high expression rates of cysteine proteases were obtained. The cDNA sequence encoding pro-Der f1 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli using the T7 based expression vector pET-44a and induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at a final concentration of 0.2mM. Recombinant pro-Der f1 (pro-rDer f1) was expressed as an inclusion body and the isolated protease was solubilized, refolded and purified. The protease activities and IgE reactivities of pro-rDer f1 that were refolded by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) were higher than those obtained by dilution. The pair of pro-rDer f1 polypeptides produced by this method could be used for more effective and safer allergen-specific immunotherapy or to produce enzymatically and immunologically active Der f1 for diagnostic testing and deciphering of immunotherapy mechanisms.	2015 Mar	Ling Chunfang,Zhang Junyan,Chen Huifang,Zou Zehong,Lai He,Zhang Jianguo,Lin Deqiu,Tao Ailin	Protein expression and purification. 109 93-8	pro-Der f1	MKFVLAIASLLVLSTVYARPASIKTFEEFKKAFNKNYATVEEEEVARKNFLESLKYVEANKGAINHLSDLSLDEFKNRYLMSAEAFEQLKTQFDLNAETSACRINSVNVPSELDLRSLRTVTPIRMQGGCGSCWAFSGVAATESAYLAYRNTSLDLSEQELVDCASQHGCHGDTIPRGIEYIQQNGVVEERSYPYVAREQRCRRPNSQHYGISNYCQIYPPDVKQIREALTQTHTAIAVIIGIKDLRAFQHYDGRTIIQHDNGYQPNYHAVNIVGYGSTQGDDYWIVRNSWDTTWGDSGYGYFQAGNNLMMIEQYPYVVIM		P16311	cysteine-protease	Full length	8.6		t	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
25462804	Expression, refolding, purification and crystallization of the sensory domain of the TlpC chemoreceptor from Helicobacter pylori for structural studies.	Helicobacter pylori infections are associated with gastritis, duodenal and gastric ulcers and gastric adenocarcinoma. Bacterial chemotaxis, mediated by four different chemoreceptors (also termed transducer-like proteins (Tlp)), plays an important role in initial colonization and development of disease. Chemoreceptor sensory domains of H. pylori share no significant sequence similarity with those of Escherichia coli or any other non-Epsilonproteobacteria. The structural basis of how chemical signals are recognized by chemoreceptors of H. pylori is poorly understood mainly due to the lack of a robust procedure to purify their sensory domains in a soluble form. This study reports a method for extraction of the periplasmic sensory domain of transducer-like protein C (TlpC) from inclusion bodies and refolding to yield 5mg pure crystallizable protein per 1l of bacterial culture. Purified protein was monomeric in solution by size-exclusion chromatography and folded according to the circular dichroism spectrum. Crystals have been grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method using PEG 4000 as a precipitating agent. The crystals belonged to space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a=189.3, b=103.2, c=61.8Å, β=98.3. A complete X-ray diffraction data set has been collected to 2.2 Å resolution using cryocooling conditions and synchrotron radiation. Self-rotation function and Matthews coefficient calculations suggest that the asymmetric unit contains three monomers.	2014 Dec	Liu Yu Chih,Roujeinikova Anna	Protein expression and purification. 107 29-34	transducer-like protein C（TlpC）	ESVLQSQATELLQKKAQLVSFKIQGIIKRIFIGANTLEKFLSDENSAINDTLKRRMLSEFLLANPHVLLVSTIYTNDNERVITAMSMDSKIAYPNTTLNENMINQIHSLKSITRSDPYYKEVNGDKIYGMDITLPLTGKNQNIIGALNFFLNIDAFYTDVIGQKKSNTFLMGKDGRLLINPNREIQDKILSAINPDRRVAKAVEYYNQNEAGTLSYHSLSGNTETFLAIQPFDFFEEKGNNGNHWRWAIGKYVNKSLVFKEATN	34-297	C7BXY1	playing an important role in initial colonization and development of disease	Chemoreceptor sensory domain	8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f
25462808	Expression, purification and renaturation of truncated human integrin β1 from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli.	Integrins are a family of transmembrane receptors and among their members, integrin β1 is one of the best known. It plays a very important role in cell adhesion/migration and in cancer metastasis. Preparation of integrin β1 has a great potential value especially in studies focused on its function. To this end, recombinant plasmids were constructed containing DNA segments representing 454 amino acids of the N-terminal of integrin β1. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichiacoli BL21 (DE3) cells and after induction by isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), the recombinant protein (molecular weight: 53 kD) was expressed, mainly in the form of inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized by 8M urea solution then purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein was renatured by a stepwise dialysis and finally dissolved in phosphate buffered saline. The final yield was approximately 5.4 mg/L of culture and the purity of the renatured recombinant protein was greater than 98% as assessed by SDS-PAGE. The integrity of the protein was shown by Western blot using monoclonal antibodies against his-tag and integrin β1. Its secondary structure was verified as native by circular dichroism spectra and the bioactivity of the recombinant protein was displayed through the conformation switch under Mn(2+) stimulation.	2014 Dec	Shi Tonglin,Zhang Lichao,Li Zhuoyu,Newton Ian P,Zhang Quanbin	Protein expression and purification. 107 13-9	human integrin β1	MNLQPIFWIGLISSVCCVFAQTDENRCLKANAKSCGECIQAGPNCGWCTNSTFLQEGMPTSARCDDLEALKKKGCPPDDIENPRGSKDIKKNKNVTNRSKGTAEKLKPEDITQIQPQQLVLRLRSGEPQTFTLKFKRAEDYPIDLYYLMDLSYSMKDDLENVKSLGTDLMNEMRRITSDFRIGFGSFVEKTVMPYISTTPAKLRNPCTSEQNCTSPFSYKNVLSLTNKGEVFNELVGKQRISGNLDSPEGGFDAIMQVAVCGSLIGWRNVTRLLVFSTDAGFHFAGDGKLGGIVLPNDGQCHLENNMYTMSHYYDYPSIAHLVQKLSENNIQTIFAVTEEFQPVYKELKNLIPKSAVGTLSANSSNVIQLIIDAYNSLSSEVILENGKLSEGVTISYKSYCKNGVNGTGENGRKCSNISIGDEVQFEISITSNKCPKKDSDSFKIRPLGFTEEV		P05556	important in cell adhesion/migration and in cancer metastasis	head piece (ITGB1-head)	8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
25462813	Efficient in vitro refolding and functional characterization of recombinant human liver carboxylesterase (CES1) expressed in E. coli.	Human liver carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) plays a critical role in the hydrolysis of various ester- and amide-containing molecules, including active metabolites, drugs and prodrugs. However, it has been problematic to express recombinant CES1 in bacterial expression systems due to low solubility, with the CES1 protein being mainly expressed in inclusion bodies, accompanied by insufficient purity issues. In this study, we report an efficient in vitro method for refolding recombinant CES1 from inclusion bodies. A one-step purification with an immobilized-metal affinity column was utilized to purify His-tagged recombinant CES1. Conveniently, both denaturant and imidazole can be removed while the enzyme is refolded via buffer exchange, a dilution method. We show that the refolding of recombinant CES1 was successful in Tris-HCl at pH 7.5 containing a combination of 1 0lycerol and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, whereas a mixture of other additives (trehalose, sorbitol and sucrose) and β-mercaptoethanol failed to recover a functional protein. His-tagged recombinant CES1 retains its biological activity after refolding and can be used directly without removing the fusion tag. Altogether, our results provide an alternative method for obtaining a substantial amount of functionally active protein, which is advantageous for further investigations such as structural and functional studies.	2014 Dec	Boonyuen Usa,Promnares Kamoltip,Junkree Suwapat,Day Nichloas P J,Imwong Mallika	Protein expression and purification. 107 68-75	liver carboxylesterase 1	HPSSPPVVDTVHGKVLGKFVSLEGFAQPVAIFLGIPFAKPPLGPLRFTPPQPAEPWSFVKNATSYPPMCTQDPKAGQLLSELFTNRKENIPLKLSEDCLYLNIYTPADLTKKNRLPVMVWIHGGGLMVGAASTYDGLALAAHENVVVVTIQYRLGIWGFFSTGDEHSRGNWGHLDQVAALRWVQDNIASFGGNPGSVTIFGESAGGESVSVLVLSPLAKNLFHRAISESGVALTSVLVKKGDVKPLAEQIAITAGCKTTTSAVMVHCLRQKTEEELLETTLKMKFLSLDLQGDPRESQPLLGTVIDGMLLLKTPEELQAERNFHTVPYMVGINKQEFGWLIPMQLMSYPLSEGQLDQKTAMSLLWKSYPLVCIAKELIPEATEKYLGGTDDTVKKKDLFLDLIADVMFGVPSVIVARNHRDAGAPTYMYEFQYRPSFSSDMKPKTVIGDHGDELFSVFGAPFLKEGASEEEIRLSKMVMKFWANFARNGNPNGEGLPHWPEYNQKEGYLQIGANTQAAQKLKDKEVAFWTNLFAKKAVEKPPQTEHIEL	isoform 2, omitting first 19 amino acids, N-terminal His tag	P23141	Hydrolase, Serine esterase		7.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	t	f	f	f

The studies were carried out in an aqueous medium (pH 7.4) using dynamic light scattering (DLS), circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopy. A perusal of DLS data indicates that against the native hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 4.3nm in SSA, 3.9nm in PSA and 3.5nm in RSA, the Rh of the said proteins, when refolding is attempted by simple dilution, increases to 21.7nm, 36.6nm and 37.2nm, respectively. Hydrodynamic radii very near to the native protein, i.e., 4.0nm, 4.1nm and 4.4nm for RSA, PSA and SSA respectively, is obtained on the sequential addition of G5 and methyl-β-cyclodextrin to the denatured protein. Circular dichroism studies corroborate with the DLS data. The results obtained from the multi-technique approach are ascribed to the presence of two charged head-groups and two hydrocarbon tails in the gemini surfactants resulting in a very strong electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. Based on the present study it is suggested that the gemini surfactants may be utilized in the protein refolding studies and thus may address one of the most pressing demand of biotechnology industry for the development of efficient and inexpensive folding aides.	2014 Dec	Gull Nuzhat,Khan Javed Masood,Ishtikhar Mohd,Qadeer Atiyatul,Khan Rehan Ajmal,Gul Mudasir,Khan Rizwan Hasan	Journal of colloid and interface science. 439 170-6	Sheep serum albumin, SSA	MKWVTFISLLLLFSSAYSRGVFRRDTHKSEIAHRFNDLGEENFQGLVLIAFSQYLQQCPFDEHVKLVKELTEFAKTCVADESHAGCDKSLHTLFGDELCKVATLRETYGDMADCCEKQEPERNECFLNHKDDSPDLPKLKPEPDTLCAEFKADEKKFWGKYLYEVARRHPYFYAPELLYYANKYNGVFQECCQAEDKGACLLPKIDAMREKVLASSARQRLRCASIQKFGERALKAWSVARLSQKFPKADFTDVTKIVTDLTKVHKECCHGDLLECADDRADLAKYICDHQDALSSKLKECCDKPVLEKSHCIAEVDKDAVPENLPPLTADFAEDKEVCKNYQEAKDVFLGSFLYEYSRRHPEYAVSVLLRLAKEYEATLEDCCAKEDPHACYATVFDKLKHLVDEPQNLIKKNCELFEKHGEYGFQNALIVRYTRKAPQVSTPTLVEISRSLGKVGTKCCAKPESERMPCTEDYLSLILNRLCVLHEKTPVSEKVTKCCTESLVNRRPCFSDLTLDETYVPKPFDEKFFTFHADICTLPDTEKQIKKQTALVELLKHKPKATDEQLKTVMENFVAFVDKCCAADDKEGCFVLEGPKLVASTQAALA		P14639	the regulation of the colloidal osmotic pressure of blood.				t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f

25463190	Secondary structural changes in guanidinium hydrochloride denatured mammalian serum albumins and protective effect of small amounts of cationic gemini surfactant pentanediyl-α,ω-bis(cetyldimethylammonium bromide) and methyl-β-cyclodextrin: A spectroscopic study.	In the present study the cationic gemini surfactant assisted refolding of guanidinium hydrochloride (GdCl) denatured mammalian serum albumins viz. sheep serum albumin (SSA), rat serum albumin (RSA) and porcine serum albumin (PSA) using a combination of cationic gemini surfactants, pentanediyl-α,ω-bis(cetyldimethylammonium bromide) (C16H33(CH3)2N(+)-(CH2)5-N(+)(CH3)2C16H33)⋅2Br(-) designated as G5 and methyl-β-cyclodextrin in the artificial chaperone assisted two step method, is attempted. The studies were carried out in an aqueous medium (pH 7.4) using dynamic light scattering (DLS), circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopy. A perusal of DLS data indicates that against the native hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 4.3nm in SSA, 3.9nm in PSA and 3.5nm in RSA, the Rh of the said proteins, when refolding is attempted by simple dilution, increases to 21.7nm, 36.6nm and 37.2nm, respectively. Hydrodynamic radii very near to the native protein, i.e., 4.0nm, 4.1nm and 4.4nm for RSA, PSA and SSA respectively, is obtained on the sequential addition of G5 and methyl-β-cyclodextrin to the denatured protein.

25484224	Preparation, purification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of dual-domain β-propeller phytase from Bacillus sp. HJB17.	β-Propeller phytases (BPPs) are abundant in nature. Recently, dual-domain BPPs have been found in which the typical BPP domain is responsible for phytate hydrolysis. The dual-domain BPP (PhyH) from Bacillus sp. HJB17 was obtained with an incomplete N-terminal BPP domain (PhyH-DI; residues 41-318) and a typical BPP domain (PhyH-DII; residues 319-644) at the C-terminus. PhyH-DI was found to act synergistically (with a 1.2-2.5-fold increase in phosphate release) with PhyH-DII, other BPPs (PhyP and 168PhyA) and a histidine acid phosphatase. The structure of PhyH was therefore studied with the aim of explaining these functions. PhyH with the secreted signal peptide of the first 40 amino acids deleted (PhyHT) was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Purified and active PhyHT protein was obtained by refolding from the precipitant. PhyHT was crystallized using the vapour-diffusion method. The crystal grew in a condition consisting of 0.2 M sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 25%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000 using 1 mg ml(-1) protein solution at 289 K. A complete data set was collected from a crystal to 2.85 Å resolution using synchrotron radiation at 100 K. The crystal belonged to space group P1211, with unit-cell parameters a = 46.82, b = 140.19, c = 81.94 Å, α = 90.00, β = 92.00, γ = 90.00°. The asymmetric unit was estimated to contain one molecule of PhyHT.	2014 Dec	Lu Fang,Guo Gangxin,Li Qianqian,Feng Duo,Liu Yong,Huang Huoqing,Yang Peilong,Gao Wei,Yao Bin	Acta crystallographica.

25493352	Classification of chemical chaperones based on their effect on protein folding landscapes.	Various small molecules present in biological systems can assist protein folding in vitro and are known as chemical chaperones. De novo design of chemical chaperones with higher activity than currently known examples is desirable to ameliorate protein misfolding and aggregation in multiple contexts. However, this development has been hindered by limited knowledge of their activities. It is thought that chemical chaperones are typically poor solvents for a protein backbone and hence facilitate native structure formation. However, it is unknown if different chemical chaperones can act differently to modulate folding energy landscapes. Using a model slow folding protein, double-mutant Maltose-binding protein (DM-MBP), we show that a canonical chemical chaperone, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), accelerates refolding by decreasing the flexibility of the refolding intermediate (RI). Among a number of small molecules that chaperone DM-MBP folding, proline and serine stabilize the transition state (TS) enthalpically, while trehalose behaves like TMAO and increases the rate of barrier crossing through nonenthalpic processes. We propose a two-group classification of chemical chaperones based upon their thermodynamic effect on RI and TS, which is also supported by single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies. Interestingly, for a different test protein, the molecular mechanisms of the two groups of chaperones are not conserved. This provides a glimpse into the complexity of chemical chaperoning activity of osmolytes. Future work would allow us to engineer synergism between the two classes to design more efficient chemical chaperones to ameliorate protein misfolding and aggregation problems.	2015 Mar	Dandage Rohan,Bandyopadhyay Anannya,Jayaraj Gopal Gunanathan,Saxena Kanika,Dalal Vijit,Das Aritri,Chakraborty Kausik	ACS chemical biology. 10(3) 813-20	DM-MBP	KIEEGKLVIWINGDKGYCGLAEVGKKFEKDTGIKVTVEHPDKLEEKFPQVAATGDGPDIIFWAHDRFGGYAQSGLLAEITPDKAFQDKLYPFTWDAVRYNGKLIAYPIAVEALSLIYNKDLLPNPPKTWEEIPALDKELKAKGKSALMFNLQEPYFTWPLIAADGGYAFKYENGKYDIKDVGVDNAGAKAGLTFLVDLIKNKHMNADTDYSIAEAAFNKGETAMTINGPWAWSNIDTSKVNYGVTVLPTFKGQPSKPFVGVLSAGINAASPNKELAKEFLENYLLTDEGLEAVNKCKPLGAVALKSYEEELAKDPRIAATMENAQKGEIMPNIPQMSAFWYAVRTAVINAASGRQTVDEALKDAQTRITK		A0A0B5JXW7	Maltose binding protein	Maltose transporter subunit	7.4	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f
25497420	Characterization of recombinant pectate lyase refolded from inclusion bodies generated in E. coli BL21(DE3).	Pectate lyase (EC 4.2.2.2) gene from Bacillus subtilis RCK was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli to maximize its production. In addition to soluble fraction, bioactive pectate lyase was also obtained from inclusion body aggregates by urea solubilization and refolding under in vitro conditions. Enzyme with specific activity ∼3194IU/mg and ∼1493IU/mg were obtained from soluble and inclusion bodies (IBs) fraction with recovery of 56% and 74 0n terms of activity, respectively. The recombinant enzyme was moderately thermostable (t1/2 60min at 50°C) and optimally active in wider alkaline pH range (7.0-10.5). Interaction of protein with its cofactor CaCl2 was found to stimulate the change in tertiary structure as revealed by near UV CD spectra. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra indicated that tryptophan is involved in substrate binding and there might be independent binding of Ca(2+) and polygalacturonic acid to the active site. The recombinant enzyme was found to be capable of degrading pectin and polygalacturonic acid. The work reports novel conditions for refolding to obtain active recombinant pectate lyase from inclusion bodies and elucidates the effect of ligand and substrate binding on protein conformation by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectrofluorometry.	2015 Apr	Kumar Sandeep,Jain Kavish Kumar,Singh Anupam,Panda Amulya K,Kuhad Ramesh Chander	Protein expression and purification. 110 43-51	pectate lyase	MKKVMLATALFLGLTPAGANAADLGHQTLGSNDGWGAYSTGTTGGSKASSSNVYTVSNRNQLVSALGKETNTTPKIIYIKGTIDMNVDDNLKPLGLNDYKDPEYDLDKYLKAYDPSTWGKKEPSGTQEEARARSQKNQKARVMVDIPANTTIVGSGTNAKVVGGNFQIKSDNVIIRNIEFQDAYDYFPQWDPTDGSSGNWNSQYDNITINGGTHIWIDHCTFNDGSRPDSTSPKYYGRKYQHHDGQTDASNGANYITMSYNYYHDHDKSSIFGSSDSKTSDDGKLKITLHHNRYKNIVQRAPRVRFGQVHVYNNYYEGSTSSSSYPFSYAWGIGKSSKIYAQNNVIDVPGLSAAKTISVFSGGTALYDSGTLLNGTQINASAANGLSSSVGWTPSLHGSIDASANVKSNVINQAGAGKLN		P39116	pectin degradation	full length	8.5		t	t	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
25530617	Refolded scFv antibody fragment against myoglobin shows rapid reaction kinetics.	Myoglobin is one of the early biomarkers for acute myocardial infarction. Recently, we have screened an antibody with unique rapid reaction kinetics toward human myoglobin antigen. Antibodies with rapid reaction kinetics are thought to be an early IgG form produced during early stage of in vivo immunization. We produced a recombinant scFv fragment for the premature antibody from Escherichia coli using refolding technology. The scFv gene was constructed by connection of the V(H)-V(L) sequence with a (Gly4Ser)3 linker. The scFv fragment without the pelB leader sequence was expressed at a high level, but the solubility was extremely low. A high concentration of 8 M urea was used for denaturation. The dilution refolding process in the presence of arginine and the redox reagents GSH and GSSH successfully produced a soluble scFv protein. The resultant refolded scFv protein showed association and dissociation values of 9.32 × 10⁻⁴ M⁻¹·s⁻¹ and 6.29 × 10⁻³ s⁻¹, respectively, with an affinity value exceeding 10⁷ M⁻¹ (k(on)/k(off)), maintaining the original rapid reaction kinetics of the premature antibody. The refolded scFv could provide a platform for protein engineering for the clinical application for diagnosis of heart disease and the development of a continuous biosensor.	2014 Dec	Song Hyung-Nam,Jang Jun-Hyuck,Kim Young-Wan,Kim Dong-Hyung,Park Sung-Goo,Lee Myung Kyu,Paek Se-Hwan,Woo Eui-Jeon	International journal of molecular sciences. 15(12) 23658-71	heavy chain variable region	QIQLVQSGPELKKPGETVKISCKASGYTFTDYSIHWVRQAPEKGLKWMGWINTETGEPTYADDFTGRFAFSLETSASTAYLQITNLKNEDTATYFCARRFTTTTWFAYWGQGTLVTVSA	VH–VL sequence with a (Gly4Ser)3 linker, N-terminal His6 tag		Antibody	variable region	8.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f

25531187	Microfluidic chips with multi-junctions: an advanced tool in recovering proteins from inclusion bodies.	Active recombinant proteins are used for studying the biological functions of genes and for the development of therapeutic drugs. Overexpression of recombinant proteins in bacteria often results in the formation of inclusion bodies, which are protein aggregates with non-native conformations. Protein refolding is an important process for obtaining active recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies. However, the conventional refolding method of dialysis or dilution is time-consuming and recovered active protein yields are often low, and a cumbersome trial-and-error process is required to achieve success. To circumvent these difficulties, we used controllable diffusion through laminar flow in microchannels to regulate the denaturant concentration. This method largely aims at reducing protein aggregation during the refolding procedure.

25551710	Human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) produced in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger.	For the first time, a fungal production system is described for expression and secretion of the medically important human protein G-CSF, in Aspergillus niger. A reliable strategy was chosen with in-frame fusion of G-CSF behind a KEX2 cleavage site downstream of the coding region of the highly secreted homologous glucoamylase. This provided secretion levels of 5-10 mg/l culture medium of correctly processed G-CSF, although the majority of the protein (&gt;90%) was biologically inactive. Following denaturation/ concentration and chromatographic separation/ renaturation, the G-CSF proliferation activity increased considerably, and analytical immobilised metal affinity chromatography confirmed the monomeric and correctly folded protein. These data suggest that this human secretory protein secreted into the medium of A. niger was not correctly folded, and that it escaped the endoplasmic reticulum folding control systems. This is compared to the folding of G-CSF produced in bacteria and yeast.	2015 Jan	Kraševec Nada,Milunović Tatjana,Lasnik Marija Anžur,Lukančič Irena,Komel Radovan,Porekar Vladka Gaberc	Acta chimica Slovenica. 61(4) 709-17	granulocyte colony stimulating factor	TPLGPASSLPQSFLLKCLEQVRKIQGDGAALQEKLCATYKLCHPEELVLLGHSLGIPWAPLSSCPSQALQLAGCLSQLHSGLFLYQGLLQALEGISPELGPTLDTLQLDVADFATTIWQQMEELGMAPALQPTQGAMPAFASAFQRRAGGVLVASHLQSFLEVSYRVLRHLAQP	without signal peptide, missing 66-68	P09919	cytokine activity		7.0	room temperature	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
25558396	Human SLURP-1 and SLURP-2 Proteins Acting on Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors Reduce Proliferation of Human Colorectal Adenocarcinoma HT-29 Cells.	Human secreted Ly-6/uPAR related proteins (SLURP-1 and SLURP-2) are produced by various cells, including the epithelium and immune system. These proteins act as autocrine/paracrine hormones regulating the growth and differentiation of keratinocytes and are also involved in the control of inflammation and malignant cell transformation. These effects are assumed to be mediated by the interactions of SLURP-1 and SLURP-2 with the α7 and α3β2 subtypes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), respectively. Available knowledge about the molecular mechanism underling the SLURP-1 and SLURP-2 effects is very limited. SLURP-2 remains one of the most poorly studied proteins of the Ly-6/uPAR family. In this study, we designed for the first time a bacterial system for SLURP-2 expression and a protocol for refolding of the protein from cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Milligram quantities of recombinant SLURP-2 and its 13C-15N-labeled analog were obtained. The recombinant protein was characterized by NMR spectroscopy, and a structural model was developed. A comparative study of the SLURP-1 and SLURP-2 effects on the epithelial cell growth was conducted using human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells, which express only α7-nAChRs. A pronounced antiproliferative effect of both proteins was observed. Incubation of cells with 1 μM SLURP-1 and 1 μM SLURP-2 during 48 h led to a reduction in the cell number down to ~ 54 and 63% relative to the control, respectively. Fluorescent microscopy did not reveal either apoptotic or necrotic cell death. An analysis of the dose-response curve revealed the concentration-dependent mode of the SLURP-1 and SLURP-2 action with EC50 ~ 0.1 and 0.2 nM, respectively. These findings suggest that the α7-nAChR is the main receptor responsible for the antiproliferative effect of SLURP proteins in epithelial cells.	2015 Jan	Lyukmanova E N,Shulepko M A,Bychkov M L,Shenkarev Z O,Paramonov A S,Chugunov A O,Arseniev A S,Dolgikh D A,Kirpichnikov M P	Acta naturae. 6(4) 60-6	SLURP-2	IWCHQCTGFGGCSHGSRCLRDSTHCVTTATRVLSNTEDLPLVTKMCHIGCPDIPSLGLGPYVSIACCQTSLCNHD		Q9BZG9		UPAR/Ly6 domain	9.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	t	f	f
25562180	Expression and refolding of bioactive α-bungarotoxin V31 in E. coli.	In order to obtain bioactive α-bungarotoxin (αBtx) using recombinant protein technique, a codon-optimized synthetic gene was expressed in fusion with the N-terminal 10-His-tag and C-terminal Strep-tag in Escherichia coli. Further optimization through site-directed mutagenesis enabled moderate expression of the protein without the N-terminal His-tag or the C-terminal Strep-tag. Two such recombinant αBtx (rαBtx) were obtained, both with an additional methionine and a glycine at the N-terminal and one with (G4S1)2-Strep-tag at the C-terminal. The rαBtx proteins were refolded using a novel protocol, which efficiently produced final products with activity similar to its natural counterpart. The protocol could easily be scale up, which produced 0.3-1mg of pure and highly active rαBtx per liter of E. coli culture.	2015 Apr	Xu Jiang,Li Jia,Wu Xingan,Song Chen,Lin Ye,Shen Youxiao,Ye Wei,Sun Chenjing,Wang Xianni,Li ZhiChao,Liu Yi,Wei Longxiao,Li Zhuyi,Xu Zhikai	Protein expression and purification. 110 30-6	α-bungarotoxin	IVCHTTATSPISAVTCPPGENLCYRKMWCDVFCSSRGKVVELGCAATCPSKKPYEEVTCCSTDKCNPHPKQRPG	13-95	P60616	binding to nAChR		8.6	20	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

Bacterial porins are major outer membrane proteins that function as essential solute transporters between the bacteria and the extracellular environment. Structural features of porins are also recognized by eukaryotic cell receptors involved in innate and adaptive immunity. To better investigate the function of porins, proper refolding is necessary following purification from inclusion bodies [1, 2]. Using a single-step size exclusion chromatographic method, we have purified three major porins from pathogenic bacteria, the OmpP2 (P2) from Haemophilus influenzae, FomA from Fusobacterium nucleatum and PorB from Neisseria meningitidis, at high yield and report their unique solute transport activity with size exclusion limit.

Furthermore, we have optimized their purification method and achieved improvement of their thermostability for facilitating functional and structural analyses.	2015 Mar	Kattner Christof,Pfennig Sabrina,Massari Paola,Tanabe Mikio	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 175(6) 2907-15	FomA	KEVMPAPTPAPKKVVEYVEKPVIVYRDREVAPAWRPNGSVDVQYRWYGNVENRTPKKEDPASPWLGDNVNAGRLQTLTKVNFTEKQTLEIRTRNYHTLMNPKDSQAADDQVRVRHFYKFGKLGSSKIDVTSRLEYKKNNGDAGRKQAEASVLFDFADYIYSNNFFKADKFGFRLGYQHKWAGHNSGVVGQPFNKGTQDNYFINFESEYTLPWGFSAELNAYNYYNVHNKKFATYNKGNKKSQFYGEIEAYLYQHTPLYKTNNVELSFDFEGGYDPYTWHQYKVVSAKDSNKYEVYMLPTLQVSYKPTDFVKLYAAAGAEYRNWAVTAESKAKNWRWQPTAWAGMKVTF	without signal peptide	Q47903	porin		7.5	4	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f

Bacterial porins are major outer membrane proteins that function as essential solute transporters between the bacteria and the extracellular environment. Structural features of porins are also recognized by eukaryotic cell receptors involved in innate and adaptive immunity. To better investigate the function of porins, proper refolding is necessary following purification from inclusion bodies [1, 2].

25576039	Simplified in vitro refolding and purification of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor using protein folding cation exchange chromatography.	Protein folding-strong cation exchange chromatography (PF-SCX) has been employed for efficient refolding with simultaneous purification of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). To acquire a soluble form of renatured and purified rhG-CSF, various chromatographic conditions, including the mobile phase composition and pH was evaluated. Additionally, the effects of additives such as urea, amino acids, polyols, sugars, oxidizing agents and their amalgamations were also investigated. Under the optimal conditions, rhG-CSF was efficaciously solubilized, refolded and simultaneously purified by SCX in a single step. The experimental results using ribose (2.0M) and arginine (0.6M) combination were found to be satisfactory with mass yield, purity and specific activity of 71%, ≥99% and 2.6×10(8)IU/mg respectively. Through this investigation, we concluded that the SCX refolding method was more efficient than conventional methods which has immense potential for the large-scale production of purified rhG-CSF.	2015 Jan	Vemula Sandeep,Dedaniya Akshay,Thunuguntla Rahul,Mallu Maheswara Reddy,Parupudi Pavani,Ronda Srinivasa Reddy	Journal of chromatography.

25582764	An efficient method for the purification of proteins from four distinct toxin-antitoxin modules.	Toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules are stress response elements that are ubiquitous in the genomes of bacteria and archaea. Production and subsequent purification of individual TA proteins is anything but straightforward as over-expression of the toxin gene is lethal to bacterial and eukaryotic cells and over-production of the antitoxin leads to its proteolytic degradation because of its inherently unstructured nature. Here we describe an effective production and purification strategy centered on an on-column denaturant-induced dissociation of the toxin-antitoxin complex. The success of the method is demonstrated by its application on four different TA families, encoding proteins with distinct activities and folds. A series of biophysical and in vitro activity tests show that the purified proteins are of high quality and suitable for structural studies.	2015 Mar	Sterckx Yann G-J,De Gieter Steven,Zorzini Valentina,Hadži San,Haesaerts Sarah,Loris Remy,Garcia-Pino Abel	Protein expression and purification. 108 30-40	Doc	MRHISPEELIALHDANISRYGGLPGMSDPGRAEAIIGRVQARVAYEEITDLFEVSATYLVATARGHIFNDANKRTALNSALLFLRRNGVQVFDSPELADLTVGAATGEISVSSVADTLRRLYGSAE		Q06259	Toxic component of a toxin-antitoxin (TA) module.

25615962	Zinc-substituted pseudoazurin solved by S/Zn-SAD phasing.	The copper(II) centre of the blue copper protein pseudoazurin from Alcaligenes faecalis has been substituted by zinc(II) via denaturing the protein, chelation and removal of copper and refolding the apoprotein, followed by the addition of an aqueous solution of ZnCl2. Vapour-diffusion experiments produced colourless hexagonal crystals (space group P65), which when cryocooled had unit-cell parameters a=b=49.01, c=98.08 Å. Diffraction data collected at 100 K using a copper sealed tube were phased by the weak anomalous signal of five S atoms and one Zn atom. The structure was fitted manually and refined to 1.6 Å resolution. The zinc-substituted protein exhibits similar overall geometry to the native structure with copper. Zn2+ binds more strongly to its four ligand atoms (His40 Nδ1, Cys78 Sγ, His81 Nδ1 and Met86 Sδ) and retains the tetrahedral arrangement, although the structure is less distorted than the native copper protein.	2015 Jan	Gessmann Renate,Papadovasilaki Maria,Drougkas Evangelos,Petratos Kyriacos	Acta crystallographica.

25615981	Cloning, expression, refolding, purification and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the sensory domain of the Campylobacter chemoreceptor for aspartate A (CcaA).	In Campylobacter jejuni, chemotaxis and motility have been identified as important virulence factors that are required for host colonization and invasion. Chemotactic recognition of extracellular signals is mediated by the periplasmic sensory domains of its transducer-like proteins (Tlps). In this study, the sensory domain of the C. jejuni chemoreceptor for aspartate A (CcaA) has been expressed in Escherichia coli and purified from inclusion bodies. The urea-denatured protein was refolded and then crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using PEG 3350 as a precipitating agent. A complete data set has been collected to 1.4 Å resolution using cryocooling conditions and synchrotron radiation. The crystals belonged to space group P1, with unit-cell parameters a=39.3, b=43.3, c=50.9 Å, α=92.5, β=111.4, γ=114.7°.	2015 Jan	Machuca Mayra A,Liu Yu C,Roujeinikova Anna	Acta crystallographica.

25654333	Conformational changes during pore formation by the perforin-related protein pleurotolysin.	Membrane attack complex/perforin-like (MACPF) proteins comprise the largest superfamily of pore-forming proteins, playing crucial roles in immunity and pathogenesis. Soluble monomers assemble into large transmembrane pores via conformational transitions that remain to be structurally and mechanistically characterised. Here we present an 11 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the two-part, fungal toxin Pleurotolysin (Ply), together with crystal structures of both components (the lipid binding PlyA protein and the pore-forming MACPF component PlyB). These data reveal a 13-fold pore 80 Å in diameter and 100 Å in height, with each subunit comprised of a PlyB molecule atop a membrane bound dimer of PlyA. The resolution of the EM map, together with biophysical and computational experiments, allowed confident assignment of subdomains in a MACPF pore assembly. The major conformational changes in PlyB are a ∼70° opening of the bent and distorted central β-sheet of the MACPF domain, accompanied by extrusion and refolding of two α-helical regions into transmembrane β-hairpins (TMH1 and TMH2). We determined the structures of three different disulphide bond-trapped prepore intermediates. Analysis of these data by molecular modelling and flexible fitting allows us to generate a potential trajectory of β-sheet unbending. The results suggest that MACPF conformational change is triggered through disruption of the interface between a conserved helix-turn-helix motif and the top of TMH2. Following their release we propose that the transmembrane regions assemble into β-hairpins via top down zippering of backbone hydrogen bonds to form the membrane-inserted β-barrel. The intermediate structures of the MACPF domain during refolding into the β-barrel pore establish a structural paradigm for the transition from soluble monomer to pore, which may be conserved across the whole superfamily. The TMH2 region is critical for the release of both TMH clusters, suggesting why this region is targeted by endogenous inhibitors of MACPF function.	2015 Feb	Lukoyanova Natalya,Kondos Stephanie C,Farabella Irene,Law Ruby H P,Reboul Cyril F,Caradoc-Davies Tom T,Spicer Bradley A,Kleifeld Oded,Traore Daouda A K,Ekkel Susan M,Voskoboinik Ilia,Trapani Joseph A,Hatfaludi Tamas,Oliver Katherine,Hotze Eileen M,Tweten Rodney K,Whisstock James C,Topf Maya,Saibil Helen R,Dunstone Michelle A	PLoS biology. 13(2) e1002049	Pleurotolysin B	SQAGDTLNDVIQDPTRRNKLINDNNLLKGIIMGRDGPVPSSRELIVRPDTLRAIINNRATIETTTMEAEFTETLMESNYNSASVKVSAPFITANSEYSESSSFKNTETEKSMYTSSRYLFPQGRIDFTTPDSGFDDVIKLSPQFTSGVQAALAKATGTEKREALQNLFQEYGHVFRTKVHIGGVLSAHTMETFSRSENETEVKQDVKAGLEGAVKGWGGGATAGHGNTQGTITTSQNRKLNVKYIVNGGDYTKIQNTEEWVASTNQSEHWRVIEVTEVTAVADLLPQPIRGQVKDLLKPLLGKWVDVEKVPGLESLPVSVYRPKGAIPAGWFWLGDTADASKALLVKPTLPARSGRNPALTSLHQGSGMTEQPFVDLPQYQYLSTYFGSFAHDTPPGSTLRGLRPDHVLPGRYEMHGDTISTAVYVTRPVDVPFPEDECFDLKSLVRVKLPGSGNPPKPRSALKKSMVLFDSGEK	49-523	Q5W9E8	pore-forming protein		8.5		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	t	t

25654333	Conformational changes during pore formation by the perforin-related protein pleurotolysin.	Membrane attack complex/perforin-like (MACPF) proteins comprise the largest superfamily of pore-forming proteins, playing crucial roles in immunity and pathogenesis. Soluble monomers assemble into large transmembrane pores via conformational transitions that remain to be structurally and mechanistically characterised. Here we present an 11 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the two-part, fungal toxin Pleurotolysin (Ply), together with crystal structures of both components (the lipid binding PlyA protein and the pore-forming MACPF component PlyB). These data reveal a 13-fold pore 80 Å in diameter and 100 Å in height, with each subunit comprised of a PlyB molecule atop a membrane bound dimer of PlyA. The resolution of the EM map, together with biophysical and computational experiments, allowed confident assignment of subdomains in a MACPF pore assembly. The major conformational changes in PlyB are a ∼70° opening of the bent and distorted central β-sheet of the MACPF domain, accompanied by extrusion and refolding of two α-helical regions into transmembrane β-hairpins (TMH1 and TMH2). We determined the structures of three different disulphide bond-trapped prepore intermediates. Analysis of these data by molecular modelling and flexible fitting allows us to generate a potential trajectory of β-sheet unbending. The results suggest that MACPF conformational change is triggered through disruption of the interface between a conserved helix-turn-helix motif and the top of TMH2. Following their release we propose that the transmembrane regions assemble into β-hairpins via top down zippering of backbone hydrogen bonds to form the membrane-inserted β-barrel. The intermediate structures of the MACPF domain during refolding into the β-barrel pore establish a structural paradigm for the transition from soluble monomer to pore, which may be conserved across the whole superfamily.

25659501	Improved Production and Characterization of Recombinant Human Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor from E. coli under Optimized Downstream Processes.	This work reports the upstream and downstream process of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS. The fed batch mode was selected for the maximum output of biomass (6.4g/L) and purified rhG-CSF (136mg/L) under suitable physicochemical environment. The downstream processing steps viz., recovery, solubilization, refolding and concentration were optimized in this study. The maximum rhG-CSF inclusion bodies recovery yield (97%) was accomplished with frequent homogenization and sonication procedure. An efficient solubilization (96%) of rhG-CSF inclusion bodies were observed with 8M urea at pH 9.5. Refolding efficiency studies showed maximum refolding ⩾86% and ⩾84% at 20°C and pH 9 respectively. The renatured protein solution was concentrated, clarified and partially purified (⩾95%) by the cross flow filtration technique. The concentrated protein was further purified by a single step size exclusion chromatography with ⩾981fb7850urity. The characterization of purified rhG-CSF molecular mass as evidenced by SDS-PAGE, western blot and LC/MS analysis was shown to be 18.8kDa. The secondary structure of rhG-CSF was evaluated by the CD spectroscopic technique based on the helical structural components. The biological activity of the purified rhG-CSF showed a similar activity of cell proliferation with the standard rhG-CSF. Overall, the results demonstrate an optimized downstream process for obtaining high yields of biologically active rhG-CSF.	2015 Mar	Vemula Sandeep,Thunuguntla Rahul,Dedaniya Akshay,Kokkiligadda Sujana,Palle Chaitanya,Ronda Srinivasa Reddy	Protein expression and purification. 108 62-72	rhG-CSF	TPLGPASSLPQSFLLKCLEQVRKIQGDGAALQEKLCATYKLCHPEELVLLGHSLGIPWAPLSSCPSQALQLAGCLSQLHSGLFLYQGLLQALEGISPELGPTLDTLQLDVADFATTIWQQMEELGMAPALQPTQGAMPAFASAFQRRAGGVLVASHLQSFLEVSYRVLRHLAQP		A0A0B4U5E3	cytokine	mature peptide	9	30	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
25662072	Tat PTD-endostatin: A novel anti-angiogenesis protein with ocular barrier permeability via eye-drops.	BACKGROUND:Endostatin, a specific inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, has been proved to have effects on ocular neovascular diseases by intraocular injection. In order to increase its permeability to ocular barriers and make it effective on fundus oculi angiogenesis diseases via non-invasive administration (eye drops), endostatin was fused to Tat PTD via a genetic engineering method.METHODS:Most of the Tat PTD- endostatin was expressed as inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli, so pure and active Tat PTD-endostatin was prepared by a series of operations, including inclusion body denaturation, refolding and chromatography. The anti-angiogenesis activity of Tat PTD-endostatin was investigated by cell proliferation experiments and chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay. In addition, its translocating ability and concrete entry mechanism into cells were also investigated by fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry. The penetrating ability to ocular barriers was also studied by immunohistochemistry. A mouse choroidal neovascularization model was established to investigate the pharmacodynamics of Tat PTD-endostatin.RESULTS:The obtained Tat PTD-endostatin had excellent anti-angiogenesis activity and was superior to Es in cellular translocating. Macropinocytosis may be the dominant route of entry of Tat PTD-endostatin into cells. Tat PTD-endostatin could cross ocular barriers and arrive at the retina after eye-drop administration. In addition, it displayed inhibitory effects on choroidal neovascularization via eye drops.CONCLUSIONS:Tat PTD-endostatin possessed excellent ocular penetrating ability and anti-angiogenesis effects.GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE:Tat PTD is a promising ocular delivery tool, and Tat PTD-endostatin is a potential drug for curing fundus oculi angiogenesis diseases.	2015 Apr	Zhang Xinke,Li Yan,Cheng Yanna,Tan Haining,Li Zhiwei,Qu Yi,Mu Guoying,Wang Fengshan	Biochimica et biophysica acta. 1850(6) 1140-9	Endostatin	HTHTSGPGLHLIALNSPQVGNMRGIRGADFMCFQQARAVGMKGTFRAFLSSKLQDLYSIVRRSDRETLPIVNLKDQVLFSSWESLFSDSESRMKDNAPIYSFDGRDVLRDSAWPEKMIWHGSDGRGHRQTDNYCETWRAGDRAVTGLASSLQAGQLLQQTSSSCSSSYIVLCIENSYMTQSKK		Q4TZW5	inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis	full length	8.2	4	t	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f

25687285	One-pot refolding of core histones from bacterial inclusion bodies allows rapid reconstitution of histone octamer.	We report an optimized method to purify and reconstitute histone octamer, which utilizes high expression of histones in inclusion bodies but eliminates the time consuming steps of individual histone purification. In the newly modified protocol, Xenopus laevis H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are expressed individually into inclusion bodies of bacteria, which are subsequently mixed together and denatured in 8M guanidine hydrochloride. Histones are refolded and reconstituted into soluble octamer by dialysis against 2M NaCl, and metal-affinity purified through an N-terminal polyhistidine-tag added on the H2A. After cleavage of the polyhistidine-tag, histone octamer is further purified by size exclusion chromatography. We show that the nucleosomes reconstituted using the purified histone octamer above are fully functional. They serve as effective substrates for the histone methyltransferases DOT1L and MLL1. Small angle X-ray scattering further confirms that the reconstituted nucleosomes have correct structural integration of histone octamer and DNA as observed in the X-ray crystal structure. Our new protocol enables rapid reconstitution of histone octamer with an optimal yield. We expect this simplified approach to facilitate research using recombinant nucleosomes in vitro.	2015 Apr	Lee Young-Tae,Gibbons Garrett,Lee Shirley Y,Nikolovska-Coleska Zaneta,Dou Yali	Protein expression and purification. 110 89-94	histone octamer	MPDPAKSAPAAKKGSKKAVTKTQKKDGKKRRKSRKESYAIYVYKVLKQVHPDTGISSKAMSIMNSFVNDVFERIAGEASRLAHYNKRSTITSREIQTAVRLLLPGELAKHAVSEGTKAVTKYTSAK		Q92130	DNA binding protein	full length	5.2	room temperature	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t

25688756	Recombinant expression and characterization of biologically active protein delta homolog 1.	Obesity is characterized by an excessive accumulation of body fat, for which impaired adipogenesis is believed to play a crucial role. As a gatekeeper of early adipogenesis, protein delta homolog 1 (DLK1) has a pivotal role in deciding whether pre-adipocytes will differentiate, determining the balance between healthy and unhealthy fat tissue. Here, an expression system for the cysteine-rich soluble human DLK1 was established. DLK1 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysRARE, purified by affinity chromatography and refolded by stepwise dialysis. Identity, purity, secondary structure and refolding efficiency were determined. Proteolytic digestion followed by mass spectrometry analysis proved correct disulfide bridge formation. The biological activity of DLK1 was examined by differentiation assays in murine pre-adipocyte-like 3T3-L1 cells. Thereby, recombinantly produced DLK1 was shown to inhibit adipogenesis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. All in all, our approach gives access to large amounts of active DLK1 and can be transferred to related proteins.	2015 Apr	Kilian Tom-Marten,Beck-Sickinger Annette G	Protein expression and purification. 110 72-8	protein delta homolog 1	AECFPACNPQNGFCEDDNVCRCQPGWQGPLCDQCVTSPGCLHGLCGEPGQCICTDGWDGELCDRDVRACSSAPCANNRTCVSLDDGLYECSCAPGYSGKDCQKKDGPCVINGSPCQHGGTCVDDEGRASHASCLCPPGFSGNFCEIVANSCTPNPCENDGVCTDIGGDFRCRCPAGFIDKTCSRPVTNCASSPCQNGGTCLQHTQVSYECLCKPEFTGLTCVKKRALSPQQVTRLPSGYGLAYRLTPGVHELPVQQPEHRILKVSMKELNKKTPLLTEGQ		P80370	para- and autocrine signal	topological domain	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
25703052	Comparison of the purification of biologically active IL-7 cytokine expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris.	The large scale screening of cytokine mutants is a component of binding and activity mapping and requires an efficient method of cytokine protein expression. Here, we compared recombinant IL-7 expression with and purification from Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. The IL-7 cytokine contains three disulfide bonds that are essential for its biological activity, and which are formed upon secretion through P. pastoris, but not in the reducing cytoplasm of E. coli. In contrast to a previous report we found that P. pastoris secretes active but N-linked hyperglycosylated IL-7. Enzymatic deglycosylation was incompatible with activity measurements in a cell based assay. E. coli expressed IL-7 was refolded from solubilized inclusion bodies. A chromatographic purification step between inclusion body solubilization and refolding increased the yield of biologically active monomeric IL-7, and decreased the amount of inactive soluble aggregates. Cation exchange chromatography of untagged IL-7, and IMAC of His-tagged IL-7 improved refolding yields to a similar extend, indicating that the removal of contaminating components in the solubilized inclusion bodies improves refolding efficiency. We conclude that a chromatographic purification step of IL-7 solubilized from E. coli inclusion bodies increases refolding yield, and may be a suitable general rescue strategy for obtaining folded and biologically active proteins from inclusion bodies.	2015 Apr	Zaremba-Czogalla Magdalena,Stumpp Christian,Bonifacio Ezio,Paul Ralf	Protein expression and purification. 110 65-71	The IL-7 cytokine	DCDIEGKDGKQYESVLMVSIDQLLDSMKEIGSNCLNNEFNFFKRHICDANKEGMFLFRAARKLRQFLKMNSTGDFDLHLLKVSEGTTILLNCTGQVKGRKPAALGEAQPTKSLEENKSLKEQKKLNDLCFLKRLLQEIKTCWNKILMGTKEH	without signal peptide	P13232	Hematopoietic growth factor	Full length	8	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
25703053	Secretagogin, a hexa EF-hand calcium-binding protein: high level bacterial overexpression, one-step purification and properties.	Secretagogin (SCGN), a hexa EF-hand calcium-binding protein, is highly expressed in the endocrine cells (especially in pancreatic islets) and in restricted neuronal sub-populations, albeit at comparatively low level. Since SCGN is predicted to be a potential neuroendocrine marker in carcinoid tumors of lung and gastrointestinal tract, it is of paramount importance to understand the features of this protein in different environment for assigning its crucial functions in different tissues and under pathophysiological conditions. To score out the limitation of protein for in vitro studies, we report a one-step, high purity and high level bacterial purification of secretagogin by refolding from the inclusion bodies yielding about 40mg protein per litre of bacterial culture. We also report previously undocumented Ca(2+)/Mg(2+) binding and hydrodynamic properties of secretagogin.	2015 Mar	Sharma Anand Kumar,Khandelwal Radhika,Sharma Yogendra,Rajanikanth Vangipurapu	Protein expression and purification. 109 113-9	secretagogin	MDNARRKTPARLDAACFWQIWQRFDKEEKGYIRETELDAFFDHLLAKSGTEDTLMEENVQKVKEQLMTSHNVSKEGRILMKELASMFLSEDENFLLFFRLETPLDNSVEFMQIWRKYDADSSGFISAAELCNFLRDLFLHHKKNISEAELEEYTSTMMKIFDKNKDGRLDLNDLARILALQENFLLQFKMDASSTEERKRDFEKIFAHYDVSKTGALEGPEVDGFVKDMMELVQPSISGVDLDKFREILLRHCDVNKDGKIQKSELALCLGLKINP		Q91WD9	calcium ion binding	EF-hands 1-6	7.5	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	t	t	t	f	f	f
25703054	Recombinant production of biologically active giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) growth hormone from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli by fed-batch culture.	Growth hormone (GH) performs important roles in regulating somatic growth, reproduction, osmoregulation, metabolism and immunity in teleosts, and thus, it has attracted substantial attention in the field of aquaculture application. Herein, giant grouper GH (ggGH) cDNA was cloned into the pET28a vector and expressed in Shuffle® T7 Competent Escherichia coli. Recombinant N-terminal 6× His-tagged ggGH was produced mainly in insoluble inclusion bodies; the recombinant ggGH content reached 200f total protein. For large-scale ggGH production, high-cell density E. coli culture was achieved via fed-batch culture with pH-stat. After 30h of cultivation, a cell concentration of 41.1g/l dry cell weight with over 951fb7850lasmid stability was reached. Maximal ggGH production (4.0g/l; 220tal protein) was achieved via mid-log phase induction. Various centrifugal forces, buffer pHs and urea concentrations were optimized for isolation and solubilization of ggGH from inclusion bodies. Hydrophobic interactions and ionic interactions were the major forces in ggGH inclusion body formation. Complete ggGH inclusion body solubilization was obtained in PBS buffer at pH 12 containing 3M urea. Through a simple purification process including Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and refolding, 5.7mg of ggGH was obtained from 10ml of fed-batch culture (45% recovery). The sequence and secondary structure of the purified ggGH were confirmed by LC-MS/MS mass spectrometry and circular dichroism analysis. The cell proliferation-promoting activity was confirmed in HepG2, ZFL and GF-1 cells with the WST-1 colorimetric bioassay.	2015 Apr	Chung Wen-Jen,Huang Chi-Lung,Gong Hong-Yi,Ou Tsung-Yin,Hsu Jue-Liang,Hu Shao-Yang	Protein expression and purification. 110 79-88	giant grouper growth hormone (ggGH)	MDRVVLLLSVVSLGVSSQPITDGQRLFSIAVSRVQHLHLLAQRLFSDFESTLQTEEQRQLNKIFLQDFCNSDYIISPIDKHETQRSSVLKLLSISYRLVESWEFPSRSLSGGSAPRNQISPKLSELKTGILLLIRANQDGAELFPDSSALQLAPYGNYYQSLGADESLRRTYELLACFKKDMHKVETYLTVAKCRLSPEANCTL		B3TLD2	Growth hormone	full length	7.3	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
25737132	Optimization Studies on Prokaryotic Cell Expression of the Human Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL).	The aim of the study was to optimize the in vitro induction and expression of the human tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and also study the processes of its denaturation, renaturation, and purification. The pGEX-6P-1/TRAIL114-281 plasmid was induced by isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and the expressed target protein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein expressed in the form of inclusion body was first denaturalized and then renaturalized by dilution and dialysis technique. GST-rTRAIL114-281 fusion protein was purified by Glutathione-Superflow Resin affinity chromatography and confirmed by Western blot. The molecular weight of GST-rTRAIL expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) was approximately 40 kDa. GST-rTRAIL was mainly expressed in the form of inclusion bodies. An optimum expression was induced by IPTG at a concentration of 0.2 mM for 8 h at 37 °C. Glutathione-Superflow Resin affinity chromatography yielded the purified GST-rTRAIL protein which was confirmed by Western blot using anti-GST mouse monoclonal antibody. The optimum prokaryotic cell expression of the human GST-rTRAIL was obtained by 0.2 mM IPTG induction for 8 h at 37 °C. The denatured inclusion body protein can be refolded by dilution and dialysis and purified by Glutathione-Superflow Resin affinity chromatography.	2016 Jun	Hao Lin,Zhang Zhi-Guo,Shi Zheng-Duo,Pang Kun,Zhang Jun-Jie,Dong Yang,Han Cong-Hui	Cell biochemistry and biophysics. 73(2) 275-9	tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand	VRERGPQRVAAHITGTRGRSNTLSSPNSKNEKALGRKINSWESSRSGHSFLSNLHLRNGELVIHEKGFYYIYSQTYFRFQEEIKENTKNDKQMVQYIYKYTSYPDPILLMKSARNSCWSKDAEYGLYSIYQGGIFELKENDRIFVSVTNEHLIDMDHEASFFGAFLVG	114-281, GST tag	P50591	cytokine		9.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
25747528	Isolation and characterization of a 17-kDa FKBP-type peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase from Vibrio anguillarum.	Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) catalyzes the isomerization of peptide bonds to achieve conformational changes in native folded proteins. An FKBP-type PPIase with an approximate molecular weight of 17kDa was isolated from Vibrio anguillarum O1 and named VaFKBP17. To investigate its biochemical properties, the ppi gene from V. anguillarum O1 was isolated and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. A protease-coupled assay for isomerization activity, using Succinyl-Ala-Phe-Pro-Phe-p nitroanilide as substrate, indicated that the activity of VaFKBP17 was highest at low temperature (5°C) and alkaline conditions (pH 10). The immunosuppressant FK506 inhibited the isomerization activity of VaFKBP17. The chaperone activity of VaFKBP17 was assessed using a citrate synthase thermal aggregation activity assay. To evaluate its ability to catalyze protein refolding, the effect of VaFKBP17 on inclusion bodies was investigated during a dilution process. In this assay, VaFKBP17 was able to assist protein refolding. These results provide evidence that VaFKBP17 possesses chaperone-like activity. The structural homology of VaFKBP17 relative to other known bacterial FKBPs was also examined.	2015 Apr	Jo Geon-A,Lee Jong Min,No Gyuyou,Kang Dong Seop,Kim So-Hyun,Ahn Sun-Hee,Kong In-Soo	Protein expression and purification. 110 130-7	β-1,3–1,4-glucanase	MSYRMKRVLLLLVTGLFLSLCAITSTASAQTGGSFFEPFNSYNSGLWKKANGYSNGDMFNCTWRANNVSMTSSGEMRLALTSPSYNKFDCGENRSVQTYGYGLYEVRMKPAKNTGIVSSFFTYTGPTDGTPWDEIDIEFLGKDTTKVQFNYYTNGAGNHEKIVDLGFDAANAYHTYAFDWQANSIKWYVDGQLKHTATNQIPTTPGKIMMNLWNGIGVDDWLGSYNGVNPLYAHYDWVRYTKK		I1W007	beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase	full length	6	5	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
25813669	Prokaryotic Expression, Refolding and Purification of High-Purity Mouse Midkine in Escherichia coli.	To evaluate the clinic safety of human Midkine as an articular protective agent, recombinant mouse Midkine (rmMK) was prepared in prokaryotic system for the pre-clinic long-term studies in mice. The open reading frame of mouse Midkine (mMK) was sub-cloned onto expression vector pET30a (+) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain line. The rmMK protein, with a Met fused at N terminus of native mMK for expression initiating, proved to be expressed in inclusion bodies and turned out to be soluble post-denaturation and renaturation. The soluble rmMK was purified successfully with ion exchange and affinity chromatography and characterised good enough to meet the requirements for animal use. Eventually, 13.2-mg rmMK with high quality and bioactivity was obtained from 1 L LB culture, and the total recovery was 11.4%. The present work laid a good foundation for pilot- or large-scale production of rmMK in prokaryotic system.	2015 May	Gao Jin,Wang Haixia	Applied biochemistry and biotechnology. 176(2) 454-66	Midkine	MKKKEKVKKGSECSEWTWGPCTPSSKDCGMGFREGTCGAQTQRVHCKVPCNWKKEFGADCKYKFESWGACDGSTGTKARQGTLKKARYNAQCQETIRVTKPCTSKTKSKTKAKKGKGKD	without signal peptide, a Met is fused at N terminus	P12025	heparin binding		7.4	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
25814670	Low pH-driven folding of WW45-SARAH domain leads to stabilization of the WW45-Mst2 complex.	The scaffolding protein Salvador (Sav) plays a key role in the Hippo (Hpo) signalling pathway, which controls tissue growth by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting apoptosis. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway contributes to cancer development. Since the identification of the first Sav gene in 2002, very little is known regarding the molecular basis of Sav-SARAH mediating interactions due to its insolubility. In this study, refolding of the first Sav (known as WW45)-SARAH provided insight into the biochemical and biophysical properties, indicating that WW45-SARAH exhibits properties of a disordered protein, when the domain was refolded at a neutral pH. Interestingly, WW45-SARAH shows folded and rigid conformations relative to the decrease in pH. Further, diffracting crystals were obtained from protein refolded under acidic pH, suggesting that the refolded WW45 protein at low pH has a homogeneous and stable conformation. A comparative analysis of molecular properties found that the acidic-stable fold of WW45-SARAH enhances a heterotypic interaction with Mst2-SARAH. In addition, using an Mst2 mutation that disrupts homotypic dimerization, we showed that the monomeric Mst2-SARAH domain could form a stable complex of 1:1 stoichiometric ratio with WW45 refolded under acidic pH.	2015 Aug	Song Jinsue,Hong Hye Rim,Yamashita Eiki,Park Il Yeong,Lee Soo Jae	Journal of biochemistry. 158(3) 181-8	Salvador (Sav)	APVKYDHILKWELFQLADLDTYQGMLKLLFMKELEQIVKMYEAYRQALLTELENRKQRQQWYAQQHGKNF		Q9H4B6	scaffold proteincontrol the Hippo signalling pathway	SARAH domain (residues 314–383)	3.5		f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f
25817170	Osmolyte mixtures have different effects than individual osmolytes on protein folding and functional activity.	Osmolytes are small organic molecules accumulated by organisms under stress conditions to protect macromolecular structure and function. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of several binary osmolyte mixtures on the protein folding/stability and function of RNase-A. For this, we have measured ΔGD(o) (Gibbs free energy change at 25°C) and specific activity of RNase-A mediated hydrolysis of cytidine 2&#39;-3&#39; cyclic monophosphate in the presence and absence of individual and osmolyte mixtures. It was found that the osmolyte mixtures have different effect on protein stability and function than that of individual osmolytes. Refolding studies of RNase-A in the presence of osmolyte mixtures and individual osmolytes also revealed that osmolyte mixtures have a poor refolding efficiency relative to the individual osmolytes.	2015 Apr	Warepam Marina,Singh Laishram Rajendrakumar	Archives of biochemistry and biophysics. 573 77-83	RNase-A(type III-A)	KETAAAKFERQHMDSSTSAASSSNYCNQMMKSRNLTKDRCKPVNTFVHESLADVQAVCSQKNVACKNGQTNCYQSYSTMSITDCRETGSSKYPNCAYKTTQANKHIIVACEGNPYVPVHFDASV	without signal peptide	P61823	RNA cleavage	full length	7.0	25	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
25879903	A single freeze-thawing cycle for highly efficient solubilization of inclusion body proteins and its refolding into bioactive form.	BACKGROUND:Mild solubilization of inclusion bodies has attracted attention in recent days, with an objective to preserve the existing native-like secondary structure of proteins, reduce protein aggregation during refolding and recovering high amount of bioactive proteins from inclusion bodies.RESULTS:Here we presented an efficient method for mild solubilization of inclusion bodies by using a freeze-thawing process in the presence of low concentration of urea. We used two different proteins to demonstrate the advantage of this method over the traditional urea-denatured method: enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and the catalytic domain of human macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12_CAT). Firstly, PBS buffer at pH 8 containing different molar concentration of urea (0-8 M) were used to solubilize EGFP and MMP-12-CAT inclusion bodies and the solubility achieved in 2 M urea in PBS buffer by freeze-thawing method was comparable to that of PBS buffer containing 8 M urea by traditional urea-denatured method. Secondly, different solvents were used to solubilize EGFP and MMP-12_CAT from inclusion bodies and the results indicated that a wide range of buffers containing 2 M urea could efficiently solubilize EGFP and MMP-12_CAT inclusion bodies by freeze-thawing method. Thirdly, the effect of pH and freezing temperature on the solubility of EGFP and MMP-12_CAT inclusion bodies were studied, revealing that solubilization of inclusion bodies by freeze-thawing method is pH dependent and the optimal freezing temperature indicated here is -20°C. Forth, the solubilized EGFP and MMP-12_CAT from inclusion bodies were refolded by rapid dilution and dialysis, respectively. The results showed that the refolded efficiency is much higher (more than twice) from freeze-thawing method than the traditional urea-denatured method. The freeze-thawing method containing 2 M urea also effectively solubilized a number of proteins as inclusion bodies in E.coli.CONCLUSIONS:Mild solubilization of inclusion body proteins using the freeze-thawing method is simple, highly efficient and generally applicable. The method can be utilized to prepare large quantities of bioactive soluble proteins from inclusion bodies for basic research and industrial purpose.	2015 Apr	Qi Xingmei,Sun Yifan,Xiong Sidong	Microbial cell factories. 14 24	enhanced green fluorescent protein	MSKGEELFTGVVPILVELDGDVNGHKFSVSGEGEGDATYGKLTLKFICTTGKLPVPWPTLVTTLTYGVQCFSRYPDHMKQHDFFKSAMPEGYVQERTIFFKDDGNYKTRAEVKFEGDTLVNRIELKGIDFKEDGNILGHKLEYNYNSHNVYIMADKQKNGIKVNFKIRHNIEDGSVQLADHYQQNTPIGDGPVLLPDNHYLSTQSALSKDPNEKRDHMVLLEFVTAAGITLGMDELYK	F64L, S65T, H231L mutant	P42212	photoprotein		8	room temperature	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f

25907380	Expression, purification and characterization of cold shock protein A of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.	The gram-positive bacterium Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is the causative agent of different diseases that cause dramatically reduced yields of wool and milk, and results in weight loss, carcass condemnation and also death mainly in sheep, equids, cattle and goats and therefore globally results in considerable economical loss. Cold shock proteins are conserved in many bacteria and eukaryotic cells and they help to restore normal cell functions after cold shock in which some appear to have specific functions at normal growth temperature as well. Cold shock protein A from C. pseudotuberculosis was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The thermal unfolding/refolding process characterized by circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy techniques indicated that the refolding process was almost completely reversible.	2015 May	Lindae Antje,Eberle Raphael J,Caruso Icaro P,Coronado Monika A,de Moraes Fabio R,Azevedo Vasco,Arni Raghuvir K	Protein expression and purification. 112 15-20	cold shock protein A	MAQGTVKWFNAEKGFGFIAPDDGSADVFVHYSEIQGNGFRTLEENQKVEFEIGEGAKGPQAQQVHAL		D9Q632	cold shock protein		7.5	25	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f
25913370	Efficient production of a correctly folded mouse α-defensin, cryptdin-4, by refolding during inclusion body solubilization.	Mammalian α-defensins contribute to innate immunity by exerting antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. To perform structural and functional analysis of α-defensins, large amounts of α-defensins are essential. Although many expression systems for the production of recombinant α-defensins have been developed, attempts to obtain large amounts of α-defensins have been only moderately successful. Therefore, in this study, we applied a previously developed aggregation-prone protein coexpression method for the production of mouse α-defensin cryptdin-4 (Crp4) in order to enhance the formation of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli expression system. By using this method, we succeeded in obtaining a large amount of Crp4 in the form of inclusion bodies. Moreover, we attempted to refold Crp4 directly during the inclusion-body solubilization step under oxidative conditions. Surprisingly, even without any purification, Crp4 was efficiently refolded during the solubilization step of inclusion bodies, and the yield was better than that of the conventional refolding method. NMR spectra of purified Crp4 suggested that it was folded into its correct tertiary structure. Therefore, the method described in this study not only enhances the expression of α-defensin as inclusion bodies, but also eliminates the cumbersome and time-consuming refolding step.	2015 May	Tomisawa Satoshi,Sato Yuji,Kamiya Masakatsu,Kumaki Yasuhiro,Kikukawa Takashi,Kawano Keiichi,Demura Makoto,Nakamura Kiminori,Ayabe Tokiyoshi,Aizawa Tomoyasu	Protein expression and purification. 112 21-8	mouse α-defensin cryptdin-4 (Crp4)	GLLCYCRKGHCKRGERVRGTCGIRFLYCCPRR		P28311	Probably contributes to the antimicrobial barrier function of the small bowel mucosa.

25950964	Purification, Refolding, and Crystallization of the Outer Membrane Protein OmpG from Escherichia coli.	OmpG is a pore-forming protein from E. coli outer membranes. Unlike the classical outer membrane porins, which are trimers, the OmpG channel is a monomeric β-barrel made of 14 antiparallel β-strands with short periplasmic turns and longer extracellular loops. The channel activity of OmpG is pH dependent and the channel is gated by the extracellular loop L6. At neutral/high pH, the channel is open and permeable for substrate molecules with a size up to 900 Da. At acidic pH, loop L6 folds across the channel and blocks the pore. The channel blockage at acidic pH appears to be triggered by the protonation of a histidine pair on neighboring β-strands, which repel one another, resulting in the rearrangement of loop L6 and channel closure. OmpG was purified by refolding from inclusion bodies and crystallized in two and three dimensions. Crystallization and analysis by electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography revealed the fundamental mechanisms essential for the channel activity.	2015 May	Köster Stefan,van Pee Katharina,Yildiz Özkan	Methods in enzymology. 557 149-66	outer membrane protein G	EERNDWHFNIGAMYEIENVEGYGEDMDGLAEPSVYFNAANGPWRIALAYYQEGPVDYSAGKRGTWFDRPELEVHYQFLENDDFSFGLTGGFRNYGYHYVDEPGKDTANMQRWKIAPDWDVKLTDDLRFNGWLSMYKFANDLNTTGYADTRVETETGLQYTFNETVALRVNYYLERGFNMDDSRNNGEFSTQEIRAYLPLTLGNHSVTPYTRIGLDRWSNWDWQDDIEREGHDFNRVGLFYGYDFQNGLSVSLEYAFEWQDHDEGDSDKFHYAGVGVNYSF	without signal peptide, C-terminal His6 tag	P76045	porin		8.0	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	t	f
25959459	Efficient production of Tymovirus like particles displaying immunodominant epitopes of Japanese Encephalitis Virus envelope protein.	Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito borne arboviral infection caused by Japanese Encephalitis Virus (JEV). It is a major cause of viral encephalitis in Asian countries including India. In the present study, we have used a Tymovirus [i.e. Physalis Mottle Virus (PhMV) coat protein (CP)], which forms virus like particles (VLPs) as a template to display immunodominant epitopes of JEV envelope (E) protein. The immunodominant epitopes of JEV were inserted at the N-terminus of the wild type PhMV CP, and these constructs were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The chimeric proteins were purified from the inclusion bodies and evaluated for VLP formation. The purified protein was identified by Western blotting and VLP formation was studied and confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. Finally, the immunogenicity was studied in mice. Our results indicate that the chimeric protein with JEV epitopes assembled efficiently to form VLPs generating neutralizing antibodies. Hence, we report the purified chimeric VLP would be a potent vaccine candidate, which needs to be evaluated in a mouse challenge model.	2015 Jun	Shahana Pallichera Vijayan,Das Dipankar,Gontu Abhinay,Chandran Dev,Maithal Kapil	Protein expression and purification. 113 35-43	chimeric protein of PhMV and JEV1	HMKIPIVSVASLNDMTPVGRLVTVNPFVATSSANSGGSGGGTAETAAQVSLQTADPITKLTAPYRHAQIVECKAILTPTDLAVSNPLTVYLAWVPANSPATPTQILRVYGGQSFVLGGAISAAKTIEVPLNLDSVNRMLKDSVTYTDTPKLLAYSRAPTNPSKIPTASIQISGRIRLSKPMLIAN					8.5	4	t	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	f	f	f
25979480	High-level expression of pseudolysin, the extracellular elastase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in Escherichia coli and its purification.	Pseudolysin is the extracellular elastase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and belongs to the thermolysin-like family of metallopeptidases. Pseudolysin has been identified as a robust drug target and a biotechnologically important enzyme in the tanning industry. Previous attempts to purify active pseudolysin from P. aeruginosa or by expression in Escherichia coli yielded low quantities. Considerable expression and purification of secreted pseudolysin from Pichia pastoris has been reported but it is time-consuming and not cost-effective. We report the successful large-scale expression of pseudolysin in E. coli and purification of the correctly folded and active protein. The lasB gene that codes for the enzymatically active mature 33-kilodalton pseudolysin was expressed with a histidine tag under the control of the T7 promoter. Pseudolysin expressed highly in E. coli and was solubilized and purified in 8M urea by metal affinity chromatography. The protein was simultaneously further purified, refolded and buffer-exchanged on a preparative Superdex 200 column by a modified urea reverse-gradient size exclusion chromatography. Using this technique, precipitation of pseudolysin was completely eliminated. Refolded pseudolysin was found to be active as assessed by its ability to hydrolyze N-succinyl-ala-ala-ala-p-nitroanilide. The purification scheme yielded approximately 40 mg of pseudolysin per liter of expression culture and specific activity of 3.2U/mg of protein using N-succinyl-ala-ala-ala-p-nitroanilide as substrate. This approach provides a reproducible strategy for high-level expression and purification of active metallopeptidases and perhaps other inclusion body-forming and precipitation-prone proteins.	2015 Jun	Odunuga Odutayo O,Adekoya Olayiwola A,Sylte Ingebrigt	Protein expression and purification. 113 79-84	pseudolysin	EAGGPGGNQKIGKYTYGSDYGPLIVNDRCEMDDGNVITVDMNGSTNDSKTTPFRFACPTNTYKQVNGAYSPLNDAHFFGGVVFNLYRDWFGTSPLTHKLYMKVHYGRSVENAYWDGTAMLFGDGATMFYPLVSLDVAAHEVSHGFTEQNSGLIYRGQSGGMNEAFSDMAGEAAEFYMRGKNDFLIGYDIKKGSGALRYMDQPSRDGRSIDNASQYYNGIDVHHSSGVYNRAFYLLANSPGWDTRKAFEVFVDANRYYWTATSNYNSGACGVISSAQNRNYSAADVTRAFSTVGVTCPSAL	The 199-498 of full length was amplified by PCR and cloned.

25981701	Identification and characterization of aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 from Lampetra japonica and its protective role against cytotoxicity.	Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs), which oxidize aldehyde to corresponding acids, play a major role in the detoxification of various endogenous and exogenous aldehydes. In this study, we cloned and characterized ALDH9 (designated LjALDH9) from Arctic lamprey Lampetra japonica. The open reading frame of LjALDH9 was 1566 bp, encoding 521 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55.68 kDa. LjALDH9 protein had a signal peptide and Aldedh domain with the active site Cys315. In addition, LjALDH9 shares high sequence homology with ALDH9 of jawed vertebrates. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed that LjALDH9 was highly expressed in the buccal gland. A reactive LjALDH9 protein was obtained by prokaryotic expression, two-step-denaturing and refolding and affinity purification. During enzyme activity analysis of recombinant LjALDH9, we found that the most suitable reaction conditions were pH7.0, 16-23 °C and Mn(2+) as the activator. Our study provides theoretical proof that LjALDH9 plays an important role in the parasitic life phase of lamprey.	2015 Jun	Zhao Chunhui,Wang Dan,Feng Bin,Gou Meng,Liu Xin,Li Qingwei	Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

25986322	High-yield reactivation of anionic tobacco peroxidase overexpressed in Escherichia coli.	Anionic tobacco peroxidase (TOP) is extremely active in chemiluminescence reaction of luminol oxidation without addition of enhancers and more stable than horseradish peroxidase under antibody conjugation conditions. In addition, recombinant TOP (rTOP) produced in Escherichia coli is known to be a perfect direct electron transfer catalyst on electrodes of various origin. These features make the task of development of a high-yield reactivation protocol for rTOP practically important. Previous attempts to reactivate the enzyme from E. coli inclusion bodies were successful, but the reported reactivation yield was only 14%. In this work, we thoroughly screened the refolding conditions for dilution protocol and compared it with gel-filtration chromatography. The impressive reactivation yield in the dilution protocol (85%) was achieved for 8 μg/mL solubilized rTOP protein and the refolding medium containing 0.3 mM oxidized glutathione, 0.05 mM dithiothreitol, 5 mM CaCl2, 5 0lycerol in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.6, with 1 μM hemin added at the 24th hour of incubation. A practically important discovery was a 30-40 0ncrease in the reactivation yield upon delayed addition of hemin. The reactivation yield achieved is one of the highest reported in the literature on protein refolding by dilution. The final yield of purified active non-glycosylated rTOP was ca. 60 mg per L of E. coli culture, close to the yield reported before for tomato and tobacco plants overexpressing glycosylated TOP (60 mg/kg biomass) and much higher than for the previously reported refolding protocol (2.6 mg per L of E. coli culture).	2015 Jun	Zakharova G S,Poloznikov A A,Chubar T A,Gazaryan I G,Tishkov V I	Protein expression and purification. 113 85-93	Anionic tobacco peroxidase (TOP)	ELSATFYDTTCPNVTSIVRGVMDQRQRTDARAGAKIIRLHFHDCFVNGCDGSILLDTDGTQTEKDAPANVGAGGFDIVDDIKTALENVCPGVVSCADILALASEIGVVLAKGPSWQVLFGRKDSLTANRSGANSDIPSPFETLAVMIPQFTNKGMDLTDLVALSGAHTFGRARCGTFEQRLFNFNGSGNPDLTVDATFLQTLQGICPQGGNNGNTFTNLDISTPNDFDNDYFTNLQSNQGLLQTDQELFSTSGSATIAIVNRYAGSQTQFFDDFVSSMIKLGNISPLTGTNGQIRTDCKRVN	23-324	P11965	Removal of H2O2, oxidation of toxic reductants, biosynthesis and degradation of lignin, suberization, auxin catabolism, response to environmental stresses such as wounding, pathogen attack and oxidative stress.

26003526	Expression and purification of biologically active recombinant human paraoxonase 1 from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli.	Human PON1 (h-PON1) is a Ca(2+)-dependent serum enzyme and can hydrolyze (and inactivate) a wide range of substrates. It is a multifaceted enzyme and exhibit anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-atherogenic, anti-diabetic, anti-microbial, and organophosphate (OP)-detoxifying properties. Thus, h-PON1 is a strong candidate for the development of therapeutic intervention against these conditions in humans. Insufficient hydrolyzing activity of native h-PON1 against desirable substrate affirms the urgent need to develop improved variant(s) of h-PON1 having enhanced activity. Production of recombinant h-PON1 (rh-PON1) using an Escherichia coli expression system is a key to develop such variant(s). However, generation of rh-PON1 using E. coli expression system has been elusive until now because of the aggregation of over-expressed rh-PON1 protein in inactive form as inclusion bodies (IBs) in the bacterial cells. In this study, we have over-expressed rh-PON1(wt) and rh-PON1(H115W;R192K) proteins as IBs in E. coli, and refolded the inactive enzymes present in the IBs to their active form using in vitro refolding. The active enzymes were isolated from the refolding mixture by ion-exchange chromatography. The catalytic properties of the refolded enzymes were similar to their soluble counterparts. Our results show that the pure and the active variant of rh-PON1 enzyme having enhanced hydrolyzing activity can be produced in large quantities using E. coli expression system. This method can be used for the industrial scale production of rh-PON1 enzymes and will aid in developing h-PON1 as a therapeutic candidate.	2015 Sep	Bajaj Priyanka,Tripathy Rajan K,Aggarwal Geetika,Pande Abhay H	Protein expression and purification. 115 95-101	h-PON1	MAKLIALTLLGMGLALFRNHQSSYQTRLNALREVQPVELPNCNLVKGIETGSEDLEILPNGLAFISSGLKYPGIKSFNPNSPGKILLMDLNEEDPTVLELGITGSKFDVSSFNPHGISTFTDEDNAMYLLVVNHPDAKSTVELFKFQEEEKSLLHLKTIRHKLLPNLNDIVAVGPEHFYGTNDHYFLDPYLQSWEMYLGLAWSYVVYYSPSEVRVVAEGFDFANGINISPDGKYVYIAELLAHKIHVYEKHANWTLTPLKSLDFNTLVDNISVDPETGDLWVGCHPNGMKIFFYDSENPPASEVLRIQNILTEEPKVTQVYAENGTVLQGSTVASVYKGKLLIGTVFHKALYCEL		P27169	Human PON1 (h-PON1) is a Ca2+-dependent serum enzyme and can hydrolyze (and inactivate) a wide range of substrates.

26016666	Modulating bilayer mechanical properties to promote the coupled folding and insertion of an integral membrane protein.	Bilayer mechanical properties are not only of crucial importance to the mechanism of action of mechanosensation in lipid membranes but also affect preparative laboratory tasks such as membrane-protein refolding. We report this for coupled refolding and bilayer insertion of outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA), an integral membrane enzyme that catalyses the hydrolytic cleavage of glycerophospholipids. OmpLA can be refolded into a variety of detergent micelles and unilamellar vesicles composed of short-chain phospholipids but, in the absence of chemical or molecular chaperones, not into thicker membranes. Controlled modulation of bilayer mechanical properties by judicious use of subsolubilising concentrations of detergents induces monolayer curvature strain, acyl chain fluidisation, membrane thinning, and transient aqueous bilayer defects. This enables quantitative and functional refolding of OmpLA even into bilayer membranes composed of long-chain phospholipids to yield enzymatically active proteoliposomes without requiring membrane solubilisation.	2015 Sep	Herrmann Michaela,Danielczak Bartholomäus,Textor Martin,Klement Jessica,Keller Sandro	European biophysics journal : EBJ. 44(7) 503-12	outer membrane phospholipase A (OmpLA)	QEATVKEVHDAPAVRGSIIANMLQEHDNPFTLYPYDTNYLIYTQTSDLNKEAIASYDWAENARKDEVKFQLSLAFPLWRGILGPNSVLGASYTQKSWWQLSNSEESSPFRETNYEPQLFLGFATDYRFAGWTLRDVEMGYNHDSNGRSDPTSRSWNRLYTRLMAENGNWLVEVKPWYVVGNTDDNPDITKYMGYYQLKIGYHLGDAVLSAKGQYNWNTGYGGAELGLSYPITKHVRLYTQVYSGYGESLIDYNFNQTRVGVGVMLNDLF	without signal peptide	P0A921	Hydrolase		8.3	50	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
26050651	Characterization of the 4,6-α-glucanotransferase GTFB enzyme of Lactobacillus reuteri 121 isolated from inclusion bodies.	BACKGROUND:The GTFB enzyme of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri 121 is a 4,6-α-glucanotransferase of glycoside hydrolase family 70 (GH70; http://www.cazy.org ). Contrary to the glucansucrases in GH70, GTFB is unable to use sucrose as substrate, but instead converts malto-oligosaccharides and starch into isomalto-/malto- polymers that may find application as prebiotics and dietary fibers. The GTFB enzyme expresses well in Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3), but mostly accumulates in inclusion bodies (IBs) which generally contain wrongly folded protein and inactive enzyme.METHODS:Denaturation followed by refolding, as well as ncIB preparation were used for isolation of active GTFB protein from inclusion bodies. Soluble, refolded and ncIB GTFB were compared using activity assays, secondary structure analysis by FT-IR, and product analyses by NMR, HPAEC and SEC.RESULTS:Expression of GTFB in E. coli yielded &gt; 100 mg/l relatively pure and active but mostly insoluble GTFB protein in IBs, regardless of the expression conditions used. Following denaturing, refolding of GTFB protein was most efficient in double distilled H2O. Also, GTFB ncIBs were active, with approx. 10 0f hydrolysis activity compared to the soluble protein. When expressed as units of activity obtained per liter E. coli culture, the total amount of ncIB GTFB expressed possessed around 180 % hydrolysis activity and 100 % transferase activity compared to the amount of soluble GTFB enzyme obtained from one liter culture. The product profiles obtained for the three GTFB enzyme preparations were similar when analyzed by HPAEC and NMR. SEC investigation also showed that these 3 enzyme preparations yielded products with similar size distributions. FT-IR analysis revealed extended β-sheet formation in ncIB GTFB providing an explanation at the molecular level for reduced GTFB activity in ncIBs. The thermostability of ncIB GTFB was relatively high compared to the soluble and refolded GTFB.CONCLUSION:In view of their relatively high yield, activity and high thermostability, both refolded and ncIB GTFB derived from IBs in E. coli may find industrial application in the synthesis of modified starches.	2015 Jun	Bai Yuxiang,van der Kaaij Rachel Maria,Woortman Albert Jan Jacob,Jin Zhengyu,Dijkhuizen Lubbert	BMC biotechnology. 15 49	4,6-α-glucanotransferase (GTFB)	MELKKHFKLYKSGKQWVTAAVATIAFSAGVLTTSEVVHADTNTGDQQTEQVTQPSNSTTQDVKPVSTDASSDTKIVSDNKENNNQVGNTNVSGQNSSKDTKSVLTGTNSVTQNYDHNDNGNYGYIDSANLNNNQLQVSGWSATNQNINKDNHFIIAYDSTSQQELGRTKVETPVARPDVKAVHNVYNAENSGFNVNVSLNFDKMNNYRDAIKIISRYSGVPDGNSDYVDFVSQPIIFDENNYAHLDDFSVQNGKLHVSGWNATNKAIQNPNHFLILFDRTINREVARQKVTAGINRPDVEKAYPQVINANISGFDAAFDITTLNPNDEYQILSRYSNDDNGEGSYVTYWFKPQRIAPANQFNSGHLDSFNISKAGKVTVSGWQATNLSNIQSNRFIILFDNTANHQIASTKITNTARPDVEKVYPQVLNATNSGYDVTFDLTQDQIAQLLPNHSYSIVSRYSADANGNGNDKQHTDFWSTPITLNKTASYIDSISLNGNELNVRGWMASDASATQANPYLIVLNNGKEVTRQKLTLVARPDVAKVYPDVYSSLDSGFNTTIKLTVPQLNELTGNMQVLLRYSTAADGNPINNGGFTDQYSKNYATNGGSFDFVKVDNNQVAFSGWHVSDQATDKPYQWIIVLANGKEVGRQLISSTTNGFVSYNRPDVYNVNPAISNSSTSGFQGIMTLKDNIKNANVQLVHRFSDDGQNGEGNRVDYWSEVMPVTNTFQKGTDQLMRNLVAKPNKNQLKIYNGNTLVKTLGPGTWENMAFAQDSSAINNIDGYLSYTDWYRPYGTSQDGKTWYKTTAMDWRPLLMYIWPSKDVQAQFIKYFVNNGYENANYGLTKDTVANINKDTNTTVLANMAQNLRYVIEQSIAANKGTSKLANDINSFAATVPELSASSELSLQSMPNYRPDKSGTIDSDQVIFVNNNSKDPRKGNTSYADSNYRLMNRTINNQAGNNNSDNSPELLVGNDIDNSNPVVQAENLNWEYFLLNYGKLMGYNPDGNFDGFRVDAADNIDADVLDQMGQLMNDMYHTKGNPQNANDHLSYNEGYHSGAAQMLNEKGNPQLYMDSGEFYTLENVLGRANNRDNIGNLITNSIVNRQNDTTENEATPNWSFVTNHDQRKNLINRLIIKDHSNIPDIMGSAYKVEYANQAWQEFYADQEKTNKQYAQYNVPAQYAILLSNKDTVPQVYYGDLYNETAQYMQEKSIYYDAITTLMRARKQFVSGGQTMTKLNNNLLASVRYGKGVVDANSNGTDKLSRTSGMAVLVGNDSNMAQQSVAINMGRAHANQQYRNLIDTTENGLTYDADNSENPAILTTDSNGILKVTVKGYSNPYVSGYLGVWVPVISGDQDVTTNASDVVANKEKTFESNAALDSHMIYEDFSLFQPEPTSVENHAYNVIAKNASLFSDLGITDFWMAPAYTPFGRSRYNEGYSMTDRYNLGTTANPTKYGSGEELANTIAALHKAGLKVQEDIVMNQMIGFSGQEAVTVTRTNNRGMQIHVNGQTYANQIYFAYTTGGGNGQETYGGKYLAELQKNYPDLFTTKAISTGVAPDPTVRINKWSAKYQNGTSLQNIGIGLAVKLANGDYAYLNSGDNKAFNTLLPTAISLNFNN	C-terminal His6 tag	Q5SBM0	dextransucrase		7.0	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
26057794	Purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of the Escherichia coli common pilus chaperone EcpB.	Pili are key cell-surface components that allow the attachment of bacteria to both biological and abiotic solid surfaces, whilst also mediating interactions between themselves. In Escherichia coli, the common pilus (Ecp) belongs to an alternative chaperone-usher (CU) pathway that plays a major role in both early biofilm formation and host-cell adhesion. The chaperone EcpB is involved in the biogenesis of the filament, which is composed of EcpA and EcpD. Initial attempts at crystallizing EcpB using natively purified protein from the bacterial periplasm were not successful; however, after the isolation of EcpB under denaturing conditions and subsequent refolding, crystals were obtained at pH 8.0 using the sitting-drop method of vapour diffusion. Diffraction data have been processed to 2.4 Å resolution. These crystals belonged to the trigonal space group P3(1)21 or P3(2)21, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 62.65, c = 121.14 Å and one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Molecular replacement was unsuccessful, but selenomethionine-substituted protein and heavy-atom derivatives are being prepared for phasing. The three-dimensional structure of EcpB will provide invaluable information on the subtle mechanistic differences in biogenesis between the alternative and classical CU pathways. Furthermore, this is the first time that this refolding strategy has been used to purify CU chaperones, and it could be implemented in similar systems where it has not been possible to obtain highly ordered crystals.	2015 Jun	Garnett James A,Diallo Mamou,Matthews Steve J	Acta crystallographica.

26072465	Strategy for linker selection to enhance refolding and bioactivity of VAS-TRAIL fusion protein based on inclusion body conformation and activity.	A bifunctional fusion protein, VAS-TRAIL, was designed for superior therapeutic efficacy by combining anti-angiogenesis activity with tumor-selective apoptosis activity. The protein was expressed as inclusion body (IB) in Escherichia coli. To enhance refolding yield and bioactivity, four fusions were constructed with different linkers (no linker, flexible linker, rigid linker, and helix-forming linker). A novel linker selection strategy based on IB conformational quality and activity was applied to predict the suitable linker. The conformational quality and activity of VAS-TRAIL IBs were analyzed by ATR-FTIR and cytotoxicity assay, respectively. Results demonstrated that aggregated VRT (fusion with rigid linker) contained the highest native-like β structure content and retained part of the expected activity, namely, cytotoxicity activity on tumor cells. This finding suggested that the rigid linker was the most suitable candidate. Further results of in vitro refolding and subsequent circular dichroism and activity assay of four refolded fusions were significantly correlated with the predictions. Refolding of VRT yielded more soluble proteins containing the expected secondary structure and the highest bioactivity compared with that of other fusions. Our research may offer an efficient method for the high-throughput design of aggregated-prone therapeutic fusion protein.	2015 Aug	Fan Jiying,Huang Liying,Sun Jing,Qiu Yi,Zhou Jinsong,Shen Yaling	Journal of biotechnology. 209 16-22	TRAIL	VRERGPQRVAAHITGTRGRSNTLSSPNSKNEKALGRKINSWESSRSGHSFLSNLHLRNGELVIHEKGFYYIYSQTYFRFQEEIKENTKNDKQMVQYIYKYTSYPDPILLMKSARNSCWSKDAEYGLYSIYQGGIFELKENDRIFVSVTNEHLIDMDHEASFFGAFLVG	The sTRAIL 114–281 domain was joined to the carboxyl terminal of the vasostatin 120–180 domain with the peptide linker (PAPAP)3.

26139616	Large-Scale Refolding and Enzyme Reaction of Human Preproinsulin for Production of Human Insulin.	Human insulin is composed of 21 amino acids of an A-chain and 30 amino acids of a B-chain. This is the protein hormone that has the role of blood sugar control. When the recombinant human proinsulin is expressed in Escherichia coli, a serious problem is the formation of an inclusion body. Therefore, the inclusion body must be denatured and refolded under chaotropic agents and suitable reductants. In this study, H27R-proinsulin was refolded from the denatured form with β-mercaptoethanol and urea. The refolding reaction was completed after 15 h at 15°C, whereas the reaction at 25°C was faster than that at 15°C. The refolding yield at 15°C was 17 0gher than that at 25°C. The refolding reaction could be carried out at a high protein concentration (2 g/l) using direct refolding without sulfonation. The most economical and optimal refolding condition for human preproinsulin was 1.5 g/l protein, 10 mM glycine buffer containing 0.6 M urea, pH 10.6, and 0.3 mM β-mercaptoethanol at 15°C for 16 h. The maximum refolding yield was 74.8% at 15°C with 1.5 g/l protein. Moreover, the refolded preproinsulin could be converted into normal mature insulin with two enzymes. The average amount of human insulin was 138.2 g from 200 L of fermentation broth after enzyme reaction with H27R-proinsulin. The direct refolding process for H27R-proinsulin was successfully set up without sulfonation. The step yields for refolding and enzyme reaction were comparatively high. Therefore, our refolding process for production of recombinant insulin may be beneficial to the large-scale production of other biologically active proteins.	2015 Oct	Kim Chang-Kyu,Lee Seung-Bae,Son Young-Jin	Journal of microbiology and biotechnology. 25(10) 1742-50	proinsulin	FVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTPKTRREAEDLQVGQVELGGGPGAGSLQPLALEGSLQKRGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN	N-terminal His10 tag(MTMITNSPEISHHHHHHHHHHQLISEAR-proinsulin), without signalpeptide	P01308	hormone		10.6	15	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
26198801	Sperm Lysozyme-Like Protein 1 (SLLP1), an intra-acrosomal oolemmal-binding sperm protein, reveals filamentous organization in protein crystal form.	Sperm lysozyme-like protein 1 (SLLP1) is one of the lysozyme-like proteins predominantly expressed in mammalian testes that lacks bacteriolytic activity, localizes in the sperm acrosome, and exhibits high affinity for an oolemmal receptor, SAS1B. The crystal structure of mouse SLLP1 (mSLLP1) was determined at 2.15 Å resolution. mSLLP1 monomer adopts a structural fold similar to that of chicken/mouse lysozymes retaining all four canonical disulfide bonds. mSLLP1 is distinct from c-lysozyme by substituting two essential catalytic residues (E35T/D52N), exhibiting different surface charge distribution, and by forming helical filaments approximately 75 Å in diameter with a 25 Å central pore comprised of six monomers per helix turn repeating every 33 Å. Cross-species alignment of all reported SLLP1 sequences revealed a set of invariant surface regions comprising a characteristic fingerprint uniquely identifying SLLP1 from other c-lysozyme family members. The fingerprint surface regions reside around the lips of the putative glycan-binding groove including three polar residues (Y33/E46/H113). A flexible salt bridge (E46-R61) was observed covering the glycan-binding groove. The conservation of these regions may be linked to their involvement in oolemmal protein binding. Interaction between SLLP1 monomer and its oolemmal receptor SAS1B was modeled using protein-protein docking algorithms, utilizing the SLLP1 fingerprint regions along with the SAS1B conserved surface regions. This computational model revealed complementarity between the conserved SLLP1/SAS1B interacting surfaces supporting the experimentally observed SLLP1/SAS1B interaction involved in fertilization.	2015 Jul	Zheng H,Mandal A,Shumilin I A,Chordia M D,Panneerdoss S,Herr J C,Minor W	Andrology. 3(4) 756-71	Sperm Lysozyme-Like Protein 1	AKVFSRCELAKEMHDFGLDGYRGYNLADWVCLAYYTSGFNTNAVDHEADGSTNNGIFQISSRRWCRTLASNGPNLCRIYCTDLLNNDLKDSIVCAMKIVQEPLGLGYWEAWRHHCQGRDLSDWVDGCDF	C-terminal His6 tag, 93-221	Q9D9X8	lysozyme	Extracellular domain	8.5		t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	t	t
26272369	Expression, purification, refolding, and enzymatic characterization of two secretory phospholipases A₂ from Neurospora crassa.	Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) catalyzes the hydrolysis of sn-2 linkage in the glycerophospholipid, thereby releasing fatty acid and 1-acyl lysophospholipid. Among sPLA2s from various organisms and tissues, group XIV fungal/bacterial sPLA2s are relatively less characterized compared to their mammalian counterparts. Here we report cloning, recombinant expression, refolding, and enzymatic characterization of two sPLA2s, NCU06650 and NCU09423, from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. The hexahistidine-tagged putative mature region of both proteins was expressed in Escherichia coli. Inclusion bodies were solubilized using a high hydrostatic pressure refolding technique. NCU06650 was solubilized without any additives at alkaline pH, and the addition of arginine or non-detergent sulfobetain (NDSB) significantly improved the process at acidic pH. In contrast, NCU09423 was solubilized only when NDSB was added at alkaline pH. Both enzymes displayed a Ca(2+)-dependent lipolytic activity toward E. coli membrane. Mass spectrometry analysis using the synthetic phospholipids as substrates demonstrated that both enzymes preferentially cleaved the sn-2 ester linkage of substrates and generated 1-acyl lysophospholipids, demonstrating that they are bona fide PLA2.	2015 Sep	Takayanagi Ayumi,Miyakawa Takuya,Asano Atsuko,Ohtsuka Jun,Tanokura Masaru,Arioka Manabu	Protein expression and purification. 115 69-75	Secretory phospholipase A2 NCU06650	MRGSHHHHHHGMASMTGGQQMGRDLYDDDDKDPSSRSWTGSESDSTGADSLFRRAETIQQTTDRYLFRITLPQFTAYRNARSPATLDWSSDSCSYSPDNPLGFPFSPACNRHDFGYRNYKAQSRFTDNNKLKIDGNFKTDLYYQCDTHGYGSTCHALANVYYAAVREFGRTKGELQEEYDLLLAHYNELVAEAIAKGEDPLYY	N-His6-tagged	Q1K6W0	Phospholipase A2	full length	8	room temperature	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f

26278820	One-step extraction of functional recombinant aquaporin Z from inclusion bodies with optimal detergent.	Aquaporins are integral membrane channel proteins found in all kingdoms of life. The Escherichia coli aquaporin Z (AqpZ) has been shown to solely conduct water at high permeability. Functional AqpZ is generally purified from the membrane fraction. However, the quantity of the purified protein is limited. In this study, a new method is developed to achieve high yield of bioactive AqpZ protein. A mild detergent n-dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM) was used to solubilize the over-expressed insoluble AqpZ from inclusion bodies without a refolding process. The recovered AqpZ protein showed high water permeability comparable with AqpZ obtained from the membrane fraction. In this way, the total yield of bioactive AqpZ has been increased greatly, which will facilitate the structural and functional characterization and future applications of AqpZ.	2015 Sep	Wang Lili,Zhou Hu,Li Zhengjun,Lim Teck Kwang,Lim Xin Shan,Lin Qingsong	Protein expression and purification. 115 146-52	aquaporin Z	MFRKLAAECFGTFWLVFGGCGSAVLAAGFPELGIGFAGVALAFGLTVLTMAFAVGHISGGHFNPAVTIGLWAGGRFPAKEVVGYVIAQVVGGIVAAALLYLIASGKTGFDAAASGFASNGYGEHSPGGYSMLSALVVELVLSAGFLLVIHGATDKFAPAGFAPIAIGLALTLIHLISIPVTNTSVNPARSTAVAIFQGGWALEQLWFFWVVPIVGGIIGGLIYRTLLEKRD	The protein has an N-terminal 6× His affinity tag, but the amino acid sequence of the tag is not indicated in the paper.

26339260	Recombinant production of mecasermin in E. coli expression system.	Human Insulin-like growth factor 1 (hIGF-1) consists of 70 amino acids in a single chain with three intermolecular disulfide bridges possessing valuable therapeutic effects. To date, numerous variants of specifically engineered hIGF-1 have been produced so as to improve hIGF-1 biological activity, stability and stronger binding to IGF-1 receptor. Mecasermin is one of the modified variants with one amino acid substitution near the N-terminal (T4I) approved for the treatment of growth failure diabetes, wound healing, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and severe primary IGF-1 deficiency. No scientific report for recombinant production of mecasermin in Escherichia coli (E. coli) expression system has been sofar reported. In the present study, we therefore investigated the overexpression of mecasermin in two different E. coli strains in order to obtain higher yield of recombinant protein. To achieve this goal, mecasermin DNA encoding sequence was designed based on polypeptide sequence, optimized according to E. coli codon preference, and cloned in pET15b. Recombinant vector, pET15-mecasermin, transferred into two E. coli strains rigami B (DE3) and BL21 (DE3) and induced for expression in a small scale. Results revealed the E. coli Origami B (DE3) expression system was a preferable host for mecasermin production due to its high expression level being around twice as much as BL21 (DE3). Large scale mecasermin production was performed in batch culture and produced recombinant protein specifically confirmed by western blotting and mass spectroscopy. Since major part of recombinant mecasermin was expressed as inclusion body, isolation and refolding was accomplished through developed purification procedure, and finally recombinant protein was successfully purified by gel filtration chromatography.	2015 Sep	Jafari S,Babaeipour V,Seyedi H A Eslampanah,Rahaie M,Mofid M R,Haddad L,Namvaran M M,Fallah J	Research in pharmaceutical sciences. 9(6) 453-61	mecasermin	GPEILCGAELVDALQFVCGDRGFYFNKPTGYGSSSRRAPQTGIVDECCFRSCDLRRLEMYCAPLKPAKSA	T4I mutanat, N-terminal His6 tag	P05019	hormone		8.0	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
26358405	Efficient refolding of the bifunctional therapeutic fusion protein VAS-TRAIL by a triple agent solution.	VAS-TRAIL is a bifunctional fusion protein that combines anti-angiogenic activity with tumor-selective apoptotic activity for enhanced anti-tumor efficacy. VAS-TRAIL is expressed as inclusion body in Escherichia coli, but protein refolding is difficult to achieve and results in low yields of bioactive protein. In this study, we describe an efficient method for VAS-TRAIL refolding. The solubilization of aggregated VAS-TRAIL was achieved by a triple agent solution, which consists of an alkaline solution (pH 11.5) containing 0.4M l-arginine and 2M urea. The solubilized protein showed high purity and preserved secondary structure according to fluorescence properties. VAS-TRAIL refolding was performed through stepwise dialysis and resulted in more than 50% recovery of the soluble protein. The function of l-arginine was additive with alkaline pH, as shown by the significant improvement in refolding yield (≈30%) by l-arginine-containing solubilization solutions compared with alkaline solubilization solutions without l-arginine. The refolded VAS-TRAIL also showed β-sheet structures and the propensity for oligomerization. Bioassays showed that the refolded fusion protein exhibited the expected activities, including its apoptotic activities toward tumor and endothelial cells, which proposed its promising therapeutic potential.	2016 Jul	Fan Jiying,Wang Zhanqing,Huang Liying,Shen Yaling	Protein expression and purification. 125 68-73	TRAIL	VRERGPQRVAAHITGTRGRSNTLSSPNSKNEKALGRKINSWESSRSGHSFLSNLHLRNGELVIHEKGFYYIYSQTYFRFQEEIKENTKNDKQMVQYIYKYTSYPDPILLMKSARNSCWSKDAEYGLYSIYQGGIFELKENDRIFVSVTNEHLIDMDHEASFFGAFLVG	The sTRAIL 114–281 domain was joined to the carboxyl terminal of the vasostatin 120–180 domain with the peptide linker (PAPAP)3.

26378460	Interdomain Contacts and the Stability of Serralysin Protease from Serratia marcescens.	The serralysin family of bacterial metalloproteases is associated with virulence in multiple modes of infection. These extracellular proteases are members of the Repeats-in-ToXin (RTX) family of toxins and virulence factors, which mediated virulence in E. coli, B. pertussis, and P. aeruginosa, as well as other animal and plant pathogens. The serralysin proteases are structurally dynamic and their folding is regulated by calcium binding to a C-terminal domain that defines the RTX family of proteins. Previous studies have suggested that interactions between N-terminal sequences and this C-terminal domain are important for the high thermal and chemical stabilities of the RTX proteases. Extending from this, stabilization of these interactions in the native structure may lead to hyperstabilization of the folded protein. To test this hypothesis, cysteine pairs were introduced into the N-terminal helix and the RTX domain and protease folding and activity were assessed. Under stringent pH and temperature conditions, the disulfide-bonded mutant showed increased protease activity and stability. This activity was dependent on the redox environment of the refolding reaction and could be blocked by selective modification of the cysteine residues before protease refolding. These data demonstrate that the thermal and chemical stability of these proteases is, in part, mediated by binding between the RTX domain and the N-terminal helix and demonstrate that stabilization of this interaction can further stabilize the active protease, leading to additional pH and thermal tolerance.	2015 Sep	Zhang Liang,Morrison Anneliese J,Thibodeau Patrick H	PloS one. 10(9) e0138419	Serralysin Protease	AATTGYDAVDDLLHYHERGNGIQINGKDSFSNEQAGLFITRENQTWNGYKVFGQPVKLTFSFPDYKFSSTNVAGDTGLSKFSAEQQQQAKLSLQSWADVANITFTEVAAGQKANITFGNYSQDRPGHYDYGTQAYAFLPNTIWQGQDLGGQTWYNVNQSNVKHPATEDYGRQTFTHEIGHALGLSHPGDYNAGEGNPTYNDVTYAEDTRQFSLMSYWSETNTGGDNGGHYAAAPLLDDIAAIQHLYGANPSTRTGDTVYGFNSNTGRDFLSTTSNSQKVIFAAWDAGGNDTFDFSGYTANQRINLNEKSFSDVGGLKGNVSIAAGVTIENAIGGSGNDVIVGNAANNVLKGGAGNDVLFGGGGADELWGGAGKDIFVFSAASDSAPGASDWIRDFQKGIDKIDLSFFNKEANSSDFIHFVDHFSGTAGEALLSYNASSNVTDLSVNIGGHQAPDFLVKIVGQVDVATDFIV	N-terminal His6 tag, without signal peptide	P23694	protease		6.8	0	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	t	f	f	f

26390939	Purification of recombinant ovalbumin from inclusion bodies of Escherichia coli.	Recombinant ovalbumin expressed in bacterial host is essentially free from post-translational modifications and can be useful in understanding the structure-function relationship of the protein. In this study, ovalbumin was expressed in Escherichia coli in the form of inclusion bodies. Ovalbumin inclusion bodies were solubilized using urea and refolded by decreasing the urea concentration by dilution. Refolded protein was purified by anion exchange chromatography. Overall recovery of purified recombinant ovalbumin from inclusion bodies was about 30% with 981fb7850urity. Purified recombinant ovalbumin was characterized by mass spectrometry, circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. Recombinant ovalbumin was shown to be resistant to trypsin using protease resistance assay. This indicated proper refolding of ovalbumin from inclusion bodies of E. coli. This method provides a simple way of producing ovalbumin free of post-translational modifications.	2015 Dec	Upadhyay Vaibhav,Singh Anupam,Panda Amulya K	Protein expression and purification. 117 52-8	ovalbumin	MGSIGAASMEFCFDVFKELKVHHANENIFYCPIAIMSALAMVYLGAKDSTRTQINKVVRFDKLPGFGDSIEAQCGTSVNVHSSLRDILNQITKPNDVYSFSLASRLYAEERYPILPEYLQCVKELYRGGLEPINFQTAADQARELINSWVESQTNGIIRNVLQPSSVDSQTAMVLVNAIVFKGLWEKAFKDEDTQAMPFRVTEQESKPVQMMYQIGLFRVASMASEKMKILELPFASGTMSMLVLLPDEVSGLEQLESIINFEKLTEWTSSNVMEERKIKVYLPRMKMEEKYNLTSVLMAMGITDVFSSSANLSGISSAESLKISQAVHAAHAEINEAGREVVGSAEAGVDAASVSEEFRADHPFLFCIKHIATNAVLFFGRCVSP		P01012			8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	t	f	f	f
26435421	Membrane composition influences the activity of in vitro refolded human vitamin K epoxide reductase.	Human vitamin K epoxide reductase (hVKOR) is an integral membrane protein responsible for the maintenance of reduced vitamin K pools, a prerequisite for the action of γ-glutamyl carboxylase and hence for hemostasis. Here we describe the recombinant expression of hVKOR as an insoluble fusion protein in Escherichia coli, followed by purification and chemical cleavage under denaturing conditions. In vitro renaturation and reconstitution of purified solubilized hVKOR in phospholipids could be established to yield active protein. Crucially, the renatured enzyme is inhibited by the powerful coumarin anticoagulant warfarin, and we demonstrate that enzyme activity depends on lipid composition. The completely synthetic system for protein production allows a rational investigation of the multiple variables in membrane protein folding and paves the way for the provision of pure, active membrane protein for structural studies.	2015 Oct	Jaenecke Frank,Friedrich-Epler Beatrice,Parthier Christoph,Stubbs Milton T	Biochemistry. 54(42) 6454-61	vitamin K epoxide reductase	MGSTWGSPGWVRLALCLTGLVLSLYALHVKAARARDRDYRALCDVGTAISCSRVFSSRWGRGFGLVEHVLGQDSILNQSNSIFGCIFYTLQLLLGCLRTRWASVLMLLSSLVSLAGSVYLAWILFFVLYDFCIVCITTYAINVSLMWLSFRKVQEPQGKAKRH	C-tarminal His6 tag	Q9BQB6	Oxidoreductase	full length	8.3	room temperature	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
26447598	Recombinant expression, in vitro refolding and characterizing disulfide bonds of a mouse inhibitory C-type lectin-like receptor Nkrp1b.	As a part of the innate immunity, NK (Natural Killer) cells provide an early immune response to different stimuli, e.g. viral infections and tumor growths. However, their functions are more complex; they play an important role in reproduction, alloimmunity, autoimmunity and allergic diseases. NK cell activities require an intricate system of regulation that is ensured by many different receptors on a cell surface which integrate signals from interacting cells and soluble factors. One way to understand NK cell biology is through the structure of NK receptors, which can reveal ligand binding conditions. We present a modified protocol for recombinant expression in Escherichia coli and in vitro refolding of the ligand-binding domain of the inhibitory Nkrp1b (SJL/J) protein. Nkrp1b identity and folding was confirmed using mass spectrometry (accurate mass of the intact protein and evaluation of disulfide bonds) and one-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The intention is to provide the basis for conducting structural studies of the inhibitory Nkrp1b protein, since only the activating Nkrp1a receptor structure is known.	2015 Oct	Hernychová L,Mrázek H,Ivanova L,Kukačka Z,Chmelík J,Novák P	Physiological research / Academia Scientiarum Bohemoslovaca. 64 Suppl 1 S85-93	C-Type Lectin-Like Receptor	MDSTTLVYADLNLARIQEPKHDSPPSLSPDTCRCPRWHRLALKFGCAGLILLVLVVIGLCVLVLSVQKSSVQKICADVQENRTHTTDCSVNLECPQDWLSHRDKCFRVFQVSNTWEEGQADCGRKGATLLLIQDQEELRFLLDSIKEKYNSFWIGLRFTLPDMNWKWINGTTFNSDVLKITGDTENGSCASISGDKVTSESCSTDNRWICQKELNHETPSNDS	N-terminal His6 tag	P27812	Receptor	full length	8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
26472319	In vitro refolding with simultaneous purification of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH 1-34) from Escherichia coli directed by protein folding size exclusion chromatography (PF-SEC): implication of solution additives and their role on aggregates and renaturation.	Recombinant proteins are frequently hampered by aggregation during the refolding and purification process. A simple and rapid method for in vitro refolding and purification of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH 1-34) expressed in Escherichia coli with protein folding size exclusion chromatography (PF-SEC) was developed in the present work. Discrete effects of potential solution additives such as urea, polypolyethylene glycol, proline, and maltose on the refolding with simultaneous purification of rhPTH were investigated. The results of individual additives indicated that both maltose and proline had remarkable influences on the efficiency of refolding with a recovery yield of 65 and 66% respectively. Further, the synergistic effect of these additives on refolding was also explored. These results demonstrate that the additive combinations are more effective for inhibiting protein aggregation during purification of rhPTH in terms of recovery yield, purity, and specific activity. The maltose and proline combination system achieved the highest renatured rhPTH having a recovery yield of 78%, a purity of ≥99%, and a specific activity of 3.31 × 10(3) cAMP pM/cell respectively, when compared to the classical dilution method yield (41%) and purity (97%). In addition, the role of maltose and proline in a combined system on protein aggregation and refolding has been explained. The molecular docking (in silico) scores of maltose (-10.91) and proline (-9.0) support the in vitro results.	2016 Feb	Vemula Sandeep,Vemula Sushma,Dedaniya Akshay,Ronda Srinivasa Reddy	Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry. 408(1) 217-29	Parathyroid hormone	SVSEIQLMHNLGKHLNSMERVEWLRKKLQDVHNF	32-65 aa	P01270	hormone		8.5	20	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	t	t	t	f	f	f	f
26487717	N-helix and Cysteines Inter-regulate Human Mitochondrial VDAC-2 Function and Biochemistry.	Human voltage-dependent anion channel-2 (hVDAC-2) functions primarily as the crucial anti-apoptotic protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane, and additionally as a gated bidirectional metabolite transporter. The N-terminal helix (NTH), involved in voltage sensing, bears an additional 11-residue extension (NTE) only in hVDAC-2. In this study, we assign a unique role for the NTE as influencing the chaperone-independent refolding kinetics and overall thermodynamic stability of hVDAC-2. Our electrophysiology data shows that the N-helix is crucial for channel activity, whereas NTE sensitizes this isoform to voltage gating. Additionally, hVDAC-2 possesses the highest cysteine content, possibly for regulating reactive oxygen species content. We identify interdependent contributions of the N-helix and cysteines to channel function, and the measured stability in micellar environments with differing physicochemical properties. The evolutionary demand for the NTE in the presence of cysteines clearly emerges from our biochemical and functional studies, providing insight into factors that functionally demarcate hVDAC-2 from the other VDACs.	2015 Dec	Maurya Svetlana Rajkumar,Mahalakshmi Radhakrishnan	The Journal of biological chemistry. 290(51) 30240-52	voltage-dependent anion channel-2	MATHGQTCARPMCIPPSYADLGKAARDIFNKGFGFGLVKLDVKTKSCSGVEFSTSGSSNTDTGKVTGTLETKYKWCEYGLTFTEKWNTDNTLGTEIAIEDQICQGLKLTFDTTFSPNTGKKSGKIKSSYKRECINLGCDVDFDFAGPAIHGSAVFGYEGWLAGYQMTFDSAKSKLTRNNFAVGYRTGDFQLHTNVNDGTEFGGSIYQKVCEDLDTSVNLAWTSGTNCTRFGIAAKYQLDPTASISAKVNNSSLIGVGYTQTLRPGVKLTLSALVDGKSINAGGHKVGLALELEA		P45880	Porin		7.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	t	f	f	f

26510189	Enzymatic Characterization of Recombinant Food Vacuole Plasmepsin 4 from the Rodent Malaria Parasite Plasmodium berghei.	The rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei is a practical model organism for experimental studies of human malaria. Plasmepsins are a class of aspartic proteinase isoforms that exert multiple pathological effects in malaria parasites. Plasmepsins residing in the food vacuole (FV) of the parasite hydrolyze hemoglobin in red blood cells. In this study, we cloned PbPM4, the FV plasmepsin gene of P. berghei that encoded an N-terminally truncated pro-segment and the mature enzyme from genomic DNA. We over-expressed this PbPM4 zymogen as inclusion bodies (IB) in Escherichia coli, and purified the protein following in vitro IB refolding. Auto-maturation of the PbPM4 zymogen to mature enzyme was carried out at pH 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5. Interestingly, we found that the PbPM4 zymogen exhibited catalytic activity regardless of the presence of the pro-segment. We determined the optimal catalytic conditions for PbPM4 and studied enzyme kinetics on substrates and inhibitors of aspartic proteinases. Using combinatorial chemistry-based peptide libraries, we studied the active site preferences of PbPM4 at subsites S1, S2, S3, S1&#39;, S2&#39; and S3&#39;. Based on these results, we designed and synthesized a selective peptidomimetic compound and tested its inhibition of PbPM4, seven FV plasmepsins from human malaria parasites, and human cathepsin D (hcatD). We showed that this compound exhibited a &gt;10-fold selectivity to PbPM4 and human malaria parasite plasmepsin 4 orthologs versus hcatD. Data from this study furthesr our understanding of enzymatic characteristics of the plasmepsin family and provides leads for anti-malarial drug design.	2015 Oct	Liu Peng,Robbins Arthur H,Marzahn Melissa R,McClung Scott H,Yowell Charles A,Stevens Stanley M,Dame John B,Dunn Ben M	PloS one. 10(10) e0141758	Plasmepsin 4	SEYLTIRAKIERPRDKLFKKVMNKNVSNYIKESFKLLKSGLLKKEHLTKYEDSIELDQSLGLSFIGTAELGNNKQSFSFILDTGSANLWVPSKECKSGGCAYKHRYDSSASNTYEKDGTPVSILYGSGGIKGFFSNDMFTIGHHTIPYKFIEVTETDDLEPIYTASPFDGILGLGWKSLAVGNVEPVIVEMKKTGQIENAVFSFYLPEADDSVGYFTIGGIEESFYTGDVTYEKLTNESYWQINLDVDFGIVALNNANAIVDSGTSAITAPSDFLNKFLNSIMSIPVPFIPLRIVLCHDTNLPTLKFRSKSTEYTIEPKHYLIELDPVGGICAISLIDVDIDANTFILGDVFFKKYYTIFDYDNSRVGFAVAKN	N-terminally truncated zymogen form (77 -450 aa)	Q4YR60	Aspartyl protease		8.0	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	f	f	f
26555181	High-yield soluble expression, purification and characterization of human steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) fused to a cleavable Maltose-Binding Protein (MBP).	Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is responsible for the rapid delivery of cholesterol to mitochondria where the lipid serves as a source for steroid hormones biosynthesis in adrenals and gonads. Despite many successful investigations, current understanding of the mechanism of StAR action is far from being completely clear. StAR was mostly obtained using denaturation/renaturation or in minor quantities in a soluble form at decreased temperatures that, presumably, limited the possibilities for its consequent detailed exploration. In our hands, existing StAR expression constructs could be bacterially expressed almost exclusively as insoluble forms, even upon decreased expression temperatures and in specific strains of Escherichia coli, and isolated protein tended to aggregate and was difficult to handle. To maximize the yield of soluble protein, optimized StAR sequence encompassing functional domain STARD1 (residues 66-285) was fused to the C-terminus of His-tagged Maltose-Binding Protein (MBP) with the possibility to cleave off the whole tag by 3C protease. The developed protocol of expression and purification comprising of a combination of subtractive immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and size-exclusion chromatography allowed us to obtain up to 25 mg/1 L culture of completely soluble StAR protein, which was (i) homogenous according to SDS-PAGE, (ii) gave a single symmetrical peak on a gel-filtration, (iii) showed the characteristic CD spectrum and (iv) pH-dependent ability to bind a fluorescently-labeled cholesterol analogue. We conclude that our strategy provides fully soluble and native StAR protein which in future could be efficiently used for biotechnology and drug discovery aimed at modulation of steroids production.	2016 Jan	Sluchanko Nikolai N,Tugaeva Kristina V,Faletrov Yaroslav V,Levitsky Dmitrii I	Protein expression and purification. 119 27-35	human steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR)	TLYSDQELAYLQQGEEAMQKALGILSNQEGWKKESQQDNGDKVMSKVVPDVGKVFRLEVVVDQPMERLYEELVERMEAMGEWNPNVKEIKVLQKIGKDTFITHELAAEAAGNLVGPRDFVSVRCAKRRGSTCVLAGMATDFGNMPEQKGVIRAEHGPTCMVLHPLAGSPSKTKLTWLLSIDLKGWLPKSIINQVLSQTQVDFANHLRKRLESHPASEARC	66-285 aa, N-terminal His6 and MBP tag	P49675	Plays a key role in steroid hormone synthesis by enhancing the metabolism of cholesterol into pregnenolone.

26603761	High production in E. coli of biologically active recombinant human fibroblast growth factor 20 and its neuroprotective effects.	Fibroblast growth factor 20 (FGF20) has a wide range of biological activities; its expression is most pronounced in neural tissues where it has functions in development and neuroprotection. Given these activities, interest in the clinical applications of FGF20 is rising, which will lead to increasing demand for active recombinant human FGF20 (rhFGF20). To improve the production of rhFGF20, an artificial gene encoding fgf20 was cloned into pET3a and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. By optimizing induction conditions, we successfully induced large amounts of insoluble rhFGF20. Following solubilization and refolding of the rhFGF20 from inclusion bodies, it was purified by HiTrap heparin affinity chromatography to a purity of over 96% with a yield of 218 mg rhFGF20/100 g wet cells. The purified rhFGF20 could stimulate proliferation of both NIH 3T3 cells and PC-12 cells, measured by the MTT assay. In a model of Aβ25-35-induced apoptosis on PC-12 cells, rhFGF20 had a clear protective effect. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related genes and proteins revealed that the FGF20-derived protective mechanism was likely due to the relief of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). In conclusion, the approach described here may be a better means to produce active rhFGF20 in good quantity, thereby allowing for its future pharmacological and clinical use.	2016 Mar	Tian Haishan,Zhao Yang,Chen Nazi,Wu Meiyu,Gong Weiyue,Zheng Jie,Fernig David G,Jungbauer Alois,Wang Dezhong,Li Xiaokun,Jiang Chao	Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 100(7) 3023-34	fibroblast growth factor 20	MAPLAEVGGFLGGLEGLGQQVGSHFLLPPAGERPPLLGERRSAAERSARGGPGAAQLAHLHGILRRRQLYCRTGFHLQILPDGSVQGTRQDHSLFGILEFISVAVGLVSIRGVDSGLYLGMNDKGELYGSEKLTSECIFREQFEENWYNTYSSNIYKHGDTGRRYFVALNKDGTPRDGARSKRHQKFTHFLPRPVDPERVPELYKDLLMYT		Q9NP95	Growth factor	full length	7.5	4	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
26690374	Investigation of TtrD, an expressing recombinant fusion tag, in Escherichia coli.	Escherichia coli is widely used for expressing recombinant proteins, and several tags have been developed to improve protein solubility. However, expressing and purifying protein from other organisms is not always successful. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using TtrD as an expressing fusion tag in E. coli. Twenty RING finger domain containing human genes were expressed in E. coli grown at 37 °C and 18 °C and tested with four other fusion tags, namely His, SUMO, GST and MBP, for comparison. The results indicated that the soluble expressing ability of the tags was MBP, GST, TtrD, SUMO, and His in descending order. A one-column refolding process was used to purify the expressed proteins in inclusion bodies, and TtrD showed the strongest refolding ability. The results suggested that the TtrD tag enhanced recombinant protein solubility and refolding ability and might be a useful tag for protein expression in E. coli.	2016 Jan	Chen Anqi,Zhang Li,Gu Shaohua,Tang Rong,Xie Yi,Ji Chaoneng	Protein expression and purification. 120 65-71	RING-box protein 2 isoform 1	MKHHHHHHGTSENLYFQGSMADVEDGEETCALASHSGSSGSKSGGDKMFSLKKWNAVAMWSWDVECDTCAICRVQVMDACLRCQAENKQEDCVVVWGECNHSFHNCCMSLWVKQNNRCPLCQQDWVVQRIGK	N-terminal His6 tag	Q9UBF6	Probable component of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction and transcription.

26692208	Molecular characterization of a cathepsin F-like protease in Trichinella spiralis.	BACKGROUND:Trichinellosis is a re-emerging infectious disease, caused by Trichinella spp. Cathepsin F belongs to cysteine protease that is a major virulence factor for parasitic helminths, and it may be a potential anti-helminth drug target and vaccine candidate. The aim of this study was to clone, express and identify a cathepsin F-like protease in Trichinella spiralis and to investigate its biochemical characteristics.METHODS:The full-length cDNA encoding a putative cathepsin F-like protease in T. spiralis, TsCF1, was cloned and its biochemical characterization and expression profile were analyzed. Transcription of TsCF1 at different developmental stages of T. spiralis was observed by RT-PCR. The recombinant TsCF1 protein was expressed by prokaryotic expression system and recombinant TsCF1 (rTsCF1) was analyzed by western blotting. And expression of TsCF1 at muscle larvae stage was performed by immunofluorescent technique. Molecular modeling of TsCF1 and its binding mode with E-64 and K11777 were analyzed. Enzyme activity and inhibitory test with E-64 as inhibitor were investigated by using Z-Phe-Arg-AMC as specific substrate.RESULTS:Sequence analysis revealed that TsCF1 ORF encodes a protein of 366 aa with a theoretical molecular weight of 41.9 kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.46. The cysteine protease conserved active site of Cys173, His309 and Asn333 were identified and cathepsin F specific motif ERFNAQ like KLFNAQ sequence was revealed in the propeptide of TsCF1. Sequence alignment analysis revealed a higher than 40  0dentity with other cathepsin F from parasitic helminth and phylogenetic analysis indicated TsCF1 located at the junction of nematode and trematode. RT-PCR revealed the gene was expressed in muscle larvae, newborn larvae and adult stages. SDS-PAGE revealed the recombinant protein was expressed with the molecular weight of 45 kDa. The purified rTsCF1 was used to immunize rabbit and the immune serum could recognize a band of about 46 kDa in soluble protein of adult, muscle larvae and ES product of muscle larvae. Immunolocalization analysis showed that TsCF1 located on the cuticle and stichosome of the muscle larvae. After renaturation rTsCF1 demonstrated substantial enzyme activity to Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate with the optimal pH 5.5 and this activity could be inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitor E-64. Further analysis showed the kinetic parameters of rTsCF1 to be Km = 0.5091 μM and Vmax = 6.12 RFU/s μM at pH 5.5, and the IC50 value of E64 was 135.50 ± 16.90 nM.CONCLUSION:TsCF1 was expressed in all stages of T. spiralis and localized in the cuticle and stichosome. TsCF1 might play a role in the life cycle of T. spiralis and could be used as a potential vaccine candidate and drug target against T. spiralis infection.	2015 Dec	Qu Zi-gang,Ma Xue-ting,Li Wen-hui,Zhang Nian-zhang,Yue Long,Cui Jian-min,Cai Jian-ping,Jia Wan-zhong,Fu Bao-quan	Parasites &amp; vectors. 8 652	cathepsin F-like protease	MKQKRPLFTNVNHLERYMDSKFDKNLLLKLLPEMNAKEARSWENFKQFMVEFNKWYETEKLTAEKYNIFKSNMVIAKRLQEEEQGTAIYGPTIFADMTPEEFRKTHLNFNPNNVKKPKRMANIPKSNISERMDWRKFNAVTSVKDQGNCGSCWAFCTVANIEGAWAVKTAQLISLSEQQLVDCDRLDDGCEGGLPVNAYLEIIRLGGLEKEEDYKYTARSGKCKFNHTKSAVYINDTVVLPEDEDAIARYVSENGPVAVGLNADAMMFYRSGIAHPSRLMCSPDGINHGVTIVGYDVKESLFWSTPYWIIKNSWGPNWGEKGYYYLYRGKGVCGIDQMASSVVID	22-366 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	E5SFB3	cysteine-type peptidase		8.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
26709825	Purification and Refolding to Amyloid Fibrils of (His)6-tagged Recombinant Shadoo Protein Expressed as Inclusion Bodies in E. coli.	The Escherichia coli expression system is a powerful tool for the production of recombinant eukaryotic proteins. We use it to produce Shadoo, a protein belonging to the prion family. A chromatographic method for the purification of (His)6-tagged recombinant Shadoo expressed as inclusion bodies is described. The inclusion bodies are solubilized in 8 M urea and bound to a Ni(2+)-charged column to perform ion affinity chromatography. Bound proteins are eluted by a gradient of imidazole. Fractions containing Shadoo protein are subjected to size exclusion chromatography to obtain a highly purified protein. In the final step purified Shadoo is desalted to remove salts, urea and imidazole. Recombinant Shadoo protein is an important reagent for biophysical and biochemical studies of protein conformation disorders occurring in prion diseases. Many reports demonstrated that prion neurodegenerative diseases originate from the deposition of stable, ordered amyloid fibrils. Sample protocols describing how to fibrillate Shadoo into amyloid fibrils at acidic and neutral/basic pHs are presented. The methods on how to produce and fibrillate Shadoo can facilitate research in laboratories working on prion diseases, since it allows for production of large amounts of protein in a rapid and low cost manner.	2015 Dec	Li Qiaojing,Richard Charles-Adrien,Moudjou Mohammed,Vidic Jasmina	Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE.(106) e53432	Shadoo	KGGRGG ARGSARGVRG GARGASRVRV RPAPRYGSSL RVAAAGAAAG AAAGVAAGLA TGSGWRRTSG PGELGLEDDE NGAMGGNGTD RGVYSYWAWT SG	25-122 aa, N-terminal His10 tag	Q8BWU1	Prion		7.4	4	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	t	f	f	t	f	f	f
26755413	Grafting iminodiacetic acid on silica nanoparticles for facilitated refolding of like-charged protein and its metal-chelate affinity purification.	A series of highly charged nanoscale chelators were fabricated by grafting of poly(glycidyl methacrylate-iminodiacetic acid) (pGI) chains with iminodiacetic acid (IDA) chelating group on silica nanoparticles (SNPs) via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The nanoscale chelators, denoted as SNPs-pGI, possessed a nickel ion chelating capacity as high as 2800 μmol/g, 50 times higher than the IDA-modified Sepharose FF (IDA-Sepharose) resin reported in literature and offered a high affinity binding capacity for hexahistidine-tagged enhanced green fluorescence protein (6 × His-EGFP) after nickel ion loading. More importantly, the anionic SNPs-pGI of high charge densities displayed much better performance than IDA-Sepharose in facilitating the refolding of like-charged 6 × His-EGFP from inclusion bodies (IBs). For example, for 0.2mg/mL 6 × His-EGFP IB refolding, addition of 6.2 μL/mL SNPs-pGI with the highest charge density led to a refolding yield of 90%, over 43 0gher than that obtained with 460 μL/mL IDA-Sepharose. It is notable that the much higher efficiency of the nanoscale chelator was obtained with a chelator consumption corresponding to only 1.40f IDA-Sepharose. Moreover, the highly charged SNPs-pGI could efficiently facilitate the refolding of 6 × His-EGFP at higher IB concentrations (0.4 and 0.8 mg/mL). After refolding, nickel ions addition led to the recovery of the refolded 6 × His-EGFP with high yield (80%), purity (96%) and enrichment ratio (1.8). All the results suggest that the SNPs-pGI of high charge densities were promising for cost-effective recovery of His-tagged proteins expressed as IBs with the integrative like-charge facilitated refolding and metal-chelate affinity purification strategy.	2016 Jan	Liu Hu,Dong Xiaoyan,Sun Yan	Journal of chromatography.

26783150	DSF Guided Refolding As A Novel Method Of Protein Production.	The Anfinsen hypothesis, the demonstration of which led to the Nobel prize in Chemistry, posits that all information required to determine a proteins&#39; three dimensional structure is contained within its amino acid sequence. This suggests that it should be possible, in theory, to fold any protein in vitro. In practice, however, protein production by refolding is challenging because suitable refolding conditions must be empirically determined for each protein and can be painstaking. Here we demonstrate, using a variety of proteins, that differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) can be used to determine and optimize conditions that favor proper protein folding in a rapid and high-throughput fashion. The resulting method, which we deem DSF guided refolding (DGR), thus enables the production of aggregation-prone and disulfide-containing proteins by refolding from E. coli inclusion bodies, which would not normally be amenable to production in bacteria.	2016 Jan	Biter Amadeo B,de la Peña Andres H,Thapar Roopa,Lin Jean Z,Phillips Kevin J	Scientific reports. 6 18906	irisin	DSPSAPVNVTVRHLKANSAVVSWDVLEDEVVIGFAISQQKKDVRMLRFIQEVNTTTRSCALWDLEEDTEYIVHVQAISIQGQSPASEPVLFKTPREAEKMASKNKDEVTMKE	32-143 aa, His tag	Q8NAU1	Hormone		8.5		t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t

26792557	Refolding, purification, and preliminary structural characterization of the DNA-binding domain of the quorum sensing receptor RhlR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.	RhlR is a 241-residue quorum sensing receptor that controls the expression of a myriad of virulence genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Here, the DNA sequence encoding the carboxi-terminal DNA-binding domain of RhlR was cloned into the pET-RP1B plasmid and expressed as an N-terminal fusion protein to the expression/purification Thio6His6 tag. The fusion construct expressed insolubly in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. The recombinant protein was extracted from the bacterial inclusion bodies and refolded in the presence of the charged amino acids l-arginine and l-glutamate. The refolded protein was purified by a combination of Ni(+2)-affinity and size exclusion chromatography, allowing the production of 2 mg of highly purified protein (&gt;951fb7850urity) per 5 mg of wet cells derived from 1 L culture. (1)H 1D NMR analysis revealed that the recombinant protein is folded. Moreover, a fluorescence anisotropy DNA-binding assay showed that the refolded protein is functional, as it recognizes the rhlAB promoter. This is the first time that a domain of the quorum sensing regulator RhlR was produced in sufficient amounts for structural studies, enabling the investigation of the molecular basis for RhlR specific interaction with DNA promoters.	2016 Mar	Lixa Carolina,Marques Adriana F,Cortines Juliana R,Neves Bianca C,Oliveira Danielle M P,Anobom Cristiane D,Lima Luís Maurício T R,Pinheiro Anderson S	Protein expression and purification. 121 31-40	RhlR	MGSDKIHHHHHHENLYFQGHMNPVCLSHREREILQWTADGKSSGEIAIILSISESTVNFHHKNIQKKFDAPNKTLAAAYAAALGLI	177-241 aa, N-terminal His6 tag	P54292	control the expression of a number of virulence factors	C-terminal DNA binding domain	7.2	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	t	f	f	t	f	f
26803749	Determination of structural elements on the folding reaction of mnemiopsin by spectroscopic techniques.	Mnemiopsin 1 is a member of photoprotein family, made up of 206 amino acid residues. These Ca(2+)-regulated photoproteins are responsible for light emission in a variety of marine cnidarians and ctenophores. They composed of an apoprotein, a single polypeptide chain of 25 kDa, molecular oxygen and the non-covalently bound chromophore. In this study, we examined whether three mutations, namely R39K, S128G and V183T affect the thermodynamic stability as well as refolding and unfolding kinetics of mnemiopsin 1. Conformational stability measurements using fluorescence and far-UV CD spectroscopies revealed that all variants unfold in multi-step manner in which the secondary and tertiary structures are lost in different steps. However kinetic studies showed that point mutation S128G destabilizes both kinetic intermediate and native conformation; while, these structural elements are stabilized in V183T. We also found that the stability of folded and intermediate states increases in R39K. We concluded that the initial packing of helical segments within the protein structure is more facilitated when Lys with smaller side chain is present in the protein chain.	2016 Feb	Hakiminia Forough,Khalifeh Khosrow,Sajedi Reza H,Ranjbar Bijan	Spectrochimica acta.

26826314	Improving the refolding efficiency for proinsulin aspart inclusion body with optimized buffer compositions.	Successfully recovering proinsulin&#39;s native conformation from inclusion body is the crucial step to guarantee high efficiency for insulin&#39;s manufacture. Here, two by-products of disulfide-linked oligomers and disulfide-isomerized monomers were clearly identified during proinsulin aspart&#39;s refolding through multiple analytic methods. Arginine and urea are both used to assist in proinsulin refolding, however the efficacy and possible mechanism was found to be different. The oligomers formed with urea were of larger size than with arginine. With the urea concentrations increasing from 2 M to 4 M, the content of oligomers decreased greatly, but simultaneously the refolding yield at the protein concentration of 0.5 mg/mL decreased from 400 30 0ue to the increase of disulfide-isomerized monomers. In contrast, with arginine concentrations increasing up to 1 M, the refolding yield gradually increased to 50% although the content for oligomers also decreased. Moreover, it was demonstrated that not redox pairs but only oxidant was necessary to facilitate the native disulfide bonds formation for the reduced denatured proinsulin. An oxidative agent of selenocystamine could increase the yield up to 80 0n the presence of 0.5 M arginine. Further study demonstrated that refolding with 2 M urea instead of 0.5 M arginine could achieve similar yield as protein concentration is slightly reduced to 0.3 mg/mL. In this case, refolded proinsulin was directly purified through one-step of anionic exchange chromatography, with a recovery of 32% and purity up to 95%. All the results could be easily adopted in insulin&#39;s industrial manufacture for improving the production efficiency.	2016 Apr	Chen Ying,Wang Qi,Zhang Chun,Li Xiunan,Gao Qiang,Dong Changqing,Liu Yongdong,Su Zhiguo	Protein expression and purification. 122 1-7	proinsulin aspart	MKRFVNQHLCGSHLVEALYLVCGERGFFYTDKTRREAEDLQVGQVELGGGPGAGSLQPLALEGSLQKRGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLENYCN		P01308	peptide hormone		10.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
26828455	Cholera toxin B subunit pentamer reassembled from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies for use in vaccination.	The cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) is secreted in its pentameric form from Escherichia coli if its leader peptide is replaced with one of E. coli origin. However, the secretion of the pentamer is generally severely impaired when the molecule is mutated or fused to a foreign peptide. Therefore, we attempted to regenerate pentameric CTB from the inclusion bodies (IBs) of E. coli. Stepwise dialysis of the IBs solubilized in guanidine hydrochloride predominantly generated soluble high-molecular-mass (HMM) aggregates and only a small fraction of pentamer. Three methods to reassemble homogeneous pentameric molecules were evaluated: (i) using a pentameric coiled-coil fusion partner, expecting it to function as an assembly core; (ii) optimizing the protein concentration during refolding; and (iii) eliminating contaminants before refolding. Coiled-coil fusion had some effect, but substantial amounts of HMM aggregates were still generated. Varying the protein concentration from 0.05 mg/mL to 5mg/mL had almost no effect. In contrast, eliminating the contaminants before refolding had a robust effect, and only the pentamer was regenerated, with no detectable HMM aggregates. Surprisingly, the protein concentration at refolding was up to 5mg/mL when the contaminants were removed, with no adverse effects on refolding.

26828455	Cholera toxin B subunit pentamer reassembled from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies for use in vaccination.	The cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) is secreted in its pentameric form from Escherichia coli if its leader peptide is replaced with one of E. coli origin. However, the secretion of the pentamer is generally severely impaired when the molecule is mutated or fused to a foreign peptide. Therefore, we attempted to regenerate pentameric CTB from the inclusion bodies (IBs) of E. coli. Stepwise dialysis of the IBs solubilized in guanidine hydrochloride predominantly generated soluble high-molecular-mass (HMM) aggregates and only a small fraction of pentamer. Three methods to reassemble homogeneous pentameric molecules were evaluated: (i) using a pentameric coiled-coil fusion partner, expecting it to function as an assembly core; (ii) optimizing the protein concentration during refolding; and (iii) eliminating contaminants before refolding. Coiled-coil fusion had some effect, but substantial amounts of HMM aggregates were still generated. Varying the protein concentration from 0.05 mg/mL to 5mg/mL had almost no effect. In contrast, eliminating the contaminants before refolding had a robust effect, and only the pentamer was regenerated, with no detectable HMM aggregates.

26831864	Enhancing the Yield of Active Recombinant Chitobiase by Physico-Chemical and In Vitro Refolding Studies.	Chitobiase (CHB) is an important enzyme for the production of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine from the chitin biopolymer in the series of chitinolytic enzymes. Majority of over-expressed CHB (58%) in E. coli expression system led to formation of inclusion bodies. The production and soluble yield of active CHB was enhanced by co-expression with GroEL/ES chaperonin, optimizing culture conditions and solubilization followed by refolding of remaining inactive chitobiase present in the form of inclusion bodies. The growth of recombinant E. coli produced 42% CHB in soluble form and the rest (~58%) as inclusion bodies. The percentage of active CHB was enhanced to 710y co-expression with GroEL/ES chaperonin system and optimizing culture conditions (37 °C, 200 rpm, IPTG--0.5 mM, L-arabinose--13.2 mM). Of the remaining inactive CHB present in inclusion bodies, 37could be recovered in active form using pulsatile dilution method involving denaturants (2 M urea, pH 12.5) and protein refolding studies (1.0 M L-arginine, 5 0lycerol). Using combinatorial approach, 800f the total CHB expressed, could be recovered from cells grown in one litre of LB medium is a step forward in replacing hazardous chemical technology by biotechnological process for the production of NAG from chitinous waste.	2016 Feb	Dangi Arun Kumar,Rishi Praveen,Tewari Rupinder	The protein journal. 35(1) 72-9	Chitobiase	MGPVMLDVEGYELDAEEREILAHPLVGGLILFTRNYHDPAQLRELVRQIRAASRNRLVVAVDQEGGRVQRFREGFTRLPAAQSFAALSGMEEGGKLAQEAGWLMASEMIAMDIDISFAPVLDVGHISAAIGERSYHADPQKALAIASRFIDGMHEAGMKTTGKHFPGHGAVTADSHKETPCDPRPQAEIRAKDMSVFSSLIRENKLDAIMPAHVIYSDVDPRPASGSPYWLKTVLRQELGFDGVIFSDDLSMEGAAIMGSYAERGQASLDAGCDMILVCNNRKGAVSVLDNLSPIKAERVTRLYHKGSFSRQELMDSARWKAISTRLNQLHERWQEEKAGH	N-terminal His6 tag	P75949	Glycosidase, Hydrolase		7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
26887678	Thiol-Disulfide Exchange in Human Growth Hormone.	PURPOSE:Thiol-disulfide exchange was monitored in recombinant human growth hormone (hGH) and in model tryptic peptides derived from hGH to investigate the effects of higher-order structure on the reaction.METHODS:Different free thiol-containing peptides, varying in length and amino acid sequence, were used to initiate the reaction at pH 7.0 and 37°C in hGH. Protein samples were digested with trypsin and analyzed for native disulfides, scrambled disulfides and free thiols using LC/MS. The loss of native disulfide and disulfide exchange was compared with model peptides derived from hGH.RESULTS:Loss of native disulfide in cyclic (cT20-T21) and linear peptides (T20-T21pep) derived from the C-terminal hGH disulfide during the first 60 min of reaction was greater than loss of the C-terminal disulfide in hGH itself. Of the thiols tested, glutathione (GSH) was the most reactive, forming the highest percentage of mixed disulfides in intact hGH and in the model peptides. At longer reaction times (&gt;240 min), native disulfides in both hGH and cT20-T21 were regenerated. The fastest rates of regeneration were observed for Cys and the di- or tripeptide containing an Arg residue adjacent to Cys, suggesting that they may be useful in refolding.CONCLUSIONS:Thiol-disulfide exchange reactions in hGH and related model peptides were influenced by higher order structure, by the size of the thiol reactant and by an Arg residue adjacent to Cys in the thiol reactant. Reduction of disulfide bonds in hGH did not affect higher order structure as measured by CD and HDX-MS.	2016 May	Chandrasekhar Saradha,Moorthy Balakrishnan S,Xie Ruichao,Topp Elizabeth M	Pharmaceutical research. 33(6) 1370-82	human growth hormone	FPTIPLSRLFDNAMLRAHRLHQLAFDTYQEFEEAYIPKEQKYSFLQNPQTSLCFSESIPTPSNREETQQKSNLELLRISLLLIQSWLEPVQFLRSVFANSLVYGASDSNVYDLLKDLEEGIQTLMGRLEDGSPRTGQIFKQTYSKFDTNSHNDDALLKNYGLLYCFRKDMDKVETFLRIVQCRSVEGSCGF	without signal peptide	P01241	Hormone	full length	8.0		f	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
26926590	TRAIL-CM4 fusion protein shows in vitro antibacterial activity and a stronger antitumor activity than solo TRAIL protein.	A TRAIL-CM4 fusion protein in soluble form with tumor selective apoptosis and antibacterial functions was expressed in the Escherichia coli expression system and isolated through dialysis refolding and histidine-tag Nickel-affinity purification. Fresh Jurkat cells were treated with the TRAIL-CM4 fusion protein. Trypan blue staining and MTT analyses showed that, similar to a TRAIL positive control, Jurkat cell proliferation was significantly inhibited. Flow cytometry analyses using Annexin V-fluorescein revealed that Jurkat cells treated with the TRAIL-CM4 fusion protein exhibited increased apoptosis. Laser confocal microscopy showed that APB-CM4 and the fusion protein TRAIL-CM4 can bind to Jurkat cell membranes and initiate their destruction. ABP-CM4 enhances the antitumor activity of TRAIL by targeting and damaging the tumor cell membrane. In antibacterial experiments, agar well diffusion and bacterial growth inhibition curve assays revealed concentration-dependent TRAIL-CM4 antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli K12D31. The expressed TRAIL-CM4 fusion protein exhibited enhanced antitumor and antibacterial activities.

26989746	Refolding process of cysteine-rich proteins:Chitinase as a model.	BACKGROUND:Recombinant proteins overexpressed in E. coli are usually deposited in inclusion bodies. Cysteines in the protein contribute to this process. Inter- and intra- molecular disulfide bonds in chitinase, a cysteine-rich protein, cause aggregation when the recombinant protein is overexpressed in E. coli. Hence, aggregated proteins should be solubilized and allowed to refold to obtain native- or correctly- folded recombinant proteins.METHODS:Dilution method that allows refolding of recombinant proteins, especially at high protein concentrations, is to slowly add the soluble protein to refolding buffer. For this purpose: first, the inclusion bodies containing insoluble proteins were purified; second, the aggregated proteins were solubilized; finally, the soluble proteins were refolded using glutathione redox system, guanidinium chloride, dithiothreitol, sucrose, and glycerol, simultaneously.RESULTS:After protein solubilization and refolding, SDS-PAGE showed a 32 kDa band that was recognized by an anti-chitin antibody on western blots.CONCLUSIONS:By this method, cysteine-rich proteins from E. coli inclusion bodies can be solubilized and correctly folded into active proteins.	2016 Mar	Moghadam Malihe,Ganji Ali,Varasteh Abdolreza,Falak Reza,Sankian Mojtaba	Reports of biochemistry &amp; molecular biology. 4(1) 19-24	Class IV chitinase	AQNCGCASGLCCSKYGYCGTGSDYCGDGCQSGPCDSSSGSGSSVSDIVTQSFFDGIINQAASSCAGKNFYTRAAFLSALNSYSGFGNDGSTDANKREIAAFFAHVTHETGHFCYIEEINGASHNYCDSSNTQYPCVSGQNYYGRGPLQLTWNYNYGAAGNSIGFNGLSNPGIVATDVVTSFKTALWFWMNNVHSVIGQGFGATIRAINGAVECNGGNTAAVNARVQYYKDYCSQLGVSPGDNLTC	20-264 aa, C-terminal His6 tag	Q7XAU6	chitinase		8.5	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
27007382	Preparation and Antitumor Activity of CS5931, A Novel Polypeptide from Sea Squirt Ciona Savignyi.	CS5931 is a novel anticancer agent isolated from the sea squirt Ciona savignyi. However, its content in the species is very low, and developing a novel approach for production of the polypeptide is promising. In the present study, we expressed and purified the polypeptide from E. coli, and the fermentation conditions were studied using response surface methodology. The yield of CS5931 was increased from 2.0 to 7.5 mg/L. The denaturing and renaturation conditions were also studied. Using the optimized renaturation condition, the anticancer activity of refolding CS5931 was increased significantly; the value of IC50 was decreased from 23.2 to 11.6 μM. In vivo study using xenograft nude mice bearing HCT116 cancer cells revealed that CS5931 was able to inhibit the growth of tumor significantly. The study provides a useful approach for obtaining enough amount of CS5931 for further study. This study is also important for developing the polypeptide as a novel anticancer agent.	2016 Mar	Chen Xiaoshuang,Xu Huanli,Li Bo,Wang Feng,Chen Xiaoliang,Kong Dexin,Lin Xiukun	Marine drugs. 14(3)	CS5931	MVVCPDGQSECPDGNTCCKLASGQYGCCPQPNAVCCSDHIHCCPEGYTCNVGGGTCVK	N-terminal His6 tag, 1-58 aa	I4BZJ6	antitumor polypeptide				f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
27017875	Effects of mutations on the structure and function of silkworm type 1 acetylcholinesterase.	AChE is the target of organophosphate (OP) and carbamate (CB) pesticides, and mutations in the gene can significantly reduce insects&#39; sensitivity to these pesticides. Bombyx mori is highly sensitive to pesticides. To investigate the effects of mutations on AChE1 structure and function, we used a prokaryotic system to express B.mori wild type AChE1 (wAChE1) and mutant AChE1 (mAChE1) in this study. Active AChE1 proteins were obtained after refolding and purification, and wAChE1 and mAChE1 had similar activities. After incubation with 10(-6)M physostigmine and 10(-3)mg/mL phoxim, the remaining enzyme activity of mAChE1 was 4.42% and 8.86 0gher than that of wAChE1&#39;s, respectively. Three-dimensional analysis of mutation AChE1 (mAChE1) revealed that the Ser and Ala side chains extended toward the central part of S285 with distances of just 2.80Å and 3.68Å, respectively, which changed the spatial structure of the active center and reduced its sensitivity to pesticides. These results indicated that the mutations altered the 3D structure of AChE1, which may affect the binding of physostigmine and phoxim to the serine residue at the active center, leading to reduced sensitivity. Our study helps understand the relationship between AChE1 mutations and pesticide resistance and provides a new direction for the cultivation of new pesticide-resistant varieties of B.mori.	2016 Mar	Wang B B,Li F C,Xu K Z,Ni M,Hu J S,Tian J H,Li Y Y,Shen W D,Li B	Pesticide biochemistry and physiology. 129 1-6	AChE1	MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMGPHEHRARHHAPAPPQPYHGHGEAVRYNPELDTILPRLEDHETSSKRASDAETSSKRTKYEERFYSNHERAAELMADEPVSEKGDEEDPLVIRTRKGKVRGITLTSATGKKVDAWFGIPYAQKPMGDLRFRHPRPVEDWGDEILNTTTLPHSCVQIVDTVFGDFPGAMMWNPNTDMQEDCLYINIVTPRPRPKNAAVMLWVFGGGFYSGTATLDVYDPKILVSEEKVVYVSMQYRVASLGFLFFDTADVPGNAGLFDQLMALQWVKDNIGYFGGNPHNITLFGESAGAVSVSLHLLSPLSRNLFSQAIMQSGAATAPWAIISREESILRGIRLAEAVHCPHSRSDLAPMIECLRKKNADELVNNEWGTLGICEFPFVPIIDGSFLDEMPVRSLAHQNFKKTNILMGSNTEEGYYFILYYLTELFPKEENVGISREQFLQAVRELNPYVNDVARQAIIYEYTDWLNPEDPVKNRNALDKMVGDYHFTCGVNEFAHRYAETGNNVYTYYYKHRSKNNPWPSWTGVMHADEINYVFGEPLNPGKNYSPEEVEFSKRLMRYWANFARSGNPSLNPNGEMTKIHWPVHTAFGREYLSLAVNSSSVGRGLRVKQCAFWQKHLPQLMAATNKPEPPKNCTNSVPSLWPSRNTLGFNVIATAALTGTALFKYTI	N-terminal HIs6 tag, without signal peptide	Q2Q5Z2	AChE, mainly present in neurons and neuromuscular junctions, catalyzes and hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) to maintain normal nerve impulses.		8.5		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f
27088505	Influence of Conformation of M. tuberculosis RNase P Protein Subunit on Its Function.	RNase P is an essential enzyme that processes 5&#39; end leader sequence of pre-tRNA to generate mature tRNA. The bacterial RNase Ps contain a RNA subunit and one protein subunit, where the RNA subunit contains the catalytic activity. The protein subunit which lacks any catalytic activity, relaxes the ionic requirements for holoenzyme reaction and is indispensable for pre-tRNA cleavage in vivo. In the current study, we reconstituted the M. tuberculosis RNase P holoenzyme in vitro. We prepared the RNase P protein through two different strategies that differ in the conditions under which the recombinant M. tuberculosis protein, expressed in E. coli was purified. The mycobacterial RNase P protein which was purified under native conditions subsequent to isolation from inclusion bodies and in vitro renaturation, was capable of cleaving pre-tRNA specifically without the requirement of RNase P RNA. However, the preparation that was purified under denaturing conditions and refolded subsequently lacked any inherent pre-tRNA processing activity and cleaved the substrate only as a component of the holoenzyme with the RNA subunit. We found that the two RNase P protein preparations attained alternative conformations and differed with respect to their stability as well.	2016 Apr	Singh Alla,Ubaid-Ullah Shah,Ramteke Anup K,Batra Janendra K	PloS one. 11(4) e0153798	RNase P Protein Subunit	LIATPGLFAVLRARNRMRRSADFETTVKHGMRTVRSDMVVYWWRGSGGGPRVGLIIAKSVGSAVERHRVARRLRHVAGSIVKELHPSDHVVIRALPSSRHVSSARLEQQLRCGLRRAVELAGSDR		A5U9Q1	Endonuclease, Hydrolase, Nuclease	full length	8		f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	t	f	f	f	f

27095967	Functionally Expression of Metalloproteinase in Taenia solium Metacestode and Its Evaluation for Serodiagnosis of Cysticercosis.	BACKGROUND:Parasite proteases have important roles in cleavage of host proteins during the invasion of host tissues and participate in the parasite&#39;s evasion from the host&#39;s immune response. The aim of the present study was to estimate a metalloproteinase properties of Taenia solium metacestode (TsMP) during host-parasite interactions, and evaluate its potential as a serodiagnostic antigen for cysticercosis.METHODS:The cDNA coding for the mature catalytic domain of TsMP was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 expression vector. A recombinant glutathione S-transferase and TsMP fusion protein was induced. After refolding and purification, enzymatic properties of the recombinant metalloproteinase were observed. Immunoblot assay was processed to evaluate its potential as a serodiagnostic antigen for cysticercosis.RESULTS:The recombinant TsMP protein showed proteolytic activity, which preferred host extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and fibronectin as degradable substrates. In immunoblot assay, 87.50f sera from patients with cysticercosis showed strong reactivity. In sera from patients with other parasitic infections and from normal controls, it showed high specificity.CONCLUSIONS:TsMP might be involved in the processing of numerous host proteins and play an important role in the parasite life cycle. A single recombinant TsMP antigen could have a potential value for serodiagnosis of cysticercosis.	2016 Apr	Zhang Ying,Bae Young-An,Zong Hong-Ying,Kong Yoon,Cai Guo-Bin	Iranian journal of parasitology. 11(1) 35-45	metalloproteinase	PDCELRKKIEELAASIEFPLKKLYVVEGSKRSSHSNAYFYGFGKNKRIVLFDTLIKGFKMPGVEADSSANADESSDETQNRGCGDDEEILATLAHELGHWKLKHMTFNLIIAQINIFFMFFAFGQLINVDQLFVDFGFPPSTAPILIRLIVVFQFIFMPYSSVLEFLMTMLSRKFEFQADAFAVSLKSGEKLKSALLVLTKDNLSFPVYDWLYSMCNHSHPPIIERLAAIDAKMGKEK	N-terminal GST tag, 235-472 aa	Q3Y6B8	metalloendopeptidase		7.5	4	f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f

27247796	Cloning, Expression, and Cost Effective Purification of Authentic Human Epidermal Growth Factor With High Activity.	BACKGROUND:Epidermal growth factor (EGF) plays a fundamental role in the healing of wounds relating to skin damage, the cornea, and the gastrointestinal tract.OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study is the cloning, expression, and purification of recombinant human EGF (rhEGF), and an assessment of its activity.MATERIALS AND METHODS:In the present experimental study, a synthetic pET28a (+) -hEGF construct was prepared. In order to ligate hEGF into pET24a (+), the PCR technique was performed, using special primers that possess restriction enzyme sites, which are also located in appropriate sites in pET24a (+). After transferring this construct into E. coli cells, protein expression was performed under standard conditions. Protein solubilization was done by urea. hEGF purification and refolding were carried out using gradient dialysis against the urea. We used RP-HPLC to compare between rhEGF and commercial rhEGF as a control. Finally, an MTT assay was performed to assess the viability of the NIH 3T3 cells treated with various concentrations of rhEGF.RESULTS:Dialysis after urea solubilization caused precipitation of unwanted proteins, resulting in achievement of purified EGF with &gt; 901fb7850urity, without the need for expensive and time-consuming process. The MTT assay results showed that our rhEGF activate significantly higher proliferation of NIH 3T3 cells in comparison to the control (P-values were &lt; 0.0001), in total concentrations and times evaluatedCONCLUSIONS:Via our purification protocol, a sufficient amount of bioactive recombinant human epidermal growth factor was obtained in just a few affordable steps, with superlative purity.	2016 Jun	Pouranvari Sara,Ebrahimi Firouz,Javadi Gholamreza,Maddah Bozorgmehr	Iranian Red Crescent medical journal. 18(3) e24966	Epidermal growth factor	NSDSECPLSHDGYCLHDGVCMYIEALDKYACNCVVGYIGERCQYRDLKWWELR	971-1023 aa	P01133	Growth factor				f	t	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
27301759	Large-scale purification and characterization of recombinant human stem cell factor in Escherichia coli.	Pharmacological importance of recombinant human stem cell factor (rhSCF) has increased the demand to establish effective and large-scale production and purification processes. A good source of bioactive recombinant protein with capability of being scaled-up without losing activity has always been a challenge. Rapid and efficient of the pilot-scale expression and purification of recombinant hSCF were the objective. The gene encoding SCF was cloned into pBV220 and transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli). The recombinant SCF was expressed and isolated using a procedure consisted of isolation of inclusion bodies, denaturation and refolding followed by chromatographic steps towards purification. The yield of rhSCF reached 835.6 g/20 L, and the expression levels of rhSCF were about 33.9 0f the total E. coli protein content. rhSCF was purified by isolation of inclusion bodies, denaturation and refolding, followed by SP-Sepharose, Source 30 reversed phase chromatography (RPC) and Q-Sepharose chromatographies. This procedure was developed to isolate 5.5 grams of rhSCF (99.5 1fb7850urity) with specific activity at 0.96 × 10(6)  IU/mg, endotoxin levels of pyrogen at 1.0 EU/mg, and bacterial DNA at 10 ng/mg. Pilot-scale fermentations and purifications were set up for production of rhSCF that can be upscaled for industry. This article is protected by copyright.

27318838	Cataract-causing mutation S228P promotes βB1-crystallin aggregation and degradation by separating two interacting loops in C-terminal domain.	β/γ-Crystallins are predominant structural proteins in the cytoplasm of lens fiber cells and share a similar fold composing of four Greek-key motifs divided into two domains. Numerous cataract-causing mutations have been identified in various β/γ-crystallins, but the mechanisms underlying cataract caused by most mutations remains uncharacterized. The S228P mutation in βB1-crystallin has been linked to autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract. Here we found that the S228P mutant was prone to aggregate and degrade in both of the human and E. coli cells. The intracellular S228P aggregates could be redissolved by lanosterol. The S228P mutation modified the refolding pathway of βB1-crystallin by affecting the formation of the dimeric intermediate but not the monomeric intermediate. Compared with native βB1-crystallin, the refolded S228P protein had less packed structures, unquenched Trp fluorophores and increased hydrophobic exposure. The refolded S228P protein was prone to aggregate at the physiological temperature and decreased the protective effect of βB1-crystallin on βA3-crystallin. Molecular dynamic simulation studies indicated that the mutation decreased the subunit binding energy and modified the distribution of surface electrostatic potentials. More importantly, the mutation separated two interacting loops in the C-terminal domain, which shielded the hydrophobic core from solvent in native βB1-crystallin. These two interacting loops are highly conserved in both of the N- and C-terminal domains of all β/γ-crystallins. We propose that these two interacting loops play an important role in the folding and structural stability of β/γ-crystallin domains by protecting the hydrophobic core from solvent access.	2016 Jul	Qi Liang-Bo,Hu Li-Dan,Liu Huihui,Li Hai-Yun,Leng Xiao-Yao,Yan Yong-Bin	Protein &amp; cell. 7(7) 501-15	Beta-crystallin B1	MSQAAKASASATVAVNPGPDTKGKGAPPAGTSPSPGTTLAPTTVPITSAKAAELPPGNYRLVVFELENFQGRRAEFSGECSNLADRGFDRVRSIIVSAGPWVAFEQSNFRGEMFILEKGEYPRWNTWSSSYRSDRLMSFRPIKMDAQEHKISLFEGANFKGNTIEIQGDDAPSLWVYGFSDRVGSVKVSSGTWVGYQYPGYRGYQYLLEPGDFRHWNEWGAFQPQMQPLRRLRDKQWHLEGSFPVLATEPPK	N-terminal His6 tag, S228P mutant (wilid type is soluble)	P53674	Eye lens protein	full length	7.0	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	t	f	f	t	f	f	f
24421036	Potent malaria transmission-blocking antibody responses elicited by Plasmodium falciparum Pfs25 expressed in Escherichia coli after successful protein refolding.	Production of Pfs25, a Plasmodium falciparum transmission-blocking vaccine target antigen, in functional conformation with the potential to elicit effective immunogenicity still remains a major challenge. In the current study, codon-harmonized recombinant Pfs25 (CHrPfs25) was expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified protein after simple oxidative refolding steps retained reduction-sensitive conformational epitopes of transmission-blocking monoclonal antibodies. CHrPfs25 formulated in several adjuvants elicited strong immunogenicity in preclinical studies in mice. Antibodies elicited after immunization recognized native Pfs25 on the surface of live gametes of P. falciparum and demonstrated complete malaria transmission-blocking activity. The transmission-blocking efficacy was 100 0.000000e+00ven after a 1:128 dilution of sera from immunized mice in the complete Freund&#39;s adjuvant and Montanide ISA51 groups and after a 1:16 dilution of sera from mice in the alum group. The blocking was mediated by antibodies; purified IgG at concentrations as low as 31.25 μg/ml exhibited 100% transmission blocking in membrane feeding assays employing two different species of mosquitoes, Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles stephensi. This study provides the first evidence for successful expression of biologically functional rPfs25 in E. coli. The extremely potent malaria transmission-blocking activity of antibodies elicited by immunization with purified protein provides strong support for further evaluation of E. coli-derived CHrPfs25 as a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine in human clinical trials.	2014 Mar	Kumar Rajesh,Angov Evelina,Kumar Nirbhay	Infection and immunity. 82(4) 1453-9	Pfs25	IKYNNAKVTVDTVCKRGFLIQMSGHLECKCENDLVLVNEETCEEKVLKCDEKTVNKPCGDFSKCIKIDGNPVSYACKCNLGYDMVNNVCIPNECKNVTCGNGKCILDTSNPVKTGVCSCNIGKVPNVQDQNKCSKDGETKCSLKCLKENETCKAVDGIYKCDCKDGFIIDNESSICTAF		P13829	transmission-blocking vaccine target antigen	EGF-like domains 1, 2, 3, and 4	6.9	4	f	t	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f	f	f	f
25493352	Classification of chemical chaperones based on their effect on protein folding landscapes.	Various small molecules present in biological systems can assist protein folding in vitro and are known as chemical chaperones. De novo design of chemical chaperones with higher activity than currently known examples is desirable to ameliorate protein misfolding and aggregation in multiple contexts. However, this development has been hindered by limited knowledge of their activities. It is thought that chemical chaperones are typically poor solvents for a protein backbone and hence facilitate native structure formation. However, it is unknown if different chemical chaperones can act differently to modulate folding energy landscapes. Using a model slow folding protein, double-mutant Maltose-binding protein (DM-MBP), we show that a canonical chemical chaperone, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), accelerates refolding by decreasing the flexibility of the refolding intermediate (RI). Among a number of small molecules that chaperone DM-MBP folding, proline and serine stabilize the transition state (TS) enthalpically, while trehalose behaves like TMAO and increases the rate of barrier crossing through nonenthalpic processes. We propose a two-group classification of chemical chaperones based upon their thermodynamic effect on RI and TS, which is also supported by single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) studies. Interestingly, for a different test protein, the molecular mechanisms of the two groups of chaperones are not conserved. This provides a glimpse into the complexity of chemical chaperoning activity of osmolytes. Future work would allow us to engineer synergism between the two classes to design more efficient chemical chaperones to ameliorate protein misfolding and aggregation problems.	2015 Mar	Dandage Rohan,Bandyopadhyay Anannya,Jayaraj Gopal Gunanathan,Saxena Kanika,Dalal Vijit,Das Aritri,Chakraborty Kausik	ACS chemical biology. 10(3) 813-20	DM-MBP	KIEEGKLVIWINGDKGYCGLAEVGKKFEKDTGIKVTVEHPDKLEEKFPQVAATGDGPDIIFWAHDRFGGYAQSGLLAEITPDKAFQDKLYPFTWDAVRYNGKLIAYPIAVEALSLIYNKDLLPNPPKTWEEIPALDKELKAKGKSALMFNLQEPYFTWPLIAADGGYAFKYENGKYDIKDVGVDNAGAKAGLTFLVDLIKNKHMNADTDYSIAEAAFNKGETAMTINGPWAWSNIDTSKVNYGVTVLPTFKGQPSKPFVGVLSAGINAASPNKELAKEFLENYLLTDEGLEAVNKCKPLGAVALKSYEEELAKDPRIAATMENAQKGEIMPNIPQMSAFWYAVRTAVINAASGRQTVDEALKDAQTRITK		A0A0B5JXW7	Maltose binding protein	Maltose transporter subunit	7.4	20	t	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	f

23894676	Refolding of a thermostable glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase for application in synthetic cascade biomanufacturing.	The production of chemicals from renewable resources is gaining importance in the light of limited fossil resources. One promising alternative to widespread fermentation based methods used here is Synthetic Cascade Biomanufacturing, the application of minimized biocatalytic reaction cascades in cell free processes. One recent example is the development of the phosphorylation independent conversion of glucose to ethanol and isobutanol using only 6 and 8 enzymes, respectively. A key enzyme for this pathway is aldehyde dehydrogenase from Thermoplasma acidophilum, which catalyzes the highly substrate specific oxidation of d-glyceraldehyde to d-glycerate. In this work the enzyme was recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli. Using matrix-assisted refolding of inclusion bodies the yield of enzyme production was enhanced 43-fold and thus for the first time the enzyme was provided in substantial amounts. Characterization of structural stability verified correct refolding of the protein. The stability of the enzyme was determined by guanidinium chloride as well as isobutanol induced denaturation to be ca. -8 kJ/mol both at 25°C and 40°C. The aldehyde dehydrogenase is active at high temperatures and in the presence of small amounts of organic solvents. In contrast to previous publications, the enzyme was found to accept NAD(+) as cofactor making it suitable for application in the artificial glycolysis.	2013 Jul	Steffler Fabian,Sieber Volker	PloS one. 8(7) e70592	Glyceraldehyde Dehydrogenase (TaAlDH)	MDTKLYIDGQWVNSSSGKTVDKYSPVTGQVIGRFEAATRDDVDRAIDAAEDAFWAWNDLGSVERSKIIYRAKELIEKNRAELENIIMEENGKPVKEAKEEVDGVIDQIQYYAEWARKLNGEVVEGTSSHRKIFQYKVPYGIVVALTPWNFPAGMVARKLAPALLTGNTVVLKPSSDTPGSAEWIVRKFVEAGVPKGVLNFITGRGSEIGDYIVEHKKVNLITMTGSTATGQRIMQKASANMAKLILELGGKAPFMVWKDADMDNALKTLLWAKYWNAGQSCIAAERLYVHEDIYDTFMSRFVELSRKLALGDPKNADMGPLINKGALQATSEIVEEAKESGAKILFGGSQPSLSGPYRNGYFFLPTIIGNADQKSKIFQEEIFAPVIGARKISSVEEMYDLANDSKYGLASYLFTKDPNIIFEASERIRFGELYVNMPGPEASQGYHTGFRMTGQAGEGSKYGISEYLKLKNIYVDYSGKPLHINTVRDDLFQ		Q9HK01	aldehyde dehydrogenase	full length	8	4	t	f	f	f	f	f	t	f	f	t	t	f	f	f
